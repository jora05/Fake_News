The decision has been taken because the speeding was detected by an uncertified speed camera. Some 1,871 drivers were caught speeding on the N17 in County Mayo on the west coast of Ireland between 20 December 2024 and 12 February 2025. They were all issued with fixed charge notices. The speeding was detected by a static speed safety camera system, and it is standard procedure for all cameras used for speeding detection to have valid calibration certificates issued by the GoSafe camera provider. Gardaí (Irish police) have explained that in conjunction with GoSafe they discovered that the camera, located near the town of Claremorris, was fully functional and accurately identifying offences, but it was not certified. This discovery was made on 12 February and the decision to quash fines and points was announced on Friday. Some of the motorists who were caught speeding on the busy road have already paid fines and they will now be refunded. A full breakdown of the figures shows that 800 notices were paid and penalty points applied while a further 123 fines were paid but the error was identified before these drivers were given penalty points. Garda Ch Supt Jane Humphries said ""this error is very much regretted"". However, she added: ""The level of speeding breaches issued since the camera went operational on December 20, 2024 demonstrates the continued need for all motorists using this road to slow down."" A spokesperson for the camera provider said: ""At GoSafe, we are committed to maintaining the highest standards of quality and safety. During a routine quality assurance check, we identified that the calibration certificate for radar components in a static speed camera on the N17 in Mayo had expired."" ""To prevent a recurrence, we have implemented enhanced safeguards within our quality assurance process,"" the spokesperson added. Motorists impacted by error are now being notified by gardaí. The speed safety camera system went live on 20 December 2024. It was not operational between 1 January 2025 and 17 January 2025 as it had been vandalised. This means that all the 1,871 speeding notices were issued over a period of 39 operational days. The N17 became part of Irish folklore after an Irish band, The Saw Doctors, released a song of the same name around 1990. It was a nostalgic Irish emigration song at the height of mass emigration from the country and the band subsequently became hugely popular in Ireland and among Irish communities in the UK and US as well as in other parts of the world."

Several tankers and a locomotive were ablaze, with firefighters from several regions and a mobile chemical laboratory deployed to the area, according to local media. A massive cloud of dense black smoke was visible for several kilometres. Railway officials say nobody was injured in the incident, which occurred near Hustopeče nad Bečvou, 50km (31 miles) south-west of the Polish border, on Friday. Benzene, which is a cancer-causing substance for humans, is an element present in aircraft fuel. The train ""split apart"" and subsequently derailed, according to initial reports. A nearby electric substation also caught fire, killing power to the nearby town of Hustopeče. Flames up to 20m high were visible when the fire broke out, one eyewitness told the Lidove Noviny newspaper. Dramatic drone footage from the scene, released by the Czech fire service, shows several badly charred and destroyed tankers - some still burning as thick black smoke spews into the sky. Firefighters used heavy foam to prevent the fire spreading further, while other tankers were hosed down to prevent more explosions. A helicopter was also deployed, as well as a special chemical monitoring mobile lab. It took several hours to bring the fire under control, officials said. The fire affected around 15 of the 17 benzene tanks the train had been transporting, a fire department spokesperson told local media. ""The substance should be the same in all tankers, the amount will be specified, but it is approximately 60 tonnes in one tanker. However, this does not mean that everything will burn out or leak,"" Lucie Balážová said. The fire service later said the estimated cost of the damage the fire had caused was 125 million Czech koruna (£4.1m). Locals have been told to stay indoors and not open windows or doors. Officials say air quality ""has not yet exceeded"" any pollution limits, according to Czech news website iDNES. Police say they will investigate the cause of the derailment. Benzene is a colourless or light-yellow liquid with a sweet smell that can evaporate very quickly. It is used in common substances like plastic, resin, nylon and some forms of dyes, pesticides or detergents. It is very flammable. Exposure to benzene through breathing or ingestion can cause symptoms like drowsiness, dizziness, tremors, vomiting or sleeplessness. Very high levels of exposure can lead to unconsciousness or death, according to the CDC. Long-term exposure of a year or more could cause issues with blood, bone marrow or the immune system."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e44qev1dvo,Minister questions why Tate brothers were allowed to leave Romania,2025-02-28T15:57:24.153Z,Nick Thorpe & Hafsa Khalil,"Romania's Justice Minister Radu Marinescu has called for a public explanation into why controversial social media influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate were allowed to leave the country on Thursday. The brothers - who are currently facing charges including human trafficking in Romania - had been under a travel ban for more than two years before it was lifted, allowing them to fly to the US. Marinescu has asked the special prosecution service, Diicot, to ""conduct any investigation necessary to uncover the truth promptly, correctly, and impartially"". Andrew, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, have strongly denied the allegations against them. The brothers are dual US-UK citizens, and were first arrested in Romania in 2022, where they are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. They spent several months under house arrest in Romania, before prosecutors announced on Thursday that the travel ban had been lifted and the pair's US passports had been returned to them. Despite this, investigations into their alleged crimes have not been dropped and they are expected to return to Romania. In the US they also face a civil case from a woman who alleges the brothers coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. The brothers also face separate charges in the UK of rape and human trafficking. On Friday, four British women who have accused Andrew Tate of rape and coercive control urged the UK government to ""immediately request Tate's extradition from the US to the UK to face justice"". They said in a joint statement that if it did not, ""it won't just be us it will be failing, but all British victims of alleged sexual violence"". They added: ""We do not doubt the home secretary's personal commitment to victims of sexual violence, but we need action, not words."" The brothers' exit has sparked concerns that Romanian prosecutors felt political pressure from the Trump administration. On Thursday, the US president said he knew nothing about their release. Romania's justice minister said the Tate brothers ""risk pre-trial detention"" if they fail to return to Romania to face continued investigation in the cases against them. But international human rights lawyer Silvia Tabusca, who has been following the proceedings, does not believe the brothers will return to Romania. She told the BBC Andrew Tate was ""technically correct"" when, upon arriving in Florida, he said there was no live indictment against him and his brother, because a second case has not yet been presented to a judge. In December 2024, the Court of Appeals in Bucharest ruled that an original indictment - the first case - which was issued in June 2023 could not proceed to trial in its current form. In August, Romanian authorities began a second investigation over new allegations of trafficking of minors, sexual intercourse with a minor and money laundering. When both cases have been submitted to the court, they will become live. ""It's actually a sort of lull in the two cases against them,"" Ms Tabusca explained. ""A big question mark hangs over whether they will ever return there to face trial, what the US government would do in such a situation, and what pressure the UK government is putting on the US to extradite them to the UK to face trial on another set of charges there."" Romania's justice minister said the Tate brothers ""risk pre-trial detention"" if they fail to return to Romania to face continued investigation in the cases against them. ""There are legal mechanisms in place to resolve this situation,"" Marinescu said, which could be a reference to the extradition treaty between the US and Romania. Calls for a public explanation of why their travel ban was lifted comes as many Romanians express concern that there appears to be one law for the rich and influential, and another for ordinary citizens."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czxnnzz558eo,Dozens arrested in global hit against AI-generated child abuse,2025-02-28T11:59:58.404Z,Jack Burgess,"At least 25 arrests have been made during a worldwide operation against child abuse images generated by artificial intelligence (AI), the European Union's law enforcement organisation Europol has said. The suspects were part of a criminal group whose members engaged in distributing fully AI-generated images of minors, according to the agency. The operation is one of the first involving such child sexual abuse material (CSAM), Europol said. The lack of national legislation against these crimes made it ""exceptionally challenging for investigators"", it added. Arrests were made simultaneously on Wednesday 26 February during Operation Cumberland, led by Danish law enforcement, a statement said. Authorities from at least 18 other countries have been involved and the operation is still continuing, with more arrests expected in the next few weeks, Europol said. In addition to the arrests, so far 272 suspects have been identified, 33 house searches have been conducted and 173 electronic devices have been seized, according to the agency. It also said the main suspect was a Danish national who was arrested in November 2024. The statement said he ""ran an online platform where he distributed the AI-generated material he produced"". After making a ""symbolic online payment"", users from around the world were able to get a password that allowed them to ""access the platform and watch children being abused"". The agency said online child sexual exploitation was one of the top priorities for the European Union's law enforcement organisations, which were dealing with ""an ever-growing volume of illegal content"". Europol added that even in cases when the content was fully artificial and there was no real victim depicted, such as with Operation Cumberland, ""AI-generated CSAM still contributes to the objectification and sexualisation of children"". Europol's executive director Catherine De Bolle said: ""These artificially generated images are so easily created that they can be produced by individuals with criminal intent, even without substantial technical knowledge."" She warned law enforcement would need to develop ""new investigative methods and tools"" to address the emerging challenges. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) warns that more sexual abuse AI images of children are being produced and becoming more prevalent on the open web. In research last year the charity found that over a one-month period, 3,512 AI child sexual abuse and exploitation images were discovered on one dark website. Compared with a month in the previous year, the number of the most severe category images (Category A) had risen by 10%. Experts say AI child sexual abuse material can often look incredibly realistic, making it difficult to tell the real from the fake."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gg8le1kpo,Greeks hold mass protests demanding justice after train tragedy,2025-02-28T18:12:54.712Z,Kostas Koukoumakas,"Greeks have held their largest protests in years and took part in a general strike to mark the second anniversary of a rail disaster that left 57 dead and dozens more injured. In the centre of Athens alone the crowd was put at hundreds of thousands, and big numbers were seen in Thessaloniki, Larissa and Ioannina, as well as many other cities. ""For those of us who had children on that train, a part of our soul remained there and will never return,"" said Maria Karystianou, the head of the Tempi victims' association, whose daughter Marthi was among those killed in the tragedy. An inquiry concluded on Thursday that the accident was caused by human error, poor maintenance, and inadequate staffing. By early afternoon, a group of hooded men began to throw rocks and petrol bombs at police, marring the emotional atmosphere close to parliament. Police in riot gear responded with tear gas and water cannon as clashes went on for some time around the centre of the capital, in Ermou, Omonia and Propylaia. Dozens of people were arrested and the trouble flared up again as evening fell. The violence cast a shadow over the enormous scale of protests in virtually every city in Greece. ""I am here in memory of the people who were killed in the train crash. We demand justice,"" said 13-year-old Dimitris who had come with his father Petros Polyzos to the largest rally in Greece, in Syntagma Square in downtown Athens. It was during the night of 28 February 2023 that a passenger train packed with students collided head-on with a goods train near the Tempi gorge in central Greece. The report by Greece's Air and Rail Accident Investigation Authority warned that the safety failings exposed by the crash had not yet been addressed. ""Those children were killed because the train was not safe,"" said the authority's chief Christos Papadimitriou. The Tempi rail disaster shocked Greeks with many accusing their conservative government of doing too little to shed light on the causes of the tragedy. There is a widely held belief that the government has sought to cover up the role of high-ranking officials. The entire centre of Athens was crowded with people of all ages and all walks of life, with many saying they were attending a demonstration for the first time in their lives. Dmitris and his father were among many protesters in Athens, wearing t-shirts that read ""I have no oxygen - justice to the end"", referring to the 57 who died. Rallies were being organised in 346 cities, across Greece in Thessaloniki, Ioannina, Patras and Larissa, as well as in cities across Europe, including Brussels, Rome and several cities in the UK. The passenger service from Athens to Thessaloniki was crowded with students returning to university after a holiday for Greek Orthodox Lent when the train collided with a goods train on the same track outside Larisa. Seconds afterwards a fireball almost completely destroyed the first two carriages of the train. In Athens, protesters held placards reading ""My child, call me when you arrive"" and ""No cover-up"". What happened at the Tempi rail disaster? Dina Gazi, 62, held white balloons with the names of those who died in the accident. ""I firmly believe that the government is covering up those responsible for the accident"", she told BBC. ""We demand that all the evidence come to light."" Shops in the centre had their shutters down, many with messages of sympathy and support in their windows, and ordinary people did not go to work. Schools were closed, flights and trains cancelled, and the only public transport still operating was taking people to and from Syntagma Square. Taxi drivers promised to take people to the protest without charge. In a post on Facebook, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis said that everyone's thoughts were with the families of the 57 victims who died, as well as with the wounded and those who survived but carried the memory of that night. ""Nothing will ever be the same any more,"" he added, speaking of ""fatal human errors coupled with chronic shortcomings of the state"". In office for almost six years, this is the first time since Mitsotakis was elected that he has been in such a difficult political position. He promised to move ""more dynamically and quickly"" to bring about modern and safe trains. For Greeks this mass protest was unusual in that it was unrelated to the economy and their personal finances. Thursday's inquiry found that millions of euros had been paid out to cover the installation of safety systems along the railway, but that the project remained incomplete due to corruption and bureaucracy. Relatives of those killed in the crash believe the goods train may have been carrying contraband fuel on behalf of a smuggling ring. ""It is impossible to determine what exactly caused [the fireball], but simulations and expert reports indicate the possible presence of a hitherto unknown fuel,"" the report found. ""Serious information went missing because the site of the accident was not sealed,"" experts say, increasing public anger and heightening speculation of a cover-up. Government spokesperson Pavlos Marinakis denied there was a cover-up and said the allegation was not backed up by the report. Further allegations have surfaced suggesting orders were given to clear the crash site and ""landfill"" it days after the disaster, which meant that evidence disappeared. But Marinakis said the inquiry report concluded that no political directive was give to alter the scene. As he stood in the midst of Friday's protest in Syntagma Square, Pavlos Aslanidis spoke about the death of his 26-year-old son Dimitris in the Tempi accident. ""I don't know how I find the strength to stand,"" he told BBC. ""My son gives me the strength. Otherwise, I wouldn't be here today demanding justice."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5zzn81229o,Thirty-two people deported to Georgia on Irish chartered flight,2025-02-28T10:49:17.280Z,,"Thirty-two people were deported from the Republic of Ireland to Georgia on a chartered flight on Thursday night. It was the first operation conducted under a contract signed by the Republic last November for the provision of charter flights for deportations. All of those taken to Tbilisi on the flight were Georgian nationals who had been subject to deportation orders. The group was made up of 28 men, three women and a child who was with their parents. ""A central priority for me and this government is that our immigration laws are robust and enforced,"" Irish Justice Minister Jim O'Callaghan said. ""People are entitled to have confidence in our immigration system and there must be consequences for individuals who refuse to leave the state when they are ordered to do so."" He said Thursday's flight was ""a significant start in ensuring that deportation orders are enforced and part of a more effective immigration system generally. ""There will be further flights scheduled in the future."" Gardai (police), medical staff, an interpreter and a human rights observer were also onboard the flight. Mr O'Callaghan said when a person's application for asylum is refused or they are found to have no permission to be in the state, they are offered assistance to return home voluntarily. If they do not do so, they are liable to be deported by the Garda National Immigration Bureau, he added. The Irish Department of Justice said access to chartered flights ""has significantly increased the capacity of An Garda Síochána to effect removals"". Garda Commissioner Drew Harris said: ""Yesterday, the Garda National Immigration Bureau of An Garda Síochána, in a planned operation, carried out the removal of 32 persons from Ireland to Georgia. ""This was the largest removal operation carried out by GNIB in over six years. A ""An Garda Síochána continues to play its role in enforcing immigration legislation and maintaining the security and integrity of our borders."" Minister of State for Migration Colm Brophy said: ""Chartered deportation flights will now form an important part of removing people who do not have a right to remain in our country. ""I look forward to now seeing chartered flights in conjunction with voluntary deportations, ensuring that we will have a firm and effective system in place to deal with deportations going forward."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2yyrl0dj5o,Irish PM 'delighted' by Trump's White House invite,2025-02-28T22:46:01.438Z,,"The taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) has been invited to the White House by US President Donald Trump to celebrate St Patrick's Day next month. The meeting is scheduled to take place on 12 March, five days before the Irish public holiday. ""I have never met Donald Trump, but I am looking forward to meeting with him,"" Micheál Martin said on RTÉ's The Late Late Show on Friday night. ""We have to keep engaging with the United States,"" he said. The meeting is scheduled to take place on 12 March, five days before the Irish public holiday. Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported that Martin received the invitation in a letter from the US president. It said Trump's letter congratulated the taoiseach on his recent appointment and highlighted the special bond between the Irish and American people. During Friday night's Late Late Show, Martin also described a clash between the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and the US president as ""extraordinary"". The meeting ended early and a planned press conference was cancelled after the two leaders disagreed over the conflict between Ukraine and Russia. ""This has been a huge unsettling setback today, there's no question about that,"" Martin said. Martin and Zelensky met at Shannon Airport in County Clare on Thursday, where Martin said that Ireland is committed to helping Ukraine financially. It is customary for Irish leaders to travel to the US every March for an audience with the president at the White House. They present their host with a bowl of shamrock - a tradition that dates back to President Harry Truman in 1952. Martin is serving his second term as taoiseach, having previously led his country from June 2020 to December 2022. However, he was not able to visit the White House on St Patrick's Day in 2021 because of Covid travel restrictions. He did make the trip to Washington DC in March 2022 but he could not visit the White House in person because he contracted Covid while in the US. As a result, Martin's previous St Patrick's Day duties as taoiseach consisted of video calls with Trump's predecessor Joe Biden. The annual Washington visit is viewed as an important political opportunity to strengthen US and Irish diplomatic relations and boost cross-Atlantic trade. The Republic of Ireland is particularly vulnerable to threats of US tariffs on European imports and Trump's ""America First"" policy. In 2023, the US was the number-one country for Irish goods exports, buying products worth €54bn. That meant just over a quarter of Irish goods exports were sold into this one market. Earlier this week, Trump said he was planning to impose tariffs of about 25% on goods made in the European Union, of which Ireland is member. On Thursday, the Tánaiste (deputy PM) Simon Harris told the Dáil (Irish Parliament) it has never been a more important time for ministers to travel abroad for talks. Almost 40 Irish ministers and other state officials will make St Patrick's Day trips to destinations including the US, Australia, Japan, India, Mexico and Thailand. Visiting Trump in the White House can also have political perils at home, however, because of his controversial foreign policy announcements. In Northern Ireland, Sinn Féin and the Social Democratic and Labour Party (SDLP) said they would boycott the White House this St Patrick's Day because of Trump's stance on the Israel-Gaza conflict. The Alliance Party has also confirmed they will not attend the events, but Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Emma Little-Pengelly is going to Washington DC. Asked about her plans, Little-Pengelly said it was important to ""maintain long and rewarding"" relationships with the US. ""It's important we engage regardless of what our personal views may or may not be. That's what I'll be doing on St Patrick's Day,"" she added."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd655917g6qo,"Pope has 'peaceful night' after breathing crisis, Vatican says",2025-03-01T12:03:21.010Z,Sarah Rainsford Thomas Mackintosh,"Pope Francis, who has been battling pneumonia for two weeks, has had an ""isolated"" breathing crisis in hospital, the Vatican has said. It led to an episode of vomiting and a ""sudden worsening of his respiratory condition"" on Friday following the coughing ""bronchospasm"". The 88-year-old received gas through a face mask to help him breathe. In an update on Saturday, the Vatican said the Pope had a ""peaceful night and is resting"". A Vatican official added: ""I think he had coffee this morning."" Earlier, Vatican sources said the Pope's doctors needed 24 to 48 hours to determine whether there had been any damage or setback to his overall condition. They were not giving any prognosis, but said the Pope remained alert and ""in good spirits"". In a statement on Friday, the Vatican said: ""In the early afternoon of today, after a morning spent alternating respiratory physiotherapy with prayer in the chapel, the Holy Father presented an isolated crisis of bronchospasm which, however, led to an episode of vomiting with inhalation and sudden worsening of the respiratory condition. ""The Holy Father was promptly bronchoaspirated and began non-invasive mechanical ventilation, with a good response to gas exchange."" Vatican sources said the latest crisis happened at about 14:00 local time on Friday, but did not say how long it lasted. The latest episode comes after a couple of days in which Vatican statements had been slightly more positive, talking of a ""slight improvement"" in the pontiff's condition. He was given Communion on Friday morning. In an earlier medical update, the Vatican stressed that the Pope would remain in Rome's Gemelli Hospital because of the ""complex"" clinical picture. The level of detail from Vatican officials about the Pope's latest crisis is extraordinary. This is now the longest the Pope has been in hospital – and the longest period in which he's been out of public sight – since he took over from Pope Benedict in 2013. That makes many Roman Catholics nervous. Previously, Italian TV channels were reporting that the Pope was ""no longer critical"", as that word disappeared from Vatican health updates recently and the Pope's health slipped down the news agenda. Now it's back on the front pages, although news of the Ukrainian president's brutal dressing down in the Oval Office is the biggest story. ""Another crisis, Anxiety for the Pope"" is today's headline for Il Messaggero, which also speaks of ""prayers and tears"" among Catholics gathered for evening prayers outside St Peter's Basilica. ""Vomit and breathing crisis: Anxiety for the Pope returns"" is the headline in Il Giornale. The Pope was admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days. He was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. Then, on 22 February, the Vatican said that the Pope had experienced a respiratory crisis and was in a ""critical"" condition, but later on Sunday released an update saying that he had ""not presented any further respiratory crises"". The following day, the Pope issued a statement asking Catholics to pray for him after he was unable to deliver the traditional Angelus prayer in person for the second week running. But, while the Vatican said the Pope's health is improving, it added that ""further days of clinical stability are necessary to resolve the prognosis"". The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy – an inflammation of the lungs – as a young man and had a partial lung removal. The leader of the Roman Catholic Church has been admitted to hospital multiple times during his 12-year tenure, including being treated for bronchitis at the same hospital in March 2023. From Argentina, Pope Francis is the first Latin American, and first Jesuit, to lead the Roman Catholic Church."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cge11q4xwr3o,"Brutally beaten man 'cannot walk, talk or breathe for himself'",2025-02-28T06:20:52.351Z,Keiron Tourish,"The girlfriend of a man, who is fighting for his life in hospital after being savagely beaten, says he cannot walk, talk or breathe for himself and will never be the same again. Charles Dooher, a 26-year-old farmer from Lifford in County Donegal, was at home when a masked gang beat him with iron bars and other weapons on 20 January. Charlotte Gallen said it is heartbreaking to see her partner clinging to life. They had dreams of getting married and having children but now, she says, the future looks uncertain. He suffered severe head injuries in the attack and is on life support in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast. His father, also named Charles, was assaulted too. His girlfriend of five years, Ms Gallen, described it as a ""a brutal and vicious attack"". ""I feel that it was targeted and organised and they entered the home armed with weapons. They beat him on the back of the head. ""They actually cable tied his sister and threw her in her bedroom. And they also beat his father too and left him with injuries."" Warning: Contains distressing details She told BBC News NI her boyfriend has a severe traumatic brain injury. ""He actually has one of the worst head injuries that the top neurosurgeons and doctors in the Royal had ever seen,"" she said. ""He's left without half of his skull and he has life-changing injuries that are going to affect him for the rest of his life,"" she added. ""Can you imagine seeing man of his build who has always been strong and capable of doing anything he has put his mind to laying in a bed having to be peg fed (using a feeding tube) because he can't swallow and is not able to walk, he can't talk, he can't do anything, he can't even breathe for himself. ""You are seeing a man that's so strong and provides you with safety and comfort laying in such a vulnerable position."" She wants people to think about how they would feel in this situation if it was one of their loved ones. ""Somebody, somewhere knows something,"" she said. She urged anyone with any information to consider sharing it. The Dooher family was critical of the Garda (Irish police) investigation into the attack at their home outside Lifford. They claim they had been subjected to various threats over the years and robust action was not taken. A spokesperson for the Gardai said: ""An Garda Siochána does not comment on the detail of interactions with families. And Garda Siochána will continue to liaise with the family."" A family statement, from solicitor Ciaran Shiels, said the family was ""a close, hard-working, law abiding family with respect for the law"". Charles Dooher's sister Deborah, a nurse, says those responsible should be ashamed of themselves. She believes there has been an ""an exchange of money"" involved in the attack. ""They went to Charles' room as he was getting ready to go to the gym and delivered several deadly blows to the back of his skull fracturing it, to the extent that you drop a porcelain plate on the floor."" She said that, even as a medical professional, the extent of his injuries have been shocking. Deborah said her brother is in ""constant severe pain"". ""I think somebody would have to absolutely hate my brother and want him dead to cause that extent of injury. ""As a nurse I've seen a lot of people in a lot of pain. I've seen people fight cancer. I've seen families in a lot of pain. ""Usually it's because someone has been sick and usually it's because of a normal or somewhat normal circumstance."" Charlotte Gallen says she and Charles had planned on getting married and having children but those dreams now appear to be shattered by this horrendous attack, she believes. ""The plans we'd made they seem so far away. We may never get to do the things that we dreamed of doing together."" Ms Gallen has been by his bedside since the attack. ""I've been praying endlessly for him to make a full recovery physically and psychologically. It's just been traumatising and I don't think any of us will recover from this."" She said that the perpetrators are ""callous and evil"". ""He's an innocent man. He's an honest working man. I think they have a lot to think about when they go to sleep at night."" Gardaí said their investigation is continuing and renewed their appeal for any witnesses to come forward. Officers are especially keen for anyone who may have dash cam footage of a silver or grey Peugeot 3008 car seen in the Coneyburrow Road area of Lifford between 10:00 and 11:00 local time on 20 January to contact them, a Garda spokesperson said."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly7yxm3py5o,Can AI help modernise Ireland's healthcare system?,2025-02-28T00:06:40.724Z,Padraig Belton,"For a country famous as Big Tech's European address, Ireland's hospitals often lag far behind in technology. They lack shared computerised patient records, or unique identifiers to track people when they move between clinics. In July 2024, a computer system failure made Dublin's Mater hospital push back surgeries and beg people not to come to its A&E. Three years before, Russian ransomware attackers shut down the Irish health system's entire computer network, and published 520 people's medical records online. But Ireland now has ambitious goals to modernise its healthcare. That includes a programme called Sláintecare. Announced in 2017, the plan is to use some of its €22.9bn (£20bn; $24bn) budget surplus to create a healthcare service that is free at the point of care, like the UK's or Canada's. To improve healthcare, pinch points like diagnostics will have to be improved. It's a problem being tackled at Dublin's Mater hospital, 164-years-old and the location of Ireland's busiest emergency department. That's especially so in winter, when one day early this January Irish A&E departments had 444 people on trolleys waiting to be seen. ""In Ireland, the big problem we have is waiting lists, and in particular waiting for diagnostics, for MRI [magnetic resonance imaging] or CT [computed tomography] scans,"" says Prof Peter McMahon, a consultant radiologist at the Mater. Because of Prof MacMahon, who as a medical student dabbled as a hobbyist programmer, the Mater is now among the first hospitals in Ireland to use artificial intelligence (AI) across its radiology department - the part of a hospital providing medical imaging to diagnose diseases and guide treatment. To make sure patients with the most urgent needs are seen first, Prof MacMahon says: ""We use AI to immediately analyse all head scans for bleeds, all chest scans for blood clots, and all bone x-rays for fractures."" The AI is particularly helpful in assisting younger doctors, when they don't have experienced consultants to turn to. ""Now a nurse or junior doctor at 2am isn't alone, they've got a wing man,"" he says. Rural hospitals face different kinds of challenges. Letterkenny University Hospital in Donegal is without MRI facilities at evenings and weekends. Currently, a patient urgently needing an MRI scan at night can face an ambulance ride to Dublin. But now, Prof MacMahon and the Mater's AI research fellow Paul Banahan have trained a trial AI model to create a ""synthetic MRI"" from CT scans, to immediately triage patients with suspected spinal injuries. That was done by feeding a ""generative AI"" model around 9,500 pairs of CT and MRI images of the same area on the same person. Now the AI can predict what the MRI scan would look like from the CT scan, something available in all emergency departments. And since radiology scans also come with doctors' text reports, he is also exploring using large language models to identify important disease patterns and trends. Applying AI to medical images in Ireland is easier since the country has stored scans in a central, digital filing system since 2008. But a lot of other important information, like medical notes or electrocardiograms (ECGs), remains largely in paper format in most Irish hospitals, or in smaller databases that are not shared centrally. That will ""severely delay"" applying AI to spot potential diseases and improve clinical care, points out Prof MacMahon. Ageing IT systems in Irish healthcare are more broadly a challenge. ""Quite bluntly, a lot of hospitals are dealing with legacy IT systems where they're just trying to keep the show on the road,"" says Dr Robert Ross, a senior computer science lecturer at Technological University Dublin. ""Doing anything else like integrating AI is not easy to do,"" he says. Using AI in healthcare is not without problems. An example here is AI speech-recognition tools. Using them could let doctors spend less time on note-taking and report writing. But some have been found to make things up, including to invent non-existent medication. To prevent such AI from hallucinating, ""you need to make sure it's penalised in its training, if it gives you something that doesn't exist,"" says Prof MacMahon. AIs can have biases, but ""humans have biases too"", he points out. A tired doctor, expecting a young patient to be healthy, can overlook their blood clot. ""For whatever reason we're far more open to accept human error"", than in new health technology where ""the acceptable risk is zero"", says Prof Seán Kennelly, a consultant at Tallaght University Hospital and professor at Trinity College Dublin. This means we ""continue with the illusion of 100% accuracy in humans"", and ignore areas where AI-supported technology can make better clinical decisions, he says. Healthcare regulators, who already have a ""weak enough"" understanding of software as a medical device, haven't at all caught up with rules for AI, says Dr Aidan Boran, founder of an Irish medical tech start-up called Digital Gait Labs, and a researcher at Dublin City University. For example, getting a CE mark, which shows that a medical device meets EU safety regulations, includes providing details about the factory where the product is manufactured. But in the case of software that is not relevant says Dr Boran. ""For us, manufacturing literally means copying software,"" he points out. AI can have a black box problem: we can see what goes in them and what comes out, but the deep learning systems that power these models are so complex that even their creators do not understand exactly what happens inside them. That can create difficulties for a doctor trying to explain treatment decisions that involve AI, says Dr Paul Gilligan, head of St Patrick's Mental Health Services, one of Ireland's largest mental health providers that runs St Patrick's Hospital in Dublin. When AI influences their decisions, doctors need to ""be able to articulate the reasoning behind those decisions in a manner that is accessible and understandable to those affected,"" he says."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq222rqv4po,Tate brothers arrive in US after Romania prosecutors lift travel ban,2025-02-27T21:19:11.619Z,"Nick Thorpe, Mircea Barbu & Paul Kirby","British-American influencers Andrew and Tristan Tate - who are facing trial in Romania on charges including human trafficking - have arrived in the US after Romanian prosecutors lifted a two-year travel ban. Andrew, 38, and his brother Tristan, 36, have strongly denied the allegations against them. The two departed Bucharest on a private jet early on Thursday and arrived in Florida hours later, with Andrew telling reporters they are ""misunderstood"". Romanian prosecutors stressed the case against them had not been dropped and that they remain ""under judicial control"" - meaning they have to regularly report to authorities and are expected to return to Romania. However their exit has sparked concerns that prosecutors felt political pressure from the Trump administration. The US president said he knew nothing about the Tate brothers being released from Romania. The Tate brothers are accused of human trafficking and forming an organised group to sexually exploit women in Romania. Andrew Tate is also accused of rape. In the US they also face a civil case from a woman who alleges the brothers coerced her into sex work, and then defamed her after she gave evidence to Romanian authorities. The brothers also face separate charges in the UK of rape and human trafficking. They deny all the allegations against them. Upon arrival, Andrew Tate told reporters: ""We live in a democratic society where it's innocent until proven guilty and I think my brother and I are largely misunderstood."" ""There's a lot of opinions about us, a lot of things that got around about us on the internet,"" he said, adding that they are ""yet to be convicted of any crime in our lives ever"". The brothers declined to answer questions about their release and Trump's role in them being allowed into the US. A lawyer for the Tate brothers, Joseph McBride, said they will return to Romania at the end of March to meet the prosecutor before returning to the US. ""They feel secure in America for several reasons, the primary one being that Donald Trump is the president. As a result, they are excited to call America their home again,"" Mr McBride said in a statement. Speaking in the White House after their plane landed, Trump said he knew nothing about the Tate brothers being released from Romania. Asked if his administration pressured the Romanian government to release them, he said: ""I know nothing about that. I don't know, you're saying he's on a plane right now?"" UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was sitting next to Trump in the White House, said: ""There's an English element here, so obviously it's important justice is done, and human trafficking is obviously, to my mind, a security risk."" On Thursday, the brothers arrived at Fort Lauderdale in Florida around 11:00 local time (16:00 GMT) and were seen disembarking the aircraft. Their arrival follows comments made by Trump administration figures earlier this month. The Tates have regularly posted messages in support of Trump, and Tristan Tate has said his brother's role in persuading ""millions of young men"" to back him ""cannot be overlooked"". Romania's Foreign Minister has also told Romanian TV that Trump's envoy for special missions had raised the brothers during a conversation at the Munich Security Conference in Germany a fortnight ago. Emil Hurezeanu said his discussion with Richard Grenell had been informal and he did not consider the approach ""a form of pressure"". Grenell told the Financial Times his support for the brothers was evident from his ""publicly available tweets"". However, women who have brought sexual abuse allegations against the Tate brothers said last week they were ""extremely concerned"" by reports that US officials had asked Romania to relax travel restrictions for the men. Andrew Tate is a self-described misogynist who has attracted millions of followers online, despite being previously banned from social media platforms for expressing his views. He and his brother were first arrested in Romania in December 2022, with Andrew accused of rape and human trafficking and Tristan suspected of human trafficking. They both denied the charges and spent several months under house arrest. A year later, in August 2024, they faced new allegations including sex with a minor and trafficking underage persons, all of which they deny. A former kickboxer who had appeared on UK TV show Big Brother, Andrew had moved from the UK to Romania several years ago. However police in Bedfordshire are still seeking his extradition on separate and unrelated allegations of rape and human trafficking, as well as tax evasion. In the UK, four British women have filed a civil case against Andrew Tate in the UK High Court, alleging that he raped and coercively controlled them. Tate denies all the allegations against him. Those plaintiffs said it was clear he would not face criminal prosecution in Romania and appealed to UK authorities to take action. ""We are in disbelief and feel re-traumatised by the news that the Romanian authorities have given into pressure from the Trump administration to allow Andrew Tate to travel around Europe and to the US,"" the women said in a statement. Elena Lasconi, who is running for the Romanian presidency in May's elections, six months after they were controversially cancelled, has called for the immediate resignation of the head of Romania's organised crime investigations directorate DIICOT, which made the decision to let the brothers leave. ""I am outraged!"" she wrote on social media, ""as a woman, a human being and a Romanian."" Lasconi said prosecutors should explain publicly whether their decision had come as a result of external pressure. Prosecutors from DIICOT have emphasised that the judicial conditions for the brothers have not changed. Any violation of those obligations made in bad faith ""may lead to the replacement of judicial control with a higher measure of deprivation of liberty"", it said in a statement in Romanian. Following a successful court appeal on Wednesday, the brothers also had multiple assets returned to them which had originally been seized by authorities - including six properties, six cars, and frozen bank accounts. This comes after court limitations were ""modified in order to allow the brothers to travel to the USA,"" the statement from the Tates' representative said. The Tates are understood to be required to return to Bucharest at the end of March to satisfy the prosecutors' terms, however it is too early to say whether they will comply with them. Romania is both a member of the European Union and a key Nato member state on the Western alliance's eastern flank. It has an extradition treaty with the US. Senior Trump figures have also had the government in Bucharest in their sights over the court ruling that annulled last December's presidential election. Romanian intelligence services said far-right candidate Calin Georgescu had been supported by a flurry of TikTok accounts engineered by Russia. Georgescu was indicted on Wednesday for attempted ""incitement to acts against the constitutional order"". He has denied any wrongdoing and has previously called the election annulment a ""formalised coup d'etat"". Prosecutors are still investigating the allegations of election fraud."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy833v895e1o,Man found guilty of murder of woman in Dublin,2025-02-27T20:36:29.156Z,,"A 40-year-old man has been found guilty of the murder of a mother-of two in her home in Ballymun in Dublin in May 2022. Brian McHugh of Cairn Court, Poppintree in Ballymun, had pleaded not guilty to murdering Lisa Thompson, 52, at the house in Sandyhill Gardens, in Dublin. She had been stabbed 11 times in the chest and strangled with a blind cord. A forensic scientist told the Central Criminal Court trial that McHugh's DNA was found on the cord. When asked about the presence of his DNA on the cord, McHugh told gardai that he had been ""in and out"" of Ms Thompson's house ""for the last three years"". The trial also heard evidence that Ms Thompson had been dealing prescription drugs from her home and that she had been in a brief relationship with McHugh. The prosecution argued that McHugh was seen on CCTV in the early hours of the morning of 9 May near Ms Thompson's house. Defence counsel for McHugh submitted that this was not ""the neat case wrapped up in a bow"" which the prosecution had presented to the jury. The 12 jurors took three hours and 24 minutes to unanimously reject McHugh's defence. The judge, Ms Justice Karen O'Connor, offered her ""sincere condolences"" to the Thompson family and thanked them for their dignity throughout the case. ""I cannot imagine your pain and what you have suffered in terms of your grief,"" she said. McHugh will be sentenced to the mandatory term of life in prison on 10 March. On that date, the Thompson family will have an opportunity to make a statement to the court about the impact Lisa's death has had on their lives."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kggxm6gevo,Dáil speaking rights protest branded 'childish',2025-02-27T18:05:27.027Z,,"Irish opposition parties have been branded ""childish"" by the tánaiste (Irish deputy prime minister) after they announced protest action over a long-running row on speaking rights at the Irish parliament. The issue, sparked in January when Ireland's newly-formed coalition government attempted to be formally elected, centres on independent members of the government getting dedicated time in parliament to hold ministers to account. On Thursday, a Dáil (Irish parliament) reform committee voted to allow new speaking slots for those independent members who support the government. However, opposition parties labelled the meeting as ""disgraceful"". The parties - including Sinn Féin, Labour, the Social Democrats, People Before Profit and Independent Ireland - have announced they will withdraw from pairing arrangements in protest. The speaking rights plan has to be voted through the Dáil before it can proceed but will have sufficient support thanks to the government majority. Pairing is a process where a parliament member of a party abstains from a vote if the member of an opposition party cannot attend. The withdrawal of pairing would negatively affect government business in March when most ministers travel abroad for St Patrick's Day engagements. Almost 40 ministers, junior ministers and other state officials have trips organised to destinations including the US, Australia, Japan, India, Mexico and Thailand. Tánaiste Simon Harris told the Dáil it has never been more important for ministers to travel abroad for discussions, but the withdrawal of pairings will now prevent this. He also defended the government's speaking rights plan, arguing that all Dáil members should be allowed ask questions on behalf of their constituents. But he faced pointed questions from opposition members about what kind of deal the government had done with independents in order to secure their support. The government is seeking to push through a plan to introduce extra speaking time slots in the Dáil for independents who want to question the country's leaders. Some of those independents supported and even helped to negotiate the current programme for government. However, they now want dedicated Dáil time to hold ministers to account, something that opposition parties argue would undermine democracy. The row has been rumbling since January, when loud protests from opposition parties led to turbulent scenes in the Dáil, which had to be repeatedly adjourned. The protests resulted in a one-day delay to the re-election of Micheál Martin as taoiseach (Irish prime minister). In early February, the Ceann Comhairle (parliament speaker) ruled the initial plan - which would have seen those independents treated as part of the opposition for the purposes of speaking time - could not proceed. On Wednesday, the Dáil Reform Committee voted to approve a plan that would see the creation of new question time slots for independent members. Irish national broadcaster RTÉ reported that the government defended the plan in a two-page document circulated to the Dáil Reform Committee, which started a ""modern parliament is not necessarily made up of 'government' and 'opposition' members"". It added ""there are members who can't readily be categorised as such,"" referring to independents who support the government but do not have ministerial posts. It has also said the plan would mean independents have their own speaking time that would not take away from opposition speaking time rights. If voted through, the plan would mean about 60 Dáil members would be allowed to question the taoiseach and the tánaiste on a weekly basis. Harris argued on Thursday that all TDs (Irish parliament members) should be allowed to ask questions on behalf of their constituents and he vowed to defend that right. However opposition parties have been highly critical - in a joint statement they said it was ""another cynical attempt to manipulate speaking time in order to grant special privileges to TDs who were part of negotiating the programme for government and clearly and unambiguously support the government"". Sinn Féin's Matt Carthy said the government was plunging the Dáil into chaos while Labour TD Duncan Smith said the government were ""defending the indefensible"". Martin's Fianna Fáil party won the most seats in November's general election but not enough to form a government on their own. It entered a coalition with Fine Gael and several independents to gain a majority, but some of those independents sought to form a ""technical group"" that would have seen them afforded speaking time and other rights from the opposition benches."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyjj9lv5qvo,Murder trial judge tells jury to 'proceed with caution',2025-02-27T17:55:40.999Z,,"Jurors in the trial of two people accused of the murder of 66-year-old Robert Wilkin have been warned it could be dangerous to act on some of the testimony of one of the co-accused. Alan Vial, 39, of Drumanoo Head, Killybegs, County Donegal, and Nikita Burns, 23, from An Charraig, County Donegal, both deny the murder of Robert Wilkin, who was also known as Robin, on 25 June 2023. The body of the County Tyrone man was found in the sea at the foot of Slieve League cliffs in County Donegal in the Republic of Ireland. On Thursday, Mr Justice Paul McDermott urged the jury to ""proceed with caution"" in respect of Mr Vial's evidence ""in respect of his implication of Ms Burns."" During the trial Mr Vial claimed it was his former lover and co-accused Ms Burns who beat Mr Wilkin to death with a rock and helped put his body over Ireland's tallest cliffs. He insisted he was telling the truth when he said that Ms Burns caused Mr Wilkin's death by twice striking him on the back of the head with a rock and that he did not strike him at all. It is the prosecution case that Mr Vial and Ms Burns were part of a joint enterprise to cause serious harm to Mr Wilkin before putting him over the cliffs. In a statement to Gardai ( Irish police), Ms Burns denied striking Mr Wilkin and described a fight in which her co-accused hit the deceased six or seven times with a rock. She also denied helping to put the body over the cliff but accepted that she had helped to clean Mr Wilkin's blood from the car. Mr Justice McDermott told the jury at the Central Criminal Court in Dublin that Ms Burns' statements to Gardai or others outside court cannot be used as evidence against Mr Vial. However, Mr Vial's court testimony, which was subject to cross examination by Ms Burns' lawyers, can be used as evidence against her. The judge added: ""You have to proceed with caution when considering his evidence in respect of his implication of Ms Burns, because there is a danger that a co-accused, in his position, on the same charge of murder, may fabricate evidence or falsely implicate their co-accused."" While the jury can rely on Mr Vial's testimony if they accept it, Mr Justice McDermott said it is ""dangerous to act on it"" where it is uncorroborated by other evidence. ""You are not precluded from acting on it,"" he said, ""but you must bear in mind the warning I have given you in respect of doing so."" Jurors were told where the prosecution alleges a joint enterprise murder, it must prove that both accused entered a tacit or explicit agreement to kill or cause serious injury to Mr Wilkin. If they both acted in pursuit of that joint goal, the prosecution does not have to establish which of the two inflicted the fatal blows. However, if the prosecution has failed to prove the joint enterprise beyond a reasonable doubt, jurors were told, they must consider each accused's individual responsibility. In particular, they must consider whether the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt whether either accused killed Mr Wilkin with the necessary intent for murder. The judge further told the jury that in relation to each accused, they can return a verdict of not guilty of murder but guilty of impeding the apprehension of another person for murder. That would arise, he said, in a situation where they were satisfied that one of the accused is guilty of murder but the case against the other is unproven. Mr Justice McDermott has begun a reprise of the evidence heard during the trial, which began on 17 January. The jury is not available on Friday or Monday and will return next Tuesday."

They met at Shannon Airport in County Clare on Thursday. Martin cancelled a planned visit to Stormont in order to attend the meeting. He told Zelensky that he has to look at ""alternative approaches to give financial aid to Ukraine"". ""Our commitments... have been frustrated by Hungary's decision to veto the deployment of the European peace facility fund set up by the European union,"" he explained. Zelensky is due to meet US President Donald Trump in Washington on Friday to sign an agreement on sharing his country's mineral resources. He made a brief stop at the Irish airport on the way to this meeting. ""We discussed issues around a sustainable and durable peace settlement,"" Martin said. ""We made it clear that we would push very strongly for an accelerated timeline in terms of Ukrainian membership of the European Union,"" he said. He said Zelensky ""was very thankful... for Ireland's sustained support for the Ukrainian people... as they battle through this terrible war"". He said Ireland could help by taking part in initiatives to help feed children in Ukraine and is looking into supporting financially the use of robotic drones to help bring back soldiers who are injured. Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported that Zelensky said he was delighted to be in Ireland and to meet with the Taoiseach. He thanked the Irish people for the support they have offered Ukrainian citizens who have been forced to flee from conflict. At the end of 2024 almost 80,000 Ukrainian refugees were still living in the Republic of Ireland, according to Ireland's Central Statistics Office. Earlier this week, Ireland pledged to increase financial humanitarian aid to Ukraine. Martin said that Ireland would ""contribute more financially on all fronts and in all areas""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0q1188p1n2o,Austrian centrists agree government deal sidelining far right,2025-02-27T14:07:08.796Z,Bethany Bell,"Five months after the far-right Freedom Party won Austria's general election, a three-way coalition looks set to exclude it from power. The conservative People's Party (ÖVP), the Social Democrats (SPÖ), and the liberal Neos say they have successfully completed negotiations to form a new administration - a record 151 days since the election was held in September. The leader of the Eurosceptic, Russia-friendly Freedom Party (FPÖ), Herbert Kickl, called the tie-up a coalition of ""losers"" and called for a snap election. Thursday's announcement follows the longest period of coalition negotiations in Austria's recent history, after two previous attempts to form a government failed. The three-party government, which would be the first since the late 1940s, is due to take office next week, if all the parties approve the deal. The biggest hurdle is a vote at a Neos party meeting on Sunday, where a two-thirds majority is needed. The new chancellor will be Christian Stocker of the ÖVP. As he presented the new government programme with the leader of the SPÖ, Andreas Babler, and the Neos, Beate Meinl-Reisinger, Stocker said the negotiations had been ""perhaps the most difficult in the history of our country"". But he said they had achieved ""a breakthrough"" that wasn't ""a minimal compromise"". The three parties set out plans to avoid facing a European Union procedure for running an excess budget deficit, with measures including an increased levy on banks. The programme also includes tougher asylum measures, including a temporary stop for family reunifications. Stocker said there would be ""an integration year for refugees"" from day one of their arrival in Austria. The three parties also said they reserved the right to impose an asylum freeze, if numbers of applications increased. They are also planning a headscarf ban for girls under 15. The programme also emphasised that the government was ""committed to a strong and better European Union"". In a post on social media, Kickl said: ""I don't think this has ever happened before: a so-called 'government programme' before a government has even been formed."" Despite the FPÖ's unprecedented victory, topping the polls for the first time, Austria's President Alexander Van der Bellen first gave the ÖVP the mandate to form a government. At the time, the leaders of all of the other parties ruled out making an alliance with Herbert Kickl. However, the ÖVP's first attempt to forge a coalition with the Social Democrats and Neos failed at the beginning of January. On 6 January, Van der Bellen gave Kickl the mandate to form a government. But a few weeks later, the Freedom Party's talks with the conservatives also broke down, partly due to disputes over minister posts. Political analyst Thomas Hofer told the BBC that there had been ""no base of trust"" between the two parties. The ÖVP, the Social Democrats and Neos then started a second round of negotiations, which culminated in an agreement. Thomas Hofer says their new alliance faces challenges. ""This is of course an emergency cabinet. It had to be built quickly and one can see that looking at the programme, The main message is that they are not Herbert Kickl, but that message will not last very long. They will have to negotiate more along the way."" Hofer says the parties ""even have to guarantee inner party stability"", and that their popularity could grow if they tackle ""the massive problems ahead, but those problems are also a chance for the FPÖ"", which he said had flourished in opposition. According to opinion polls, a new election would see further gains for the Freedom Party."
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-59667938,Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky: The comedian who became a wartime leader,2025-03-01T09:33:25.000Z,Stephen Mulvey & James Gregory,"Volodymyr Oleksandrovych Zelensky was a comedian with no political experience when he announced that he would be running in Ukraine's 2019 presidential election. Six years later, he is an embattled wartime leader navigating a huge geopolitical upheaval as Donald Trump brings to an end years of strong American support for Ukraine. Zelensky has been a symbol of Ukrainian defiance against Russian aggression. Slava Ukraini, or Glory to Ukraine, has been his battle cry since Moscow launched its full-scale invasion on 24 February 2022. Much of the world rallied behind him - he received several standing ovations after his address to the US Congress asking for American support. But just three years later, he finds himself in uncertain territory, with US President Donald Trump calling him a dictator and the US siding with Russia in votes at the UN to mark the third anniversary of the Ukraine war. Zelensky's trip to Washington at the end of February, during which he was expected to sign an agreement on sharing his country's mineral resources with the US, ended in acrimony. He was told to leave the White House after an angry exchange with Trump and his vice-president, JD Vance. Zelensky's arrival on the political scene was a case of life imitating art. Ironically, Zelensky's most celebrated role as a comic actor was playing a school teacher who was catapulted into the presidency on the TV series, Servant of the People. Cut to real life, and his election candidacy, aged 41, was initially seen by some as a joke - his political party is even called Servant of the People. But he won with a landslide 73% of the vote, promising to fight corruption and bring peace in the east of Ukraine. Sceptics feared Zelensky would turn out to be a puppet leader, controlled by oligarch Ihor Kolomoisky who backed his campaign and had been under investigation for fraud and money laundering. But Zelensky proved to be more independent than his doubters thought, and the anti-corruption drive by his administration has had some success. Many Ukrainians also viewed Zelensky's rhetoric on the conflict in the eastern Donbas region and relations with Russia as too timid, says communications consultant Yaryna Klyuchkovska. As the drumbeat of war grew louder, Zelensky continued to emphasise his hopes for a diplomatic solution, even while Ukraine was reporting a rapid increase in ceasefire violations along the front line. His attempts to negotiate with Russia had only limited success. There were prisoner exchanges and moves towards implementing parts of a peace process, known as the Minsk agreements, but no breakthrough. Throughout 2020 his approval rating steadily fell. There was a notable shift in tone at the Munich Security Conference in February 2022, when Zelensky laid bare the threat his country was facing, and accused the West of appeasing a resurgent Russia. No Ukrainian leader had spoken so bluntly to the West before, according to Ms Klyuchkovska. Then, on 24 February 2022 - just hours before Russia first began bombarding Ukraine's cities - came a key moment. In a sober address posted on social media, speaking partly in Russian, Zelensky said he had tried to call Vladimir Putin to avert a war, and had been met by silence. The two countries didn't need a war, he said, but if Ukrainians came under attack they would defend themselves. ""When you attack us you will see our faces - not our backs, but our faces."" For his next broadcast after Russia had invaded, he wore military fatigues, reflecting the country's David-versus-Goliath struggle. That evening he made another address, warning Western leaders that if they did not help, tomorrow ""war will knock on your doors"". Zelensky's nightly video addresses became a source of hope and comfort for millions of Ukrainians during the ongoing fighting. His ability to connect was perhaps most evident when he posted a defiant video of himself with several top advisers in Kyiv, after Russia falsely claimed he had fled the capital. ""We are here,"" he repeated. ""We are in Kyiv. We are protecting Ukraine."" Zelensky quickly became a national figurehead, with a high of 90% approval ratings in the immediate aftermath of the invasion. The war has understandably taken an emotional toll on Zelensky's family. His wife, Olena Zelenska, and their two children spent months living in secret locations for their own safety. The four have spent very little time together since the start of the conflict. Further afield, Zelensky has seen it as his mission to galvanise support for Ukraine, leaning on his western allies to provide aid and fast-track his country's membership of Nato. In between visits to the front line, he has spoken with foreign leaders to lobby support and attended conferences across the globe, pleading for help. One of the most striking and enduring images from the early months of the war was his visit in April 2022 to the outer Kyiv suburb town of Bucha - where Russian troops are suspected of committing hundreds of war crimes. His first foreign trip after the invasion came in December 2022 when he went to the US to visit then-President Joe Biden - unsurprising given Washington had been Kyiv's largest backer. During that trip, Zelensky received several standing ovations when he addressed Congress and told them: ""Against all odds... Ukraine is alive and kicking"" and will ""never surrender"". Biden also promised further support to Ukraine, saying the American people were prepared to ""have us stand up to bullies"". But Zelensky has cut a frustrated figure at times over the speed at which he has received western support - as well as the reluctance to approve the use of some weapons on the front line. Even in the first few months of the conflict, it was clear there would be pushback from some Republican Party quarters over how much support the US should give. Three years on, and with a different president in the White House, there appears to be a deepening rift between the two countries. Zelensky has long maintained that talks about Ukraine's future should be conducted with Ukraine at the table. But the Americans have instead met with Russian officials to discuss the war - and Ukraine wasn't there. Zelensky has accused the US of helping Putin to ""break out of years of isolation"" and said Donald Trump lives in a ""Russian disinformation space"". Meanwhile, Trump has turned his ire on Zelensky, calling him a ""dictator"" - echoing Russia's claims - and criticising the fact that Ukraine has not held an election since 2019. A vote was scheduled for May 2024, but it was suspended because Ukraine has been under martial law since the invasion began, a decision that was broadly backed by the opposition and the Ukrainian population. Zelensky has suggested he would be willing to resign as leader in return for Ukraine's membership of Nato. Trump also took aim at Zelensky's approval rating. It is true that his popularity has dipped over the years, but as Yaryna Klyuchkovska noted, for someone who started with such a high approval rating - the only way was down. Even so, while polling is limited in Ukraine because millions have fled and Russia occupies about a fifth of the country, a recent survey suggested Zelensky still has the support of 57% of Ukrainians. Russia's war on Ukraine has lasted far longer than Moscow intended - Putin had hoped to take Ukraine within a matter of days of launching what it calls its ""special military operation"". Three years since the start of the invasion, and while Russia continues to make territorial gains, Ukraine has managed to slow the advance and even mount a counter-offensive inside Russia itself. Ukraine's future is still uncertain, but Zelensky remains defiant in the face of Russian aggression."

They began a murder investigation in October, saying they were treating Kyran as missing, presumed dead. That same month they carried out a dig at his former family home in Emer Terrace, Dundalk, but there was no sign of his body. On Wednesday, a white cordon was erected around a house on Hand Street in Drogheda. Officers from the Garda Technical Bureau undertook a forensic examination of the property, including the rear garden. A mini-digger was used to excavate land. Kyran had been a pupil at the national [primary] school near his home in Dundalk until the summer of 2022. He did not return to class after the summer holidays and it is understood authorities were told he was moving to Northern Ireland and to a new school in Newry. Tusla, the Irish state agency responsible for child welfare and protection, said it received no referrals or concern about Kyran's attendance or educational welfare between 2022 and 2024. In December, two houses were searched in Drogheda. One of the searches involved the use of a cadaver dog. The results of the searches were not made public. The Garda Commissioner Drew Harris previously said he had never seen a case like this in his 40-year career in policing on both sides of the border."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0l11gr35gwo,"'In a scary world, he gives us hope': Faithful gather to support the Pope",2025-02-27T05:12:03.716Z,Sarah Rainsford,"Catholics gathered to pray for the health of the Pope beneath the steps of St Peter's Basilica for a third night, as his doctors said his condition showed further slight improvement. Nuns dangling rosary beads, tourists and student priests were among those who joined the gentle incantation of the rosary in the Vatican. They were led by a cardinal in a scarlet skull cap who prayed for Pope Francis to be able to resume his duties as soon as possible. The nightly gatherings began on Monday after the 88-year-old's health took a dramatic dip at the weekend. He was fighting to breathe and needed blood transfusions. But the latest statements suggest the Pope is able to sit in his chair, is eating normally and even doing what the Vatican calls ""light work"": reading and signing documents. ""It was a bit scary last weekend but a bit better now,"" Stacey, a medical student from Paris, told the BBC. She was attending the prayers for the Pope for a second time. ""Francis is very popular with young people because he's really open, and in a world that became a little scary, he gives us a lot of hope."" Xiomara, from Panama, said she felt drawn to this Pope in particular as he was ""a good man"". ""Prayers always help, they don't just hang in the air,"" she believes. Leading the rosary from beneath a white canopy was Cardinal Battista Re. He's the figure in the Vatican who would call a conclave - the closed gathering of senior clergy that elects a Pope - if Francis were not able to continue in the role. Despite the slight improvement, the Pope's medical team are still giving no prognosis. He was admitted to Gemelli hospital on 14 February with double-pneumonia and, according to the Vatican, a CT scan of his lungs shows a ""normal evolution"" which suggests he is responding to treatment. We're told he still uses additional oxygen but has suffered no further ""respiratory crises"". The tone of Vatican officials has certainly relaxed a little. On Tuesday, the Pope's condition was described as ""stable"", which was new. By Wednesday evening there was a ""further slight improvement"" and the update omitted to say ""critical"" for the first time. Vatican officials cautioned that didn't mean the Pope was out of the woods. But with so little to go on, those following his condition closely are wringing every word - or missing word - for meaning. Inevitably, many have also been wondering about the future. The Pope was frail even before this infection, so there has been speculation over whether he might resign. The Quotidiano Nazionale newspaper calls it the ""fluttering of crows"" over St Peter's, inevitable at the ""sunset"" of any Papacy. It's even louder this time since Benedict XVI set a precedent and stepped down in 2013, the first Pope to do so in six centuries. Francis has said before that he would consider resigning if he can't carry out his duties. ""His instinct will be to carry on as long as he can and is able to,"" believes Austen Ivereigh, who co-authored a book with Pope Francis. ""He's shown he doesn't mind being a weak and frail Pope; he can be a Pope in a wheelchair, or one who gets ill regularly and that's ok."" All the same, if his health prognosis were too bad, the author said, ""then the [resignation] issue might arise."" Even with Francis confined to the Gemelli hospital, the well-oiled Vatican cogs continue to turn. The bureaucracy functions and the Pope has been signing some documents. On Monday, his secretary of state and another senior official visited. Officially, the Pope signed papers, moving a list of candidates further along the path towards sainthood. But some question why they couldn't wait, given the frailty of the Pope, and wonder what other plans were discussed at that meeting. As Francis enters his 14th day in hospital, pilgrims to Rome are already experiencing life without him. His weekly audience, or meeting, with the faithful was cancelled for the second week. ""We really want him to get better and continue the amazing work he's started,"" said Mabi. She mentions the foregrounding of women in the church in particular. ""He's a people's Pope and people want his work to continue."" ""We're sorry, because we hoped to meet the Pope today at an audience – we had tickets,"" Fr Cristiano said. Around him almost 100 Catholics from northern Italy were gathering to begin processing up the street towards St Peter's behind a large wooden crucifix. ""I'm not disappointed, I'm just worried for him,"" the priest said. ""Today the news is not so bad, but it's not so good, either. So we need to pray."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17qe11wy52o,Leaked recordings challenge Greek account of deadly shipwreck,2025-02-27T00:23:25.454Z,Nick Beake Kostas Kallergis,"Leaked audio instructions by Greek rescue co-ordinators have cast further doubt on Greece's official version of events in the hours before a migrant boat sank along with up to 650 people onboard. The Adriana went down in the early hours of 14 June 2023 in international waters – but within Greece's rescue zone - after leaving Libya days earlier. Survivors later told the BBC that coastguards had caused their overcrowded fishing boat to capsize in a botched attempt to tow it and then forced witnesses to stay silent. The Greek coastguard denied these claims and maintains it did not try to rescue those onboard because they were not in danger and said they had voluntarily wanted to reach Italy, not Greece. But in a phone call that's now emerged an unnamed man speaking from inside a Greek rescue coordination centre is heard instructing the captain of the migrant boat to tell an approaching ship that those onboard do not want to reach Greece. The coastguard has not commented on the audio but said it had handed over all available evidence to a Naval Court which is investigating the disaster. The sinking was one of the worst-ever disasters known to have happened in the Mediterranean Sea. It is estimated the boat was carrying up to 750 migrants when it set off from the port of Tobruk in Libya nearly a week earlier. Eighty-two bodies were recovered, but the United Nations believes an additional 500 people - including 100 women and children who were in the hold of the boat - may have died. Audio recordings obtained by Greek website News247.gr reveal phone calls involving the Joint Rescue Coordination Centre (JRCC) at the port of Piraeus, near the capital Athens. In the first call, at 18:50 local time (15:50 GMT) on 13 June, an officer is heard explaining to the man piloting the migrant boat that a large red vessel will soon be approaching to give supplies and that he should explain that the migrants do not want to reach Greece. Officer 1: The replies of the man captaining the migrant boat are not heard. In a second call, 90 minutes later, at 22:10, a seemingly different officer from the same coordination centre, speaks to the captain of the Lucky Sailor (the ""big red ship""). Officer 2: OK, captain, sorry before I couldn't hear you. I couldn't understand what did you say to me. You told me you gave them food, water and they told you that they don't want to stay in Greece and they want to go to Italy, they don't want anything else? Lucky Sailor captain: Yes because I asked them by megaphone ""Greece or Italia?"" and everybody there screaming Italia. Officer 2: Aah, OK, OK everybody screaming that they don't want Greece and they want Italy? Lucky Sailor captain: Yes, yes, yes. Officer 2: OK Lucky Sailor captain: They are all like crowded people, very crowded, full deck. Officer 2: OK, captain. So you have finished with the supplies? Lucky Sailor captain: Yes, sir, yes. Officer 2: Captain, I want this, I want this to write it in your logbook. The bridge logbook. Lucky Sailor captain: Yes OK, we will write it. Officer 2: OK? Lucky Sailor captain: Yes Officer 2: I want you to write it about that they don't want to stay in Greece and they want to go to Italy. They want nothing from Greece and they want to go to Italy. Lucky Sailor captain: OK, yes, yes. Another vessel, the Faithful Warrior, also gave some supplies to the migrant boat but no further conversations between its captain and the Greek authorities have emerged. The Greek coastguard did not comment on the contents of the conversations but told the BBC it had submitted ""all the material it had in its possession, including the audio recordings and the diaries of events"" to the Maritime Court Prosecutor's Office, which is investigating. It said it had rescued more than a quarter of a million migrants in danger at sea in the last decade and arrested more than a thousand smugglers, and that its humanitarian work had been recognised internationally. Our BBC investigation in the immediate days after the sinking challenged the Greek authorities' explanation for the disaster. Analysis of the movement of other ships in the area suggests the overcrowded fishing vessel was not moving for at least seven hours before it capsized. The coastguard has always insisted that during these hours the boat was on a course to Italy and not in need of rescue. Last year, a Greek court threw out charges against nine Egyptian men who were accused of causing the shipwreck. The judges in the southern port city of Kalamata ruled they did not have jurisdiction to hear the case, on the grounds the vessel sank in international waters. Listen: Surviving Greece's migrant boat disaster The indictment had showed that the defendants were being prosecuted on evidence that had already been contradicted by at least six survivors, who told the BBC the coastguard had caused their boat to capsize and then pressured them to frame the Egyptians. Human rights lawyer, Dimitris Choulis, who represented some of the accused Egyptians said he was not surprised by what these recordings. ""We know about the coastguard's tactics of either pushing back or not rescuing people."" He claimed there had been ""an attempted cover up from day one."" ""They [Greek authorities] told the story 'they did not want to be rescued' and so have insulted the memory of so many dead people,"" he told the BBC. Human rights groups, including Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, have said they have strong reservations about the integrity of the Greek investigation and have called for an international investigation. The Greek Ombudsman - an independent authority removed from the government - has been looking at the allegations. The disaster is also being examined by the Greek Naval Court."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9de53y43lvo,New search for missing six-year-old Kyran Durnin,2025-02-26T21:10:02.468Z,,"A house in Drogheda, County Louth, is being searched as part of the investigation into the murder of a six-year-old boy who disappeared more than two years ago.

Officers from the Garda Technical Bureau undertook a forensic examination of the property, including the rear garden. A mini-digger was used to excavate land. The search has been stood down for the night and is set to resume at first light on Thursday. Kyran was originally reported missing alongside his mother, Dayla Durnin, in August 2024. One of Kyran's grandmothers claimed she had last seen them in her home in Drogheda and, at that time, she appealed for her daughter Dayla to contact her. Dayla was later found alive in Great Britain without Kyran. Gardaí investigating the schoolboy's disappearance have made two arrests during the course of their inquiry so far. A man and a woman were arrested two days apart in mid-December but they were both released without charge within a day of being detained. The man, who was arrested on suspicion of Kyran's murder, was found dead at his home in Drogheda just days after his release from custody. He was named locally as 36-year-old Anthony Maguire. Confirming the latest search at a ""domestic residence"" in Drogheda, gardaí said they were ""aware of ongoing extensive public commentary"" on their investigation. They warned that most of the speculation, rumours and theories on what may have happened to Kyran was ""inaccurate and misinformed"". ""Such ill-informed public commentary is not only disruptive to the Garda investigations but also adds to the trauma experienced by victims families,"" they added. Kyran had been a pupil at the national [primary] school near his home in Dundalk until the summer of 2022. He did not return to class after the summer holidays and it is understood authorities were told he was moving to Northern Ireland and to a new school in Newry. Tusla, the Irish state agency responsible for child welfare and protection, said it received no referrals or concern about Kyran's attendance or educational welfare between 2022 and 2024.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrxy1zp8mxo,Bosnian-Serb leader sentenced to jail in landmark trial,2025-02-26T21:03:11.477Z,Guy Delauney,"A one-year prison sentence and a six-year ban on holding public office might seem like a heavy penalty for a politician. But the Bosnian-Serb leader Milorad Dodik made light of the verdict at the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. The president of the country's majority-Serb Republika Srpska region told supporters at a rally in the regional capital Banja Luka there was ""no reason to worry"". His conviction on charges of ignoring the rulings of the international High Representative was ""nonsense"", he said. Dodik said he had ""learned to deal with more difficult things"" and called on the crowd in Republika Srpska's de facto capital to ""be cheerful"". The verdict was the culmination of a long-running conflict between Dodik and the international High Representative for Bosnia and Herzegovina, Christian Schmidt. Schmidt is still the supreme authority in Bosnia, 30 years on from the Dayton Agreement which ended the Bosnian War of the 1990s. The high representative has the power to impose or annul laws – and sack officials ranging from judges to political leaders. One former holder of the post, Paddy Ashdown, the former leader of the UK's Liberal Democrats, sacked almost 60 Bosnian-Serb officials in a single day in 2004, in a crackdown on their protection of war criminals. But the high representative's powers have been used much more sparingly in subsequent years, as Bosnia's international supporters stepped back in the hope that local leaders would work together to create a viable and prosperous country. The strategy has not been a success. Ethno-nationalist leaders remain entrenched in a country which is divided into two ""entities"" – the majority-Serb Republika Srpska and the Federation, where the population are mostly Bosniaks and Croats. The central government is weak – and there is little incentive for parties to cooperate. Instead, their guiding philosophy is simple and self-interested: divide, rule and profit. As a result, the country is struggling with low wages, a sluggish economy and a constant flow of emigration by talented people seeking a better future elsewhere. ""Bosnians of all ethnicities are united by their disdain for their own leaders,"" says Toby Vogel, co-founder of the Democratisation Policy Council think tank. ""They would love not to vote for these guys, but it's structurally almost impossible for cross-community politicians and parties to emerge."" Instead, leaders like Dodik get elected, time after time. The leader of the SNSD party has previously served as the Serb representative of the three-person national presidency and first became prime minister of Republika Srpska in 1998. A constant theme of his leadership has been the threat to trigger the secession of the majority-Serb region. Dodik and his government have consistently worked to undermine Bosnia's national institutions, introducing a series of laws to withdraw Republika Srpska from the armed forces, judiciary and tax system. Such efforts eventually pushed the high representative to take action and annul the secessionist legislation. Christian Schmidt warned that a renewal of conflict was possible, but insisted that he would ""not sit still while others seek to dismantle [decades] of peace, stability and progress"". Dodik apparently viewed that as a challenge. He approved a law declaring that Republika Srpska would no longer recognise Schmidt's rulings. The high representative had already annulled the legislation – and made it a criminal offence to contradict his decisions. That led to the prosecution of the Bosnian-Serb leader – with prosecutors calling for a maximum five-year prison sentence and 10-year ban from holding elected office. Dodik warned he would take ""radical measures"" if found guilty. His conviction has not brought any fireworks so far. At this point, Dodik is insisting that he will not appeal. Instead, Republika Srpska's government is once again proposing legislation to withdraw from national institutions – including the court which passed the guilty verdict. But Dodik is facing problems beyond Bosnia's borders. The US and UK have imposed sanctions on him and his family for corruption - threatening the unity of Bosnia and Herzegovina - and connections with Russia. Toby Vogel believes that is more likely to threaten the Bosnian-Serb leader than the court conviction. ""The conflict with the high representative will intensify,"" he says. ""But Dodik might well be running out of road."" ""He is running out of cash to pay his bloated administration… and he can no longer raise money on international markets. So, he is in very deep trouble indeed."" None of this will be much comfort to the long-suffering people of Bosnia and Herzegovina. They are still enduring the interminable wait for the prosperity promised by ethno-nationalists like Dodik. This latest court battle shows how distant that prospect remains."

Norwegian media reported an avalanche fell while the men scaled a frozen waterfall at Gaustatoppen mountain on Friday. Rescuers reportedly failed to recover the man who died for several days due to poor weather conditions. The Foreign Office said: ""We are supporting the family of a British man who has died in Norway, and a British man who has been injured, and are in contact with the local authorities."" An avalanche fell on the mountain in Norway's southern Telemark county early on Friday afternoon, Norwegian media reported. Rescuers were said to have airlifted one of the climbers to hospital with non-fatal injuries on Saturday. Efforts to recover the second man were postponed several times due to bad weather, Norway's NRK reported. ""Prevailing weather conditions, avalanche danger and accessibility made it a very complicated and demanding task to get in and down to the climbers,"" local emergency manager Tor Einar Bakken told the broadcaster. Fire and police officers reportedly recovered his body on Tuesday morning using ropes and by abseiling, as poor conditions meant it was not possible to use a helicopter."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70eky7l6pxo,Romanian far-right presidential hopeful detained on street and indicted,2025-02-26T17:11:57.047Z,Paul Kirby & Mircea Barbu,"Far-right populist Calin Georgescu, who came from nowhere to win the first round of last year's presidential election, has been detained by police and is facing criminal proceedings on a series of charges. Georgescu was stopped in traffic in the capital, Bucharest, on his way to register as a candidate for new elections in May, after last December's second-round run-off was annulled by the constitutional court. Prosecutors said one of the charges involved attempted ""incitement to actions against the constitutional order"". Two right-wing populist parties said they were mobilising their supporters to head for the prosecutor's office, where Georgescu was taken for questioning. Police were seen erecting barriers around the building and hundreds of demonstrators gathered to protest. Prosecutors said Georgescu was also being investigated for giving ""false information, false statements"" and for setting up an organisation with ""fascist, racist or xenophobic characteristics"" as well as forming an antisemitic organisation. The severity of the indictment could jeopardise Georgescu's bid to run in the presidential election on 4 and 18 May. He has been placed under judicial control and told not to leave Romania, according to reports. As he left the prosecutor's office, Georgescu told supporters he would continue to fight and that there was ""no difference between the communist mentality and system [that collapsed in 1989] and now"". The original presidential vote was cancelled before the second round last December, after the then president, Klaus Iohannis declassified intelligence documents that suggested that hundreds of TikTok accounts had been activated backing Georgescu. Romanian foreign intelligence said Russia had been behind the move, as well as thousands of cyber-attacks and other sabotage. Iohannis had decided to stay in office until a successor was elected, but he resigned earlier this month ahead of an impeachment vote. Opposition politicians had at the time accused Iohannis of an undemocratic move, and Georgescu's communications team repeated the claim against prosecutors. ""Where is democracy now?"" they posted on X on Wednesday, tagging President Donald Trump, Elon Musk and US Vice-President JD Vance. Earlier this month, the US vice-president accused Romania of annulling the elections based on ""flimsy suspicions"" of Romanian intelligence and pressure from its neighbours. Romanian Foreign Minister Emil Hurezeanu accused Elon Musk of a ""form of interference"" in Romania's elections, after the billionaire posted several messages of support for Georgescu. Georgescu's hopes of running for the presidency may end up at the constitutional court, which barred another far-right, pro-Russian candidate from running last year. The decision to turn down Diana Sosoaca's candidacy because of her views was widely criticised in Romania. Romania is a vital part of Nato's eastern flank as well as being a member of the European Union. Calin Georgescu has been accused of being pro-Russian and he has praised Romania's fascist and nationalist leaders from the last century as heroes. He denied he was ""Moscow's man"", in a BBC interview last year, but referred to Vladimir Putin as a ""patriot and a leader"" while pointing out ""I am not a fan"". Meanwhile, Romanian police said they had carried out raids in several counties around the country, targeting 27 individuals as part of a criminal case relating to the creation of an organisation ""with a fascist, racist or xenophobic nature"". Investigations were also being conducted into false statements regarding the sources of election campaign funding, police said. The statement made no mention of Georgescu himself and it was not clear if the raids were linked, however he said he was fighting a security system ""that wants us in slavery""."

The celebrated author, who wrote dozens of novels and plays, was born in Dublin in 1930 and in the 1970s moved to Londonderry, which became her home for much of her adult life. A child of the playwright Denis Johnston and actor and producer Shelah Richards, her first novel, The Captains and the Kings, was published in 1972 and How Many Miles to Babylon? two years later. In 2012, she was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award at the Irish Book Awards and was one of the writers nominated in 2014 for the position of first Irish Laureate for Fiction. Ms Johnston had been diagnosed with dementia and died on Tuesday at a nursing home in Dún Laoghaire, County Dublin. The President of Ireland, Michael D. Higgins, led tributes to the author. ""Throughout her many novels and plays, Jennifer Johnston provided a deep and meaningful examination of the nature and limitations of identity, family and personal connections throughout the tumultuous events of 20th Century Irish life,"" he said. ""It is noteworthy that her work has always been championed by so many of her fellow writers, who have acknowledged her as one of the finest of Irish novelists. ""So many of them have recorded her as a strong influence on so much of their own work."" Ms Johnston was a much loved and celebrated figure in Irish literature, known for exploring themes like Anglo-Irish identity and the Troubles in Northern Ireland. How Many Miles to Babylon?, the story of an unlikely friendship between two boys from very different social backgrounds during World War One, remains a set text for English literature students. Her novel Shadows on Our Skin was shortlisted for the Booker Prize in 1977. The book, which was set in Derry in the 1970s, followed Joe Logan navigating teenage life against a backdrop of bombs and bullets. The Irish government's minister for arts and culture, Patrick O'Donovan, said Ms Johnston was ""one of Ireland's most celebrated authors"", adding she ""has been rightly acclaimed among the best novelists in the world"". Chair of the Arts Council in Ireland Maura McGrath said she was ""an esteemed literary voice whose work captured the complexities of Irish life with extraordinary depth and sensitivity"". She said Ms Johnston's body of work ""resonated across generations, and her contribution to Irish literature will endure"". Irish broadcaster Miriam O'Callaghan said she had been a ""remarkable talent"" and a ""trailblazer for women"". Ms Johnston's friend, Mary Murphy, described her as a ""formidable force"" with ""a wicked sense of humour"". ""She was a brilliant conversationalist, an evening spent with Jennifer would have you going from being stimulated intellectually and philosophically one minute, and the next, you would be bent over laughing,"" Ms Murphy told BBC Radio Foyle's Mark Patterson Show. Ms Murphy said Ms Johnston never did anything half-hearted and put her heart and soul into everything she did, adding that her body of fantastic work is testament to that. She also described her deep love for the city of Derry and its people, saying she was very happy to call the place her home for so long. ""She became very quickly part of the intellectual life of the city,"" Ms Murphy said. ""Jennifer loved it here, she was thoroughly involved here."" Mary Murphy added that she would remember her as a dear friend and, above all else, a truly fantastic writer whose work will stand the test of time."

Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organization - was formed in Washington DC in 1949 by 12 countries: Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Iceland, Italy, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, the UK and the US. Nato's primary purpose
, external
was to block expansion in Europe by the former Soviet Union - a group of communist republics which included Russia. Members agree that if one of them is attacked, the others should help defend it.
, external Nato does not have its own army, but member states can take collective military action in response to crises. For instance, the body supported the UN by intervening in the war in the former Yugoslavia between 1992 and 2004. It also co-ordinates military plans and carries out joint military exercises.
, external Nato has 32 members across Europe and North America - the original 12 founders plus 20 countries which have joined since 1949. After the Soviet Union's collapse in 1991, many Eastern European countries became members, including Albania, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania and Slovakia. Finland - which has a 1,340km (832 mile) land border with Russia - joined in April 2023. Sweden became a member in March 2024. Having been neutral for decades, both applied to Nato in May 2022, shortly after Russia invaded Ukraine. Ukraine, Bosnia and Herzegovina, and Georgia have also asked to join. Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine becoming a member, fearing it would bring Nato forces too close to its borders. However, in 2008, the alliance said that Ukraine could eventually join
, external
. After Russia's invasion, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky asked for this process to be fast-tracked. Former Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg said Ukraine could join ""in the long term"" but not until after the war ended. However, speaking at a defence summit in Brussels in February, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth said ""the US does not believe that Nato membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement"". Some Nato defence chiefs pushed back against the comments. German defence minister Boris Pistorius said ""he regretted"" the decision to rule out Ukraine joining Nato without a wider discussion. Sweden's defence minister Pal Jonson insisted membership was ""not off the table"". Zelensky later said he was prepared to ""give up"" his presidency if it meant Ukraine could join Nato. ""If to achieve peace you really need me to give up my post, I'm ready,"" he told reporters. ""I can trade it for Nato membership, if there are such conditions."" The Trump administration's decision to align itself with Russian President Vladimir Putin over the war in Ukraine has cast doubt on America's long-term commitment to both European security and Nato itself. In votes at the United Nations in New York, to mark the third anniversary of the Russian invasion, the US twice sided with Russia instead of its Nato colleagues. European leaders are having to react quickly to a changing security situation. Incoming German Chancellor Friedrich Merz said his ""absolute priority"" in office would be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible ""so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA"". Nato leaders are due to meet in June but Merz questioned whether that summit would involve Nato in its current form ""or whether we will have to establish an independent European defence capability"". Hegseth sets out hard line on European defence and Nato Trump calls Zelensky a 'dictator' as rift between two leaders deepens Can Europe still count on the US coming to its defence? In January, Trump urged Nato's European members to spend 5% of their national income - or GDP - on defence
, external
, telling reporters: ""They can all afford it."" Hegseth echoed this call, saying the US would no longer ""tolerate an imbalanced relationship"" with its allies. Nato secretary-general Mark Rutte has also urged member states to boost their defence spending. It is thought that 23 countries met the 2% target in 2024, compared to only three in 2014. The countries which have traditionally spent the largest share of GDP on defence are the US and those close to Russia, such as Poland and the Baltic states. Sir Keir - who is due to meet Trump in Washington at the end of February - has said the UK will increase its defence spending from 2.3% of GDP to 2.5% by 2027. This would mean an extra £13.4bn of defence spending every year from 2027, he told House of Commons. The rise would be funded by cutting the UK's aid budget from 0.5% of GDP to 0.3%, Sir Keir said. Before the general election, Labour had promised to raise development spending by the same amount. How much do Nato members spend on defence? Will Starmer's defence hike win over Trump? Nato previously described Russia's invasion of Ukraine as the ""most significant and direct threat to allies' security"".
, external The alliance has not sent troops to Ukraine or enforced a no-fly zone over the country for fear of being pulled into a direct conflict with Russia. However, individual member states have supplied arms and equipment. German research organisation the Kiel Institute
, external
said that under former President Joe Biden, the US had allocated 59.9bn euros (£49.7bn) for military support to Ukraine between February 2022 and October 2024. European Nato members provided 52.6bn euros (£43.7bn) over the same period. The US, UK, Germany and Turkey and others have sent anti-tank weapons, missile defence systems such as Patriot, artillery guns, tanks and drones. The US, UK and France have also supplied long-range missiles such as Atacms and Storm Shadow/Scalp. In August 2024, Ukraine received two US-made F16 fighter jets - the first of more than 60 pledged by Nato member states. Since November 2024, the US and UK have allowed Ukraine to use their missiles to hit targets within Russian territory. Hegseth has suggested the US will significantly scale back its support for Ukraine, and that European nations will have to provide the majority of military aid. UK Defence Secretary John Healey said the UK had ""heard a clear message from the US about stepping up and we are"". He highlighted a new £150m package which includes drones, tanks and air defence systems. What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine? Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia"

A man has been arrested in connection with the investigation and is currently detained. Stena Line has confirmed that an incident occurred this afternoon on the 14:00 sailing from Fishguard in Wales to Rosslare, County Wexford. Gardaí and emergency services were alerted to the incident shortly after 17:00 local time and embarked the ship which is currently docked at Rosslare Harbour. A woman was later pronounced dead and her body remains at the scene. A large force of gardaí, including armed officers, and other emergency services are at the scene. Irish broadcaster RTÉ reported that the ship's captain made an emergency call around half an hour before the ship docked. The scene has been preserved for technical and forensic examination. The Office of the State Pathologist and local coroner have been made aware of the incident. A post-mortem examination will be carried out and gardaí said the outcome will determine the course of the investigation. The 19:00 local time outbound Stena sailing from Rosslare to Fishguard was cancelled. Passengers are being accommodated by Irish ferries on the 20:45 sailing from Rosslare to Pembroke, according to the company. RTÉ reported that all passengers and crew on the ship will be interviewed as part of the investigation."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9dl4drr8lo,German politics froze out the far right for years – is this about to change?,2025-02-25T13:08:08.773Z,Paul Kirby & Kristina Volk,"One in five German voters put an X in the box for Alternative for Germany (AfD) on Sunday: a record result that has made them the second biggest force in German politics. Riding on the back of that success, the party is now calling for an end to the consensus in German politics not to work with the far right. That ""firewall"" - Brandmauer in German - has worked since the end of World War Two, but AfD joint leader Tino Chrupalla says: ""Anyone who erects firewalls will get grilled behind them."" There is a determination among all of Germany's main parties to keep that block in place - and the German public backs them up: 69% see the AfD as a threat to democracy, according to voters surveyed on Sunday. Friedrich Merz, who won the election for the conservatives, believes the only reason the AfD exists is because of problems such as migration and security that need to be addressed: ""We need to resolve these problems... then that party, the AfD, will disappear."" The AfD won 20.8% of the vote nationally, and as the light blue areas of the map show, it was dominant in the five states in the east, securing 34%. ""East Germans have made it very clear they no longer want a firewall,"" said Tino Chrupalla. Friedrich Merz will now go into talks on forming a government with the Social Democrats, who came third. Even though his party won 28.6% of the vote, it was still their second-worst result since World War Two. Support for the AfD doubled, and a million of their voters deserted Merz's conservatives for them, according to a survey by research institute Infratest dimap. Voters have not been put off by the fact that Germany's domestic intelligence classifies parts of the AfD as right-wing extremist - or that the party has now embraced a policy called ""remigration"". The AfD argues that remigration means deporting immigrants convicted of crime, but the term has been used by the extreme right to mean mass deportations. One of the big issues for the Christian Democrats is how to get their voters back and stop losing more. Merz has already flirted with the AfD in parliament, relying on their votes to push through a motion on migration. But he was clearly stung by a public outcry and the mass protests that followed in many German cities. Germany's chancellor-in-waiting is unlikely to try that again, especially if he forms a government with the centre-left. But now the AfD has more than 150 seats in parliament, its supporters in particular believe it is time for the firewall to go. ""I just hope that the firewall will fall. But we all know that it won't be like that,"" says pro-AfD TikTok influencer Celina Brychcy, 26. ""I think it will fall at the latest when new elections are held. Then they'll have to realise at some point they can't get through with what they're doing right now."" ""I think the Brandmauer will stay,"" says Dominic, 30, who voted for the AfD in Saxony. ""I want the government to really think about their own people and their own country."" Read more on the German election here: Merz signals seismic shift in transatlantic relations Five key takeaways from German election Conservatives celebrate, but AfD doubles vote  Pressure to take down the long-standing firewall is not just coming from the AfD, but from leading figures in the Trump administration too, including US Vice-President JD Vance and Elon Musk, who has repeatedly backed the party. Most of the voices you hear challenging the firewall come from the east, which may not be surprising considering the deep reach of the AfD, especially in the five eastern states out of a total of 16 across Germany. They won 38.6% of the vote in Thuringia and 37.% in both Saxony and Saxony-Anhalt, far ahead of the CDU. It makes them increasingly difficult to keep at arm's length. On one of the big talkshows on German TV on Monday night, Harsh but Fair, one local mayor from Saxony, Mirko Geissler, believed the AfD should be put on the ""playing field"", so they could show what they could do. If not, they would end up surging to 40-50% in the polls, he warned. Liane Bach, an independent mayor from a village in Thuringia said that in her region, ""AfD voters aren't right-wing extremists"". A CDU politician on the programme, Phillip Amthor, conceded there should be ""no firewalls between the democratic parties and people who vote AfD"". That is the main issue the big national parties will have to address. How to avoid ostracising AfD voters who clearly have no problem with the firewall being breached. One mayor pointed out that one of her fellow residents who was also an AfD councillor was fixing the local fountain. It made no sense not to work with him. Prof Conrad Ziller from the University of Duisburg-Essen believes the greatest threat to the firewall could come at state level, rather than nationally. ""If you have trouble building a coalition in a state, then at some point, there could be a minority government that relies on the AfD, or gets votes from the AfD from time to time."" On a national level, the worst-case scenario would be for a breakdown in a Merz-led coalition: ""Merz could make mistakes. If he gets really tough on immigration, it might become problematic with the SPD."" Germany has already seen one early election because of a coalition collapse, and the AfD's Alice Weidel has made clear she is looking for early elections. Her repeated appearances on TV election debates have made her a prominent figure in Germany and helped raise her party's profile. But it was the constant focus on migration and security that became the number one issue for AfD voters, partly fuelled by three deadly attacks, all allegedly carried out by immigrants. Tackling insecurity, and the perception of it, will be an immediate task for the next government, when it eventually takes shape. Underlying the urgency, Bavaria's centre-right leader Markus Söder said the need to tackle immigration, along with Germany's faltering economy, was ""in fact, the last bullet of democracy"". There is no question of breaching the long-standing firewall for the moment. And the general secretary of Merz's party, Tom Unger, was adamant that there should be no collaboration with a party that opposed Germany's ties with the West, its membership of Nato and ""the European idea"". That was incompatible, he said, with the conservatives' ""core DNA""."

The gallery in Dublin purchased the X-ray system valued at €124,805 (£103,520) as part of a Digital Investigative Imaging Project in November 2017. At the time, the equipment was described as essential for examining the gallery's paintings in a non-destructive way. However, Irish broadcaster RTÉ has reported that officials could not find a place to put the scanner due to concerns about the ""load-bearing capacity"" of potential locations. The National Gallery has been working with the Office of Public Works to find a suitable place for the scanner, but one has not been found so far. The gallery is now said to be looking to use it as a ""mobile unit on-site"" and it could come into use later this year. On Tuesday, Irish Minister for Arts Patrick O'Donovan is bringing the annual report of the National Gallery to the government. Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Micheál Martin said it was ""very difficult to explain why someone would embark upon purchase of a scanner that they didn't have a facility to locate it in"". ""I think it falls on the gallery itself to explain what happened here,"" he added. Tánaiste (Deputy Prime Minister) Simon Harris said: ""My reaction to this is the same as the reaction that every person will have right across this country - which is one of absolute fury. ""Government provides money to state agencies. They do very good work, but they're also accountable for the spend of that money. ""So the first thing I want to do today is hear from the minister in relation to this, and then I'm quite sure that people will want to hear from the National Gallery itself."" Analysis by Kevin Sharkey, BBC News NI Dublin reporter The Irish public is becoming increasingly fed up with what is now commonly regarded as the repeated waste of public money. The new Irish government is already picking up where the last government left off with yet another scandal around how taxpayers' money is being used. It comes in a month when the government had to order an external review of governance and culture at The Arts Council after the public body spent €7m (£5.8m) on an unsuccessful IT system. These most recent revelations have come hot on the heels of other public spending controversies towards the end of last year. It emerged that a security structure was built at the Department of Finance in Dublin at a cost of more than €1.4m (£1.2m) and a bike shelter was built in the grounds of the Irish parliament costing €336,000 (£283,149). Opposition parties will not miss another opportunity to highlight what they regard as a lack of proper government oversight on how taxpayers' money is spent on public projects."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj30xr1vy2lo,Countries compete to keep skilled young workers,2025-02-25T00:03:56.588Z,Pedro Garcia,"In 2020, Duarte Dias, a Portuguese software engineer, accepted a job offer to work in Microsoft's Dublin subsidiary. A little over a year later, he joined a team at Microsoft's headquarters in Seattle, where he still works. Even though he misses the Portuguese laid-back approach to life, and the family-like team spirit of the work environments there, he does not regret, not for one second, his choice of pursuing an international career. Mr Dias's decision was made easier by all the financial impact of moving. The verdict of the spreadsheet was clear: staying in Portugal would be financially ruinous. ""I did simulations of how much money I would save a year in Portugal, and I quickly realised that I wouldn't be able to have a comfortable life financially, even if I got one of the most well-paying jobs available in engineering for my experience level,"" says. A two-year job experience in Portugal while Mr Dias was concluding his masters at Lisbon's Instituto Superior Técnico cemented his conviction: his yearly income amounted to €35,000 ($36,000; £29,000). But his take home salary was much, much less. His income placed him in a tax bracket which meant up to 40% of this gross salary went to the state. ""Financially it was bad. It would be very hard to save money if I didn't live with my parents,"" he recalls. Moving to Ireland meant an immediate hike in his salary prospects, almost doubling to €60,000. The money is even better in the US, where he now earns upwards of $160,000 before a 20% income tax rate, much lower than at home. Mr Dias intends to return to Lisbon in two years' time with ""with many more savings"". Keeping skilled workers like Mr Dias in Portugal has been a concern for recent governments. In 2020, the administration led by the Socialist Party's Antonio Costa launched IRS Jovem, a programme of tax reductions for workers less than 30 years old and tiered by level of education. In 2022, 73,684 taxpayers benefitted from this incentive, according to official data. After a snap election in March, the new centre-right Portuguese government led by Luis Montenegro doubled down on the idea and expanded it from five to 10 years, and to all workers under 35 independently of their educational levels. The proposal, passed by the Portuguese parliament in late November, is due to benefit up to 400,000 workers, according to the Portuguese Ministry of Finance. But specialists say it likely won't be enough to keep the young from going abroad. ""It is unlikely that, on its own, the tax regime will make young workers remain in the country, whether because professional opportunities are more abundant in foreign countries, or due to the fact this tax benefit applies only to yearly incomes under €28,000,"" says Sérgio Vasques, professor of tax law at the Católica Lisbon School of Law. He points out that the Portuguese government still takes more of the average worker's salary than most richer nations. Known as the tax wedge, the ratio between the amount of taxes paid by an average single worker without children and the corresponding total labour cost for the employer, stands at 42.3% in Portugal. That's the 8th highest among the 38 member countries of the OECD. ""This is a tax regime that is an enemy of qualified work and professional success. This regime will not solve this problem,"" adds Mr Vasques. Mr Vasques, also a former secretary of state for tax affairs in the early 2010s, adds: ""I also cannot imagine a young professional deciding to move to Portugal just because of an extra couple hundred euros at the end of the year. ""Not even a low-skilled worker will make a decision based on that. Portuguese food works probably better as an incentive to move here than that tax regime"". Rita de La Feria, chair of tax law at the University of Leeds, reminds that the exodus of young people isn't just a Portuguese problem, and that Europe is grappling with the challenges of young emigration. According to a study requested by the Portuguese Parliament, as of July, in the European Union Portugal, Poland and Croatia had special tax regimes based on the taxpayers' ages. ""The challenges are very obvious: worker mobility is higher. The problem is that the country spends very large amounts on training for them to leave for other countries as soon as they enter the workforce,"" she said. Ms de La Feria, who moved to the UK at a young age, told the BBC that when she left Portugal she did not intend to ""leave for good: many leave their countries of origin thinking they will come back at some point. But once they form a family, it's almost impossible to return."" Antonio Almeida, a software engineer like Mr Dias, left Portugal during the pandemic in late 2020 for a job in Berlin, right after finishing his degree. He would change the German capital for Brussels two years later. All his work experience was done abroad. ""Back in 2020, we were offered monthly salaries of €1,300, gross, in Lisbon. Berlin offered me €4,200 for a junior role."" Even with a 40% income tax rate in Germany, there was a considerable net gain. ""It wasn't a difficult decision,"" says Mr Almeida. Now in Belgium - where taxes are higher, he stresses - returning to his homeland isn't a priority. ""I think of returning eventually, mainly for family reasons. ""But at the moment my life standards are very high and I like the way of life of central Europe. And the main problem in Portugal is low salaries, not taxes."" Mr Almeida does not consider the Portuguese tax changes as a major factor when thinking of the pros and cons of coming back home. ""Up until today I never thought about it."" Mr Dias agrees: ""Salaries outside Portugal will always be higher, and all those who don't have any personal or familial connections to the country won't have any kind of financial or career incentive to stay there""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwygdl5xxklo,"Pope's condition has slightly improved, Vatican says",2025-02-24T21:49:57.375Z,George Wright Sarah Rainsford,"Pope Francis's health has slightly improved but he remains in a critical condition, the Vatican has said in a medical update. On Sunday, the Pope's condition was said to be critical with respiratory and kidney problems. But the Vatican has now said that a ""slight"" kidney problem was not a cause for concern, more than a week after he was admitted to hospital. ""Even today there were no episodes of asthmatic respiratory attacks; some laboratory tests have improved,"" said the Vatican in an evening bulletin on the 88-year-old's health. The pontiff resumed some work on Monday and called the Priest of the Parish of Gaza ""to express his fatherly closeness"", the Vatican added. The Pope is having oxygen therapy but doctors ""are prudently not yet disclosing the prognosis"", a statement said. This is certainly the most positive statement on the Pope's health in a couple of days, but his condition is still described as critical. His doctors are not ready to give any kind of prognosis. That said, Vatican sources this evening said that Francis has been eating ""normally"" and ""can move"". He is not bedridden. He has no fever, and no apparent sign of sepsis. On Friday his doctors described such a development as the greatest risk, in his situation. The work the Pope was said to be doing on Monday afternoon was ""light""- reading and signing documents. He has been calling a Catholic parish in Gaza most evenings throughout the war there. It's thought this is the first call he has been able to make in recent days, although did keep up the practice when he was first hospitalised. On Saturday, the Vatican said that the Pope had experienced a respiratory crisis and was in a ""critical"" condition, but later on Sunday released an update that he had ""not presented any further respiratory crises"". Earlier on Sunday, the Pope issued a statement asking Catholics to pray for him after he was unable to deliver the traditional Angelus prayer in person for the second week running. And at 21:00 (20:00 GMT) on Monday, those cardinals who are in Rome gathered outside St Peter's Basilica to lead prayers for the Pope, together with members of the Vatican curia and clergy from the Diocese of Rome. They will continue to gather each evening, from now on, to recite the Rosary. Monday evening's prayer will be led by Cardinal Parolin, who is Vatican's secretary of state. The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy - an inflammation of the lungs - as a young man and underwent a partial lung removal. The leader of the Roman Catholic Church has been admitted to hospital multiple times during his 12-year tenure, including being treated for bronchitis at the same hospital in March 2023. From Argentina, Pope Francis is the first Latin American, and first Jesuit, to lead the Roman Catholic Church."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr72v17z5jeo,Ex-surgeon admits 'despicable acts' in French child abuse trial,2025-02-24T20:48:54.818Z,Laura Gozzi,"A French former surgeon accused of abusing hundreds of patients, most of them children, has told a court that he admits to having ""committed despicable acts"" and ""understands and shares the suffering"" caused to his alleged victims. Joel Le Scouarnec is accused of assaulting or raping 299 patients, the vast majority under 15 years old, between 1989 and 2014, mostly in Brittany. ""I am perfectly aware that these wounds are indelible, beyond repair,"" Le Scouarnec said, in a halting but clear voice. The white-haired 74-year-old, who wore glasses and a black zip-up sweater over a grey shirt, was addressing the court in Vannes, north-west France, on the first day of the largest child abuse trial in French history. Warning: This story contains distressing details ""I can't go back, but I owe it to [the victims] and their relatives to admit my actions and the consequences they had and that they undoubtedly will continue to have throughout their lives,"" Le Scouarnec told the court. Throughout the day - which was mainly devoted to technical proceedings - he had looked attentive but had no particular reaction when two visibly nervous men in their 30s took the stand to identify themselves as his victims. The youngest of Le Scouarnec's alleged victims was aged one and the oldest 70. Police were able to identify them thanks to meticulously-compiled diaries in which Le Scouarnec is alleged to have logged assaults he carried out on his young patients over more than 25 years. He has already been imprisoned since 2017 for abusing four children, of which he was found guilty in 2020. Many of the plaintiffs were allegedly abused while they were under anaesthesia or recovering from surgeries in hospitals across northern France - meaning a number of them had no recollection of the abuse they are said to have sustained, and had to be told by police that their names appeared in Le Scouarnec's diaries. ""Everything in this terrible story is out of the ordinary... it wasn't the victims that approached the investigators but the investigators that alerted the victims,"" public prosecutor Stéphane Kellenberger said in court. ""Many of them had no memory... several would have rather gone on not knowing. But silence had reigned for too long."" Many other people, who do remember being allegedly abused, have said the impact of the events has followed them their whole lives, in many cases resulting in serious psychological trauma. Mauricette Vinet, the grandmother of a patient of Le Scouarnec who killed himself some years ago, told the BBC her grandson Mathis had been ""killed"" by Le Scouarnec's alleged abuse. ""If he hadn't happened Mathis would still be here,"" she said. Defence lawyer Maxime Tissier told the trial on Monday that Le Scouarnec admitted to the ""vast majority"" of the charges against him and that his client would soon ""explain himself"" with regard to the accusations. ""He is a defendant who has made himself entirely available to the court... despite his age,"" Mr Tissier said. Le Scouarmec added in court that during his police examinations he did his best to ""admit to the events which constituted rape and those that, in my view, did not"". Dozens of lawyers were also present in court, but the hundreds of alleged victims they represent were sat in a separate overflow room due to their sheer number. Several psychologists and emotional support dogs will be on hand throughout the course of the trial. Aude Buresi, the presiding judge, read out a graphic and gruelling summary of the charges against Le Scouarnec, as well as excerpts from his interrogations in 2020, in which the former surgeon initially denied that his diaries reflected real-life abuse and were merely retellings of his ""fantasies"". But Ms Buresi said several elements - including the level of detail and choice of words used by Le Scouarnec - indicated that the diaries were most likely truthful. In his short statement to the court on Monday, the former surgeon referred to his writings as ""very violent"". An hour before proceedings kicked off a few dozen protesters staged a rally outside the courtroom, carrying letters spelling out the phrase ""Stop the code of silence"", while another sign read ""Who knew?"" Victims and child advocacy groups have said ""systemic failures"" allowed Le Scouarnec to continue working with children. In 2005, the FBI warned the French authorities that he had been accessing child abuse websites, but this just resulted in a suspended sentence and he faced no consequences in the workplace. Later, when Le Scouarnec was working in the hospital of Quimperlé, he allegedly made sexually-charged comments about a young patient of his, raising the suspicions of a colleague who alerted the regional medical association and made them aware of the suspended sentence. The members of the association were summoned and all but one doctor - who abstained - voted that Le Scouarnec had not violated the medical code of ethics. The BBC has approached the regional medical association for comment The association is now pressing charges against Le Scouarnec for ""bringing the medical profession into disrepute,"" the body's secretary Didier Robin said on Monday. His statement elicited a swift rebuttal from lawyer Frédéric Benoist, who represents a child protection advocacy group La Voix de L'Enfant (The Child's Voice) and has previously told the BBC that Le Scouarnec was able to commit his deeds due to ""a huge degree of dysfunction"" among medical professionals. Mr Benoist said it was ""morally indecent and legally questionable"" that the medical association was allowed to be listed as a plaintiff. ""It is unacceptable that [the association] is sat alongside the victims,"" he said. Monday's session closed early - something that is unlikely to happen again over the course of the trial, which will run on a tight schedule and is due to end in June. At the request of the plaintiffs, some sessions will be held behind closed doors - but big portions of it will be open to journalists and members of the public. Le Scouarnec's ex-wife and his siblings will be heard in court on Tuesday. Asked why she was attending proceedings that will undoubtedly include sordid and graphic details of abuse, one woman queuing to enter the overflow room told the BBC she wanted to see ""this doctor, this Mr Everyman"". ""I want to see what human nature can be capable of, because all of this - it's just beyond me,"" she said."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjry2pv1wr5o,Zelensky says he hopes to end Ukraine war 'this year',2025-02-24T19:59:26.677Z,George Wright,"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said ""we hope that we can finish this war this year"" on the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion. But he warned that Ukraine needs security guarantees to prevent Moscow returning, suggesting EU and Nato membership will help. Russia has consistently opposed the idea of Ukraine joining Nato. Earlier, Zelensky said a peace deal with Russia could start with a ""full"" exchange of prisoners of war. Zelensky was speaking at a summit of European leaders, plus Canadian PM Justin Trudeau, who were in Kyiv to show their support. Speaking at a news conference, Zelensky was asked what his hopes were for Ukraine and its people after three years of war. ""We hope that we can finish the war this year,"" he responded, adding that it had been ""very difficult"" for the whole nation. In the short term, he said Ukraine needed security guarantees to prevent Russia returning in years to come. Joining the EU and Nato soon would ""help us very much"", he added. Zelensky recently said that he would be willing to stand down as president if Ukraine was made a member of Nato in return. Russia said it would not accept this as part of any peace deal. He was asked about the US and his relationship with President Donald Trump several times, but did not respond directly. Zelensky said he hoped ""that the United States will continue support, like all the partners"". Last week, Trump called the Ukrainian president ""a dictator"", and said he had done a ""terrible job"" of leading Ukraine. It followed Zelensky saying Trump was ""living in a disinformation space"" governed by Moscow. Trump has repeatedly called for a ""quick peace"" - an end to hostilities that would see Ukraine make considerable concessions to Russia. Zelensky also said a complete prisoner of war exchange with Russia could be the ""start"" of ending the war. There have been 60 prisoner exchanges between the two sides since the war began, including one in December involving hundreds of prisoners swapped. ""This is the fair and just option,"" Zelensky said, noting that there are thousands of Ukrainians detained in Russia - some who have been held since the Crimea invasion in 2014. Ukraine does not publish numbers of prisoners of war being held by Russia, but the total is thought to be more than 8,000. Attendees at the summit included European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, European Council President Antonio Costa and the leaders of Canada, Denmark, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania, Finland, Norway, Spain and Sweden. Other leaders, including from the UK, Germany and Japan, spoke by video link. There was no sign of US representation. Trudeau said ""might no longer means right in this world"" - in an apparent reference to recent high-level talks between Russia and the US. Danish PM Mette Frederiksen said she was ""open minded"" about sending peacekeeping troops to Ukraine if and when the war ends, but added that ""a lot of questions have to be answered"" first. ""In this fight for survival, it is not only the destiny of Ukraine that is at stake. It's Europe's destiny,"" von der Leyen wrote on X. At the news conference, she said that Ukraine could join the European Union before 2030 if it continues the speed and quality of its reforms. The summit was happening ahead of French President Emmanuel Macron's meeting with Trump in Washington DC, where Ukraine was expected to be top of the agenda. Tens of thousands of soldiers and civilians have died since Russia launched its full-scale invasion three years ago, while large swathes of Ukraine have been destroyed."

""The night went well, the Pope slept and is resting,"" a Monday morning statement said. Vatican sources said the Pope was in good humour and eating normally - a slightly more upbeat message than they'd been giving over the weekend, following his sudden breathing difficulties on Saturday. The Pope was admitted to Rome's Gemelli Hospital on 14 February after experiencing breathing difficulties for several days, where he was first treated for bronchitis before being diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. On Sunday, the Pope's thrombocytopenia - a condition that occurs when the platelet count in the blood is too low - was stable, a statement said. The Vatican did not offer a prognosis, given the ""complexity of the clinical picture"". On Saturday, the Vatican said that the Pope had experienced a respiratory crisis and was in a ""critical"" condition, but later on Sunday released an update that he had ""not presented any further respiratory crises"". Earlier on Sunday, the Pope issued a statement asking Catholics to pray for him after he was unable to deliver the traditional Angelus prayer in person for the second week running. And at 21:00 (20:00 GMT) on Monday, those cardinals who are in Rome will gather outside St Peter's Basilica to lead prayers for the Pope, together with members of the Vatican curia and clergy from the Diocese of Rome. They will continue to gather each evening, from now on, to recite the Rosary. Monday evening's prayer will be led by Cardinal Parolin, who is Vatican's secretary of state. The pontiff is particularly susceptible to pneumonia, an infection of the lungs that can be caused by bacteria, viruses or fungi, after he contracted pleurisy - an inflammation of the lungs - as a young man and underwent a partial lung removal. The leader of the Roman Catholic church has been admitted to hospital multiple times during his 12-year tenure, including being treated for bronchitis at the same hospital in March 2023. From Argentina, Pope Francis is the first Latin American, and first Jesuit, to lead the Roman Catholic Church."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx29wlje6dno,Five key takeaways from the German election,2025-02-24T17:27:36.211Z,Paul Kirby,"Friedrich Merz's conservatives have won, but Germany's 2025 election has thrown up some important and fascinating stories that reveal a country in flux. Alternative for Germany, or AfD, has doubled its support in just four years to 20.8%, and has spread out from its support base in the east to become the second biggest political force in parliament. Meanwhile, outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz's SPD had its worst performance in decades, only securing 16.4% of the vote. Here are five key takeaways. Look at an election results map of Germany, and you could almost have travelled back in time to the Cold War, when an iron curtain divided communist East Germany from the west. In the east it's a swathe of AfD light blue, apart from pockets like Berlin and half of Leipzig. In the west the vast majority has turned conservative black, especially in Bavaria where Merz's conservative sister party, the CSU, dominates the landscape. But the AfD is spreading in the west too, and political loyalty to the old mainstream parties has gone. For one in five Germans it has become normalised. ""They're just normal people,"" said one young man of immigrant origin in Duisburg, a city in western Germany's old industrial heartland. Even though it came second, the AfD is blocked from being part of the next government because of a ""firewall"" - or Brandmauer - operated by Germany's main parties, who do not co-operate with any party seen as extremist since the end of World War Two. The AfD's leader Alice Weidel insists it is a libertarian, conservative movement, not racist. Its big increase in public support has coincided with a series of deadly attacks in the past nine months, all allegedly by immigrants. The AfD has embraced a highly controversial policy called ""remigration"", which it defines as deporting migrants who have committed crimes. But the term can also refer to the mass deportation of migrants and their descendants. In May 2024 a German court rejected an AfD appeal against a ruling classifying it as a suspected far-right extremist organisation. Judges found that the AfD had ""positions that disparage the democratic order and are incompatible with the principle of democracy"". In three German states in the east - Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony - domestic intelligence has designated the AfD as right-wing extremist. A leading AfD figure in Thuringia, Björn Höcke, has twice been convicted of using a banned Nazi slogan ""Alles für Deutschland"" - everything for Germany. Alice Weidel supporters have chanted her name during the election campaign, using the phrase ""Alice für Deutschland"". Not since 1987 has turnout been as high as 82.5% in a German election, and that was three years before reunification of east and west. Four years ago it was 76.6%. Put simply, more than four in every five of Germany's 59.2 million voters turned out. It reflects just how energised Germans have been by this election, which comes at a pivotal moment for their country. There were nine TV debates in the final stretch of the campaign, but that reflected the broad interest of the audience. The three-party government of outgoing Chancellor Olaf Scholz fell apart at the end of last year, and within 24 hours of Sunday's election, all three leaders have said they're leaving the front line of politics. The leader of the economic liberals, the FDP, was first. Christian Lindner has led his party for 11 years. But it failed to get any MPs elected and Lindner has said he's leaving politics after 25 years. It was Lindner's refusal to compromise on debt rules that first brought the government down, and then sent his party into the wilderness. Although Scholz will remain as chancellor until the next government is formed, he won't be taking part in coalition talks and will be leaving frontline politics. Greens Vice-Chancellor Robert Habeck is also leaving frontline politics after his party fell below 12% in the election. Until a few weeks ago, the Left party looked doomed when one of its leading lights, Sahra Wagenknecht, went off and founded her own, more populist, party with eight other MPs. Wagenknecht's popularity soared for a while as head of her BSW party, but ultimately fell just below the 5% threshold for getting into parliament. The story was very different for the Left (Die Linke), which came back from the dead with an inspired social medial campaign. Heidi Reichinnek, Die Linke's co-chair, went viral after she gave a speech enthusiastically defending the firewall against the AfD. She now has 580,000 followers on TikTok and her post has attracted seven million views. Her party secured just under 9% of the vote. Die Linke's viral videos helped secure a quarter of the 18-24 vote, and the AfD were not far behind with 21%, according to surveys by ARD TV. Alice Weidel was the biggest hit on social media during the election, even bigger than Heidi Reichinnek. She has attracted more than 935,000 followers on TikTok. For the over-35s, it was the Christian Democrats who won out, and more men than women."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwd2001d10o,Macron to warn Trump against looking weak to Putin,2025-02-24T15:09:37.760Z,Jacqueline Howard,"French President Emmanuel Macron is due to meet Donald Trump in Washington later, the first one-on-one meeting between the pair since the US president re-entered the White House. Macron said in a social media Q&A that he would warn Trump against appearing weak to Russian President Vladimir Putin. It comes after the US held direct talks with Russia for the first time since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. He is also due to present European proposals to achieve peace in Ukraine after the US president accused him of having ""done nothing"" on the matter. The meeting takes place on the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. Other European leaders have been in Kyiv in a show of support. On Thursday, Macron told a social media audience that Trump also needed to think about how his interactions with Putin would appear to other world leaders. ""It's not you, it's not your trademark, it's not in your interest. How can you then be credible in the face of China if you're weak in the face of Putin?"" Macron said. He added that he would seek to persuade Trump that the interests of the US and Europe were aligned, and that ""if you let Russia take over Ukraine, it would be unstoppable"". That means any peace deal must be negotiated with Ukrainians and Europeans around the table, Macron said. Such an appeal to the US president's ego is a conscious choice from Macron, who knows Trump from the latter's first term in power, Sebastien Maillard from the Chatham House think tank says. ""Macron is trying to touch on what could be more emotion than on pure rational arguments,"" Mr Maillard said. Trump wants to appear as a strong man who got a peace deal quickly, he said, so Macron's strategy ""is to demonstrate to Trump how weak he would look, he would not be the strong man he wants to be"". ""If he treats Putin too kindly he will not be respected by China, Iran or other enemies."" More broadly, Macron's visit is likely to be part time-buying operation for Europe and part fact-finding mission, according to Mr Maillard. ""This is a last chance mission because Europe senses that things are hurrying up - they are afraid that this could be done too quickly and badly,"" Mr Maillard said. He added that the international community was ""bewildered"" by this ""new Putin-Trump axis"", and that ""Macron wants to understand what the future of Nato is"". ""So that he is not taken by surprise at the next speech or next tweet,"" Mr Maillard added. An advisor to Macron's office said that the French president would also use the meeting to present ""proposals for action that reflect the convergences that emerged"", AFP reported.  Those convergences refer to Washington's sudden policy shift in engaging Russia directly. Within a month of taking back the White House, Trump had Putin on the phone and sent a delegation of US representatives to meet with Russian counterparts in Saudi Arabia. Those talks resulted in an agreement to appoint teams from both countries to start negotiating the end of the war. Russia also said it would not accept peacekeeping forces from Nato countries in Ukraine under any peace deal, a proposal that had ben raised a day earlier at a meeting of European members of Nato in Paris arranged hastily by Macron. Macron's meeting with Trump comes ahead of UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer's own visit, which is due on Thursday. Like the French leader, Starmer has also been accused by Trump of having done nothing to end the war. The UK leader also responded to Trump calling Zelensky a ""dictator"" by saying he was his country's ""democratically elected leader"". Both Macron and Starmer will be looking to present a united front to Trump to convince him against making decisions about Ukrainian and European security without involving Europeans, Mr Maillard said."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwd209jd1jo,Irish PM pledges more financial support for Ukraine,2025-02-24T14:56:00.816Z,,"The taoiseach (Irish prime minister) has said the Republic of Ireland will ""contribute more financially"" to Ukraine as it continues to defend itself from Russia. Micheál Martin was speaking via videolink to international leaders who have gathered in Kiev on the third anniversary of the Russia invasion. Mr Martin was addressing a conference led by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. ""We do need to say more, we do need to spend more and we need to do more,"" the taoiseach said. ""Ireland will contribute more financially on all fronts and in all areas, and will strengthen our commitment on that front."" Mr Martin also said that Russia must not be rewarded for its invasion of Ukraine. The conference was held against a backdrop of controversial US-Russia talks aimed at ending the three-year conflict. Zelensky was not invited to the peace talks in Saudi Arabia and last week US President Donald Trump called him a ""dictator without elections"". In contrast, many Western leaders, including Mr Martin, have been expressing their support for Ukraine in the face of ongoing Russian aggression. The taoiseach also posted a video on social media in which he paid tribute to Ukraine's ""heroic"" defence efforts and pledged ""steadfast"" support from Ireland. ""Three years on from the launch of Russia's barbaric and illegal full-scale invasion it is important that we continue to highlight what is happening on our continent,"" he said. Mr Martin added that in spite of having ""endured unimaginable violence and suffering"" Ukrainians had shown ""inspirational resolve and determination"". ""Today, we honour their heroic efforts to defend their country,"" the taoiseach said. ""We recognise that as Ukrainians defend their nation, they are defending fundamental European and universal freedoms, the rights of all people to live peacefully within their own borders without fear of being attacked."" Shortly after the war began on 24 February 2022, the Republic of Ireland introduced a generous resettlement scheme for Ukrainians fleeing from the violence. Benefit payments given to Ukrainian refugees arriving in Ireland reached €232 a week but in December 2023 the payment rate was reduced to €38.80. More than 112,000 people have applied for temporary protection under the Irish scheme since March 2022. By late last year almost 80,000 Ukrainian refugees were still living in the Republic of Ireland, according to Ireland's Central Statistics Office."
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-60506682,Ukraine in maps: Tracking the war with Russia,2025-02-24T12:51:11.000Z,the Visual Journalism Team,"Fighting has raged in Ukraine since Russia launched a full-scale invasion three years ago. Russian forces have slowly expanded the amount of territory they control over the past year, mostly in the east of Ukraine, but Ukrainian forces have made those advances as slow and difficult as possible and have staged a counter-offensive into Russian territory. Here is a recap of recent significant events and the situation in Ukraine. With the third anniversary of Russia's invasion, US President Donald Trump says Russia's President Vladimir Putin has agreed to start negotiations to end the war. But diplomatic wrangling over a potential peace deal continues, with Ukraine, European allies and the US offering differing visions for how to end the conflict. Meanwhile, Volodymyr Zelensky said he would be willing to ""give up"" his presidency in exchange for peace. In eastern Ukraine, Moscow's war machine has been churning mile by mile through the wide open fields of the Donbas, enveloping and overwhelming villages and towns. Russia's biggest advantage is manpower and it has shown a willingness to throw soldiers at Ukrainian positions to gain a few metres at a time. Experts at the Institute for the Study of War expected Russian forces to focus on seizing frontline Ukrainian towns and cities over the winter - they have recently taken the town of Kurakhove and have continued advancing to the north east, towards the city of Pokrovsk. The Russian advance towards Pokrovsk is the most notable change in control of the front line near Donetsk for several months, but innovative tactics by Ukrainian forces, combining the use of drones and ground forces, have inflicted significant losses of troops and equipment and slowed the offensive. It has taken a year for Russia's troops to advance about 40km (25 miles) west - Ukraine was forced to withdraw from Avdiivka, just north of Donetsk, in February 2024 after months of fighting. Almost all of Avdiivka's pre-war population of more than 30,000 people have left and the town itself is almost completely destroyed. In addition to its operation on the eastern front, Russia began what the ISW describes as its ""subordinate main effort"" when it crossed the international border to the north of Ukraine's second-biggest city, Kharkiv, in May 2024. Several villages were seized and thousands of civilians fled. The Russian push took place at the end of a four-month period when the US was not supplying weapons to Ukraine, due to a stalemate in the US Congress which was resolved last April. Ukrainian forces eventually held firm and even though the city of Kharkiv has come under repeated attack from glide bombs fired by Russian warplanes, it remains beyond the range of Russian artillery. Eastern Ukraine has been contested territory since 2014, when Russian-backed fighters seized large swathes of the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Russia had already seized the southern peninsula of Crimea in February 2014 before annexing it soon afterwards. Trump has said it is unlikely Ukraine will return to its pre-2014 borders but, in response to a question from the BBC, he said ""some of that land will come back"". In an interview with the Guardian, published on 11 February, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky suggested that Russian-held territory in Ukraine could be swapped for territory seized by Urainin Russia's western Kursk region in recent months as part of a peace deal. Ukraine seized control of part of the region in a surprise attack launched across the border by Ukrainian troops in August, advancing up to 18 miles (30km) into the Russian region. Almost 200,000 people were evacuated from areas along the border by the Russian government, and Putin condemned the Ukrainian offensive as a ""major provocation"". After two weeks, Ukraine's top commander claimed to control more than 1,200 sq km of Russian territory and 93 villages. Some of that territory has been regained by Russia but Ukraine still has troops in the Kursk region. Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov described Zelensky's suggestion of a territory swap as ""impossible"". Russia's full-scale invasion began with dozens of missile strikes on cities all over Ukraine before dawn on 24 February 2022. Russian ground troops moved in quickly and within a few weeks were in control of large areas of Ukraine and had advanced to the suburbs of Kyiv. Russian forces were bombarding Kharkiv, and they had taken territory in the east and south as far as Kherson, and surrounded the port city of Mariupol. But they hit very strong Ukrainian resistance almost everywhere and faced serious logistical problems with poorly motivated Russian troops suffering shortages of food, water and ammunition. Ukrainian forces were also quick to deploy Western supplied arms such as the Nlaw anti-tank system, which proved highly effective against the Russian advance. By October 2022, the picture had changed dramatically and, having failed to take Kyiv, Russia withdrew completely from the north. The following month, Ukrainian forces recaptured the southern city of Kherson. Since then, the battle has mostly been in the east of Ukraine with Russian forces slowly gaining ground over many months, with at least 70,000 Russian troops killed - and an estimated 500,000 being either killed or injured in total, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. By Dominic Bailey, Mike Hills, Paul Sargeant, Chris Clayton, Kady Wardell, Camilla Costa, Mark Bryson, Sana Dionysiou, Gerry Fletcher, Kate Gaynor and Erwan Rivault To indicate which parts of Ukraine are under control by Russian troops we are using daily assessments published by the Institute for the Study of War with the American Enterprise Institute's Critical Threats Project. The situation in Ukraine is often fast moving and it is likely there will be times when there have been changes not reflected in the maps."

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxnzkyw7n1o,Friedrich Merz: Risk-taker who flirted with far right,2025-02-24T09:44:22.401Z,Jessica Parker,"Friedrich Merz - leader of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) - is set to become Germany's next Chancellor. His party is projected to win around 28% of the vote. The question now is who he might form a coalition with. Described by his supporters as an antidote to Europe's crisis of confidence, Merz, 69, is a familiar face to his party's old guard. Politically, he has never come across as exhilarating. And yet he promises to provide Germany with stronger leadership and tackle many of his country's problems within four years. As election results came in on Sunday evening, he grabbed attention by declaring that the US appeared indifferent to Europe's fate and questioned the future of Nato, demanding that Europe boost its own defences. His explosive bid last month to tighten migration rules with the support of far-right votes in parliament revealed a man willing to gamble by breaking a major taboo. It also marked yet another clear break from the CDU's more centrist stance under his former party rival Angela Merkel. Although Merz ultimately failed to change the law, he had launched a lightning bolt into an election campaign triggered by the collapse of Chancellor Olaf Scholz's government late last year. Famously sidelined by Merkel before she became chancellor, he quit parliament entirely to pursue a lucrative series of corporate jobs and was written off as yesterday's man. But he now looks set to clinch the job he has coveted for so long. On 23 January, one month before Germany's snap federal election, people gathered in one of Berlin's five-star hotels to hear Merz give a foreign policy speech. The buzz around the ""ballroom"" in the Hotel de Rome isn't exactly electric - but it is a far cry from 20 years ago, when his political career looked over. Merz is also a licensed pilot, who drew criticism in 2022 for flying to the north German island of Sylt in his private plane for the wedding of fellow politician Christian Lindner. As he takes to the stage in the Hotel de Rome, there's polite applause for the leader of Germany's conservative CDU opposition, who are consistently ahead in the polls. Tall, slim, in a suit and glasses, Merz cuts a calm, conventional, business-like figure as he tries to project a readiness for power. But it has been a winding journey to get to this point. Merz was born in the west German town of Brilon in 1955 into a prominent conservative, Catholic family. His father served as a local judge, as does Friedrich Merz's wife Charlotte to this day. The younger Merz joined the CDU while still at school. In an interview 25 years ago with German newspaper Tagesspiegel he laid claim to a wilder youth than his strait-laced CV might suggest. Among his misadventures, he described racing through the streets on a motorcycle, hanging out with friends by a chip stand and playing the card game Doppelkopf in the back of the class. A teenage party he referenced ended up with a group of students taking a collective pee in the school aquarium, according to Der Spiegel magazine. There is some scepticism that the teenage Merz was much of a rabble-rouser. A former classmate recalled that the young Friedrich's disruptive behaviour more often amounted to simply wanting ""the last word"". Whether on or off the record, people who have known him have told me he enjoys a beer and can indeed be fun, though few were able to offer an anecdote to illustrate this. After school, he went on to military service before studying law and marrying fellow student Charlotte Gass in 1981. The couple have three children. For a few years, Merz worked as a lawyer but he always had his eye on politics and was elected to the European Parliament in 1989, aged 33. ""We were both quite young and very fresh and let's say unspoilt,"" says Dagmar Roth-Behrendt, who became an MEP at the same time for the centre-left Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). She found the young Merz to be serious, reliable, honest and polite. Even humorous – a quality that she feels is less obvious now: ""I assume the amount of bruises over time might have hardened him a bit."" But did he come across early in his career as a potential chancellor? ""I would have probably have said no, no way. Come on, you must be kidding!"" Yet everyone knew him to be deeply ambitious and Merz soon made the switch from EU politics to Germany's national parliament, the Bundestag, in 1994. He rose through the ranks, touted as a talent on the party's more right-wing, traditionalist faction. ""He's a splendid speaker and a profound thinker,"" says Klaus-Peter Willsch, a CDU member of the Bundestag who has known him for more than 30 years. ""A fighter,"" says Willsch, evidenced by the fact that Merz made three attempts to lead his party. His first two failures, in 2018 and January 2021, could also be read as a sign of his struggle to woo the grassroots. But it was back in the early noughties, when his ambitions were initially derailed, that he lost out to Angela Merkel in a party power struggle. Merkel, the understated quantum chemist from the former communist east, and Merz, the overtly assured lawyer from the west, never much saw eye-to-eye. Merz glosses over this bitter episode in a brief autobiographical post on the CDU website, saying that by 2009 he had decided to leave parliament to ""make room for reflection"". His years of reflection involved forging a career in finance and corporate law – becoming a boardroom executive at various international firms and, reputedly, a millionaire. It would be more than a decade before he returned to parliament, where he has since sought to rip up Merkel's more centrist doctrine on CDU conservatism. A marked moment of political severance came at the end of January, when Friedrich Merz pushed through a non-binding motion on tougher immigration rules, by relying on votes from the far-right Alternative für Deutschland (AfD). He insisted there had been no direct collaboration with the AfD, but his move led to mass protests and was twice condemned by none other than Merkel herself. These were rare public interventions by the woman who ruled Germany for 16 years. Detractors said it was an unforgivable election gambit, but supporters insisted Merz was, in fact, seeking to lure people cleverly from the far right. He has risked alienating more moderate parts of the electorate before, voting in the 1990s against a bill that included the criminalisation of marital rape. He later explained that he considered marital rape to already be a crime, and it was other issues in the bill that he objected to. Polls suggest he is not especially popular among young people and women - but Klaus-Peter Willsch believes the picture painted of him in German media is unfair. ""I had him several times in my constituency,"" he tells me. ""Afterwards, women come up and say he's a nice guy."" Charlotte Merz has likewise come to his defence, telling the Westfalenpost: ""What some people write about my husband's image of women is simply not true."" She says their marriage has been one of mutual support: ""We both took care of each other's jobs and divided the childcare in such a way that it was compatible with our professional obligations."" Whatever the critiques, one EU diplomat told me Brussels was ""anxiously awaiting his arrival"". ""It's time to move on from this German deadlock and get that motor running."""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgenlw94n3o,"Germany's conservatives celebrate, but far right enjoy record result",2025-02-24T09:31:05.190Z,Paul Kirby,"Friedrich Merz's conservatives have won Germany's election, well ahead of rival parties but short of the 30% vote-share they had expected. ""Let's celebrate tonight and in the morning, we'll get to work,"" he told cheering supporters. His immediate priority is to try to form a government with the third-placed Social Democrats of Olaf Scholz. Even before the result was clear, Merz said his top priority was unity in Europe, so that ""step by step, we can really achieve independence from the US"". The other big winner in Sunday's vote was the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), who are celebrating a record second-place result of 20.8%. The AfD's candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, did a victory lap of her supporters, but even her party had hoped for a greater result and the mood at AfD HQ was subdued. Merz, 69, has never held a ministerial job, but he has promised if he becomes the next German chancellor to show leadership in Europe and beef up support for Ukraine. Most Germans have been shocked by President Donald Trump's conduct towards Ukraine and Europe and Friedrich Merz said the US leader had shown ""the Americans are largely indifferent to the fate of Europe"". Trump has labelled Ukraine's leader a ""dictator"" and two of his leading figures have openly backed the AfD in the run-up to the vote. Vice-President JD Vance was accused of meddling in the vote during a visit to Munich, while billionaire Elon Musk has made repeated remarks on his X platform. Friedrich Merz's first priority will be to try to form a coalition made up of his Christian Democrats (and their Bavarian sister party, the CSU) and Scholz's centre left, despite the Social Democrats' worst-ever showing of 16.4%. Merz's CDU party leadership will meet on Monday and so will the Social Democrat SPD's, separately, but Scholz will not take part in the talks. Merz is keen to form a government by Easter. It could be possible, because between the two parties, they have 328 seats, a majority of 12 in the 630-seat parliament. But it was not until the early hours of Monday that that became clear. After the collapse of Olaf Scholz's three-party coalition late last year, Merz had asked the electorate for a strong mandate to form a clear-cut coalition with one other party. In the event, he secured enough seats only because two of the smaller parties failed to get into parliament. A two-party coalition would enable him to solve as many of Germany's problems as he could in four years, he said, from a stagnant economy to closing its borders to irregular migrants. German voters had other ideas. They came out in big numbers, with a 83% turnout not seen since before reunification in 1990. Merz's Christian Democrats had been looking for more than the 28.6% of the vote they and their Bavarian sister party received. His most likely partner was always going to be the Social Democrats - known in Germany as a GroKo, or grand coalition. But Germany's electorate has fractured, and the two big beasts of its post-war politics can no longer be sure of success. The AfD under Alice Weidel enjoyed a 10-point increase in support on four years ago, their support boosted by anger over high prices and a series of deadly attacks in German cities. Three took place during the election campaign. Weidel also benefited from a successful TikTok campaign that drew in big numbers of young voters. As results came in during the early hours of Monday, it became clear the AfD was far ahead of the other parties in the east, with a projected 34%, according to a survey for public broadcaster ZDF. ""Germans have voted for change,"" said Weidel. She said Friedrich Merz's attempt to forge a coalition would ultimately end in failure: ""We'll have fresh elections - I don't think we'll have to wait another four years."" But just as the election map turned light blue in the east, much of the rest of Germany turned black - the colour of the CDU. And Merz dismissed the rise of the AfD out of hand. ""The party only exists because there have been problems that haven't been solved. They're happy if these problems get worse and worse."" ""We need to solve the problems... then that party, the AfD, will disappear."" Merz was equally withering towards the new Trump administration. President Trump did welcome Merz's victory. He said it was proof that Germans were, like Americans, tired of ""the no common sense agenda, especially on energy and immigration"". If it was an overture, Merz did not take it as one. He told a round-table TV discussion on Sunday night that the interventions from Washington had been ""no less dramatic and drastic and ultimately outrageous than the interventions we have seen from Moscow"". Last week, Trump appeared to accuse Kyiv of starting the war which Russia unleashed on its neighbour exactly three years ago. Merz's victory was quickly welcomed by leaders across much of Europe. France's Emmanuel Macron spoke of uniting at a time of uncertainty to ""face the major challenges of the world and our continent"", while the UK's Sir Keir Starmer sought to ""enhance our joint security and deliver growth for both our countries"". Friedrich Merz's Christian Democrats continue to rely on older voters for their success, while voters aged 18-24 appear to be far more interested in both the AfD and another party, the Left, which surged in the polls in recent weeks. Not long ago, the Left was heading out of the parliament, with poll numbers well below the 5% threshold. But a series of TikTok videos showing co-leader Heidi Reichinnek giving fiery speeches in parliament went viral and they ended up close to 9%, and a quarter of the younger vote, according to an ARD survey."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpv4n0dg3v3o,New German leader signals seismic shift in transatlantic relations,2025-02-24T08:06:39.751Z,Katya Adler,"Germany's chancellor-in-waiting didn't wait for the final results of his country's election on Sunday to herald a new era in Europe. Declaring the US indifferent to this continent's fate, Friedrich Merz questioned the future of Nato and demanded Europe boost its own defences. Quickly. This tone from the close US ally - and from Friedrich Merz who is known to be a passionate Atlanticist - would have been unimaginable even a couple of months ago. It's a seismic shift. That may read like hyperbole, but what we are now experiencing in terms of transatlantic relations is unprecedented in the 80 years since the end of World War Two. Big European powers have been shocked to the core by the Trump administration, which suggests it could revoke the security guarantees to Europe in place since 1945. ""I would never have thought that I would have to say something like this in a TV show but, after Donald Trump's remarks last week... it is clear that this government does not care much about the fate of Europe,"" Friedrich Merz said during a post-election debate on Sunday. ""My absolute priority will be to strengthen Europe as quickly as possible so that, step by step, we can really achieve independence from the USA,"" he added. Merz hinted that the endeavour was so urgent that he was not sure on whether the transatlantic alliance leaders gathering for a summit in June ""would still be talking about Nato in its current form or whether we will have to establish an independent European defence capability much more quickly"". Significantly, the forthcoming chancellor put Donald Trump's America on a par with Russia - widely viewed here as a security threat to Europe more broadly. ""We are under such massive pressure from two sides that my absolute priority now really is to create unity in Europe,"" Merz said. The UK prime minister heads to Washington on Thursday, following the visit there on Monday by French President Emmanuel Macron. Friedrich Merz admits, indirectly, to a sense of Fomo - fear of missing out. By rights Germany should be there, too, this week, he says. Berlin, is one of Europe's Big Three powers, alongside France and the UK. And with the US and Russia now pow-wowing bilaterally, about, but not with, Ukraine, it feels like a global return to big-power politics. But Germany has been MIA [missing in action] for a good while now on the European and the world stage. The outgoing government here was weakened and distracted by vicious internal bickering. This infuriated German voters - who wanted urgent focus on the economy and migration - and European allies, demanding action on Russia, security and defence. Merz says a top priority for Germany is to re-engage internationally. The country is already the second-biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine, after the US. Merz wants to continue that support, but, unlike France and the UK, he's been reticent about the idea of sending soldiers to Ukraine, to back up an eventual ceasefire there. Based on Germany's track record though - it dragged its heels at every stage of Ukraine support, and despite that, ended up delivering more aid than any of its European neighbours - a 'No' now, doesn't mean a 'No' forever to committing troops or participating in whatever form a European ""reassurance force"" in Ukraine may take. For now, the soldiers Germans most worry about are the 35,000 American ones, stationed in their country, that make them feel safe. It's highly unusual for foreign policy to be a top voter concern at election time. But in Germany this weekend, alongside the economy and migration, voter after voter said they worried about peace in Europe and felt very insecure. Back in November, Germany's interior ministry said it was drawing up a list of bunkers that could provide emergency shelter for civilians. Ukraine may be far away, but Germans feel at great risk from Russia for two reasons. Firstly, the amount of military equipment their country has sent Ukraine. The far right, Alternative for Germany (AfD), with its ""Germany First"" slogan, campaigned for Berlin to disengage from Kyiv and to re-establish relations with Russia. A strategy not unlike Donald Trump's, as the party is fond of pointing out. Secondly, many in Germany think that if Russia wanted to really destabilise Europe, it might be tempted to strike one of the Big Three with a long-range missile. France and the UK are nuclear powers. Germany is not. Even its conventional military is woefully understaffed and underequipped (to the immense irritation of European partners), so Germany fears it's a soft target. All the more so if President Trump withdraws his active servicemen and women from Germany. He has pledged to significantly reduce US troop presence in Europe as a whole. The German sense of deep domestic insecurity prompted Friedrich Merz to suggest last week that he'd look to France and Britain to form a European nuclear umbrella, to replace US nuclear guarantees. It's an idea that's easy to bring up on the campaign trail, but that in reality is hugely complex - involving questions of capabilities, commitment and control. The reality check: Friedrich Merz will need a lot of money for his plans to secure Germany and Europe, and Germany's economy is depressed. He also has to reach agreement with the coalition partner, or partners, with whom he'll form the next German government - as well as with other European countries, like the UK. And they may not want to strike such a strident tone against the US. This election may herald stronger leadership from Germany. But is the rest of Europe ready?"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5g6q5wnz3o,"Love, loss and duty: Ukraine's photojournalists share stories of war",2025-02-24T00:55:58.265Z,George Burke,"In the three years since Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine, hundreds of photographers have documented the human impact of the war on the front line and in civilian areas. Some of them have shared stories about their photos which have appeared in BBC coverage since February 2022. Prior to the full-scale war, this husband and wife team worked as wedding and portrait photographers in the Black Sea port city of Odesa. They soon moved ""from capturing love stories, to documenting Russian war crimes"", recalls Vlada. She knows first-hand the risks in her work. An explosion on a visit to the Donetsk region in 2023 left her with shrapnel lodged deep in her side, which doctors decided could not be removed. This powerful shot taken by Kostiantyn Liberov in the summer of 2024 was featured in Paul Adams' report on the Ukrainian offensive over the Russian border in Kursk. A soldier is seen consoling his desperate comrade after returning from an assault in which a fellow serviceman was killed. For Liberov, the image mirrors some of the confusion within the military over the operation. ""To lose your friend in an attack inside Russia, rather than defending our country in Ukraine, is very difficult,"" he said. ""I took this photo because of the emotional impact it had on me. It says a lot about the situation and how hard it was for them."" Photographing such deeply affecting scenes has taken its toll on local photojournalists. ""It's not something we talk about a lot with colleagues as it's painful,"" says Vlada. ""You are in a very hard situation, and no-one quite understands what the solution can be."" One 2023 photo of hers captures a member of Ukraine's White Angels police unit after an unsuccessful attempt to convince one of the last remaining residents to leave the eastern city of Aviidvka before Russian forces sweep in. The story was part of a BBC article on a devastating 24-hour Russian bombardment. A man had asked the police unit to evacuate his brother from the basement of a burnt out building, and yet he still refused to leave. ""The next day we could not return because of hard shelling,"" Vlada remembers. ""The situation got much worse and I'm not sure he could have survived. It hurts knowing you cannot return to these places."" In documenting so much loss and suffering, the couple have found a deeper appreciation of moments of joy. Dmytro, who has fought in Ukraine for more than a decade, was photographed after his wife gave birth in March 2024. ""We used to take photos of him in the trenches. And then you see this big, brave soldier crying while he takes his small daughter in his hands, and you understand soldiers like him fight for these moments. Not just for themselves, but for everyone in Ukraine."" Since 2016, Valeria Demenko has chronicled the work of Ukraine's state emergency service (DSNS) in the north-eastern Sumy region, and she now joins rescue teams deployed to areas hit by Russian shelling. ""It's always difficult… you never know what danger awaits you. It is especially difficult when residential buildings come under attack"". One moment engraved on her memory involved a striking image featured in a story in March 2024 showing emergency workers at the scene of a five-storey building that collapsed after Russian shelling, with residents still inside. Valeria recalls how emergency workers attended the site for four days straight. They found four dead, but never recovered the body of a missing girl. ""There was a doll on one of the upper floors... it meant a child was living there, and there may have been more."" Although all her colleagues are emotionally stretched, she wants the world to see their work: ""We give every last ounce of strength to document Russia's crimes against peaceful Ukrainians."" Alexander Ermochenko has spent the past 11 years documenting Ukraine's war as a photojournalist in the eastern Donetsk region. He has often reported in Russian-controlled territory too and ""never thought I'd be photographing war in my home"". ""The fear on the face of the owner of a destroyed house is the same on both sides of the front. It is always important to show that blood has the same red colour."" The BBC has less access to photojournalists reporting from Russia, as the Kremlin restricts access to international journalists and Russian news agencies are largely state-run. The BBC approached a Russia-based photographer to contribute to this story but received no response. In the above picture, Ermochenko captured jubilant pro-Russian activists on 21 February 2022 after Vladimir Putin declared their eastern region independent. It was published as part of the BBC's coverage of that fateful moment. He describes how the photo came about ""accidentally"" - a powerful reminder of the potential impact of a photographer's split-second decision to raise their camera. Ukraine said 300 people were killed when Russian planes bombed Mariupol theatre in March 2022. The following month, Alexander Ermochenko captured this image, featured in Hugo Bachega's report, in which the photographer conveys the aftermath of a massacre alongside everyday life. ""The destruction was absolute,"" he remembers, ""with destroyed nine-storey buildings looking like a Hollywood set. But they are real, and recently inhabited by people."" ""What was most surprising was that life continued, despite the fighting in neighbouring streets. People looked calm, but in fact they were deeply shocked by what was happening."" This photo, used in our live reporting of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant shelling in November 2022, illustrates the difficulty in photographing the war. ""Pictures of the plant were rare at that time,"" says Ermochenko. ""It is constantly under guard, though the soldiers themselves perfectly illustrate the situation."" Despite the challenges he and his colleagues face, he says ""the war is not only a part of my professional career, but a big part of my whole life... no matter how difficult it is, I will continue."" Based in Kyiv, Alina Smutko understands the human impact of this war through her work as a photojournalist and from personal experience. ""I've experienced Russian missiles and drone attacks on the city almost non-stop for three years. During this time, I've been constantly worried about my parents, child, friends and colleagues."" She feels lucky that her home is intact and her loved ones alive, after witnessing a missile attack on her neighbourhood from her bedroom window. Initially, she and her friends and family would check in with each other on a daily basis after the full-scale Russian invasion. But the frequency of attacks has forced residents to learn to live with the war and maintain as normal a life as possible. The toll on her profession has been hard. ""We see how our colleagues - photojournalists in particular - were killed or wounded during this invasion. We lost one of our team members, and another colleague has been badly wounded."" Smutko tries not to ""overthink"" what she does, but believes it is important to share the effects of the war with the world. ""I think it helps somehow, but I don't believe in the idea that a picture can stop a war. If it could, we would not have lost so many lives here."" ""I still believe that documenting is important. Because if something hasn't been photographed, it hasn't happened."" ""This work has to be done… I just do my best."" Top image shows a member of the emergency services attending a fire resulting from a Russian strike on a gas depot, near the border in north-eastern Sumy in May 2024."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yxd59p578o,Big challenges loom for Germany's Merz in divided country,2025-02-24T00:42:20.237Z,Jessica Parker,"Germany is at a crossroads and now for Friedrich Merz the hard work begins. The point of this election was never just about a nation's struggle to rediscover its economic mojo or re-evaluate its asylum policy – important as those issues absolutely are. It's also about Germany's ability to become the confident, world power that many of its allies want it to be. While there are capitals in Europe looking to Berlin for global leadership, within Germany, the priorities are often different. Merz will now need to balance those demands along with the inevitable compromises that come with coalition building. His promise to represent everyone comes amidst clear and stark divides in Germany. This election has again highlighted an east-west split, decades on from reunification. Voting data so far suggests that the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) is solidifying its dominance in the former communist east while the Christian Democrats (CDU-CSU) continue to prevail in much of Germany's south and west. An ARD exit poll shows 18 to 24-year-olds were most likely to back the left Die Linke party – followed by the AfD. An irony of this campaign has been that – of the four main parties – the one most guaranteed to not get power sucked up so much attention. AfD's rise is a central story of this election – and contemporary German politics. This is a party blocked from government because of a policy of non-cooperation with the far-right, known as the ""firewall"". Sections of the AfD have been classified as right-wing extremist by domestic intelligence. One of its most prominent figures, Bjorn Hocke, has been fined for using a banned Nazi-era slogan – Alles fur Deutschland. Eyebrows have been raised as some AfD supporters have reportedly since morphed the phrase into, ""Alice fur Deutschland"" – in reference to leader, Alice Weidel. Those people may suggest it's a finger up to an establishment that they think finds spurious excuses to smear them. Others worry that it's a sign of something far more sinister. The AfD has become ever-bolder, some might even argue reckless, in its rhetoric. On the campaign trail, we heard one AfD councillor – in a row with two men of colour – say: ""Go back to your Heimat (homeland) if you don't like this here."" He did so, as we were openly filming him – then flatly denied it was racist. Yet a stream of controversies hasn't stopped the AfD from enjoying its best ever result. In second place, it hasn't outperformed expectations but this still marks the strongest showing for a far-right party in post-war Germany. Already social media savvy, it has a powerful ally in tech billionaire Elon Musk who's openly endorsed the party. Many talk of 2025 as an inflection point for Germany. Either this could be the high watermark for the far-right – or the moment that will be remembered as the key stepping stone on its path to power. Much depends, say opponents of the AfD, on Germany's centrist politicians getting their act together and tackling voters' concerns. If they don't, the AfD will be a prime position to launch political attacks on the government as Germany's main opposition party. Frontwoman Alice Weidel has her eye on the next election as much as this one. And the 46-year-old's mission to make the AfD a more palatable political force appears to have been effective. Finally, let's not forget Olaf Scholz (even if many already have). His allies say that the outgoing chancellor had to play a difficult hand; in charge of an unwieldy three-way coalition, at a time of crisis – notably dealing with the fallout from Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. And Scholz may best be remembered for his Zeitenwende speech; a pledge – not fully delivered – to bring about a turning point in security and defence policy. A failure to deliver now – at home or abroad - could spell further danger for the parties that occupy Germany's political centre."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9vx01evp9o,Zelensky willing to give up presidency in exchange for Nato membership,2025-02-23T16:36:08.319Z,James Waterhouse Lucy Clarke-Billings and Vicky Wong,"Volodymyr Zelensky said he would be willing to ""give up"" his presidency in exchange for peace ahead of the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. ""If to achieve peace you really need me to give up my post – I'm ready. I can trade it for Nato membership, if there are such conditions,"" the Ukrainian president said in response to a question during a news conference. His comments came after US President Donald Trump called Zelensky a ""dictator without elections"" earlier in the week. ""I wasn't offended, but a dictator would be,"" Zelensky, who was democratically elected in May 2019, responded on Sunday.  ""I am focused on Ukraine's security today, not in 20 years, I am not going to be in power for decades,"" he added. According to Ukrainian law, elections are suspended under martial law, which has been in place since Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Zelensky is meeting Western leaders on Monday, some in person in Kyiv and some online, as they work out how to provide a post-war security where the US will not. He said the topic of Ukraine joining Nato would be ""on the table"" at the meeting but he did not know how the discussions would ""finish"". He hoped the meeting would be a ""turning point"". On the topic of Trump, Zelensky said that he wanted to see the US president as a partner to Ukraine and more than a mediator between Kyiv and Moscow. ""I really want it to be more than just mediation...that's not enough,"" he said. With the White House demanding that it gets access to billions of dollars' worth of Ukraine's natural minerals in exchange for the military aid it provided to date – and could in the future – Zelensky said US help so far had been agreed as grants, not loans. He said he would not agree to a security deal which – in his words – would be ""paid off by generation after generation"". When asked about a potential mineral deal, Zelensky said ""we are making progress,"" adding that Ukrainian and US officials had been in touch. ""We are ready to share,"" the Ukrainian leader said, but made clear that Washington first needed to ensure Russian President Vladimir Putin ""ends this war"". Zelensky appeared relaxed as he faced questions from the world's media. In previous years he had been more impassioned and even emotional, but on Sunday his approach was business-like. If Ukraine's leader rejects a Donald Trump-shaped peace proposal he does not agree with – as he suggested today – then it could have lasting consequences for the course of this war. Zelensky's comments came hours after Russia launched its largest single drone attack on Ukraine yet, Ukrainian officials said. On Saturday night, Ukraine's Air Force Command spokesman Yuriy Ignat said a ""record"" 267 Russian drones were launched in a single, coordinated attack on the country. Thirteen regions were targeted and while many of the drones were repelled, those that were not caused destruction to infrastructure and at least three casualties, emergency services said. Ukraine's Air Force reported that 138 of the drones were shot down and 119, which were decoy drones, were lost without negative consequences, likely due to jamming. In Kyiv, the attack meant six hours of air alerts. In a statement, Zelensky thanked Ukraine's emergency services for their response and called for the support of Europe and US in facilitating ""a lasting and just peace"". In a post on X, Ukraine's First Lady Olena Zelenska said that ""hundreds of drones"" had ""brought death and destruction"" overnight. ""It was another night of explosions, burning houses and cars, and destroyed infrastructure,"" she wrote. ""Another night when people prayed for their loved ones to survive"". On Monday, the war will enter its fourth year. Diplomatic wrangling over a potential peace deal continues, with Ukraine, European allies and the US offering differing visions for how to end the conflict. The US and Russia held preliminary talks in Saudi Arabia this week - without delegates from Europe, including Ukraine, present - which resulted in European leaders holding a hastily-arranged summit in Paris. Zelensky criticised Ukraine's exclusion from the US-Russia talks, saying Trump was ""living in a disinformation space"" governed by Moscow, prompting Trump to respond by calling the Ukrainian president a ""dictator"". French President Emmanuel Macron is expected to visit Washington on Monday, while UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer will be there on Thursday. Sir Keir has publicly backed Zelensky, reiterating the UK's ""ironclad support"" for Kyiv, and said he would discuss the importance of Ukraine's sovereignty when he speaks to Trump. Pope Francis - who is in hospital with respiratory illness - wrote in remarks released on Sunday that the third anniversary of the war was ""a painful and shameful occasion for the whole of humanity""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6yl0yqnmqo,French prisoner 'The Fly' arrested nine months after deadly van ambush,2025-02-23T15:04:02.390Z,Lucy Clarke-Billings,"A French convict who went on the run after escaping a police van in a deadly ambush has been arrested in Romania, French authorities have said. Two prison officers were killed and three others injured when a vehicle carrying Mohamed Amra was attacked by men using military-grade assault weapons in May 2024. Amra, known as La Mouche, or The Fly, has links to a major drug gang in Marseille, according to French police. President Emmanuel Macron hailed his capture as ""a formidable success"" and said his thoughts were with the families of the prison officers who died. Amra was arrested in Bucharest and had been identified through facial recognition tools and his fingerprints, Paris prosecutor Laure Beccuau said. He had changed his appearance and dyed his hair. On Sunday, Beccuau announced the arrest of 10 people ""suspected of having helped in the preparation and execution of the escape, and having helped the fugitive to hide"". Macron said he also wanted ""to thank our European colleagues and French investigators who had been hunting Mohamed Amra for months and months"". France's Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau thanked Romania for its ""crucial cooperation"". Amra escaped from a prison van after the vehicle was ambushed by gunmen at a toll booth at around 11:00 (09:00 GMT) on 14 May near Rouen, Normandy. Two prisoner officers were killed after the van was rammed and shots were fired. Three other officers were injured. The gunmen escaped in a car which police later found abandoned close to where the attack happened. The Paris prosecutor's office said Amra had been convicted of burglary by a court in Evreux on 10 May and was being held at a prison in Val-de-Reuil until his escape on 14 May. He had also been indicted by prosecutors in Marseille for a kidnapping that led to a death, it said. Amra was not a ""closely watched inmate"", Beccuau said at the time, using a term for highly dangerous prisoners. However, his transportation still reportedly required a ""level three escort"" which meant there were five prison officers travelling with him. His lawyer at the time, Hugues Vigier, said Amra had attempted to escape prison the weekend before the ambush by sawing the bars of his cell, but said he was shocked by the ""inexcusable"" and ""insane"" violence. ""This does not correspond to the impression that I had of him,"" the lawyer told BFMTV. At the time, Macron said ""everything"" was being done to find the perpetrators of the attack, which marked the first deaths of French prison officers in the line of duty since 1992. More than 300 investigators were assigned to track Amra down and roadblocks were set up across north-west France, according to police. ""After a manhunt lasting several months, Amra has been arrested, finally!"" Prime Minister Francois Bayrou wrote on X on Saturday."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd650yq0zdxo,Pope asks for prayers in message from hospital,2025-02-23T13:55:27.791Z,Vicky Wong Sarah Rainsford,"Pope Francis has asked Catholics to pray for him, as he continues to receive treatment in hospital for double pneumonia. The pontiff was unable to deliver the traditional Angelus prayer in person for the second Sunday running. But in a message written over the last few days, he said he was ""confidently continuing"" his hospitalisation at Rome's Gemelli Hospital and ""carrying on with the necessary treatment"". The message comes after the Vatican revealed on Saturday that the 88-year-old's condition continues to be ""critical"". In his message, released on Sunday, the Pope thanked the doctors and health workers at the hospital, and well-wishers who sent in messages. ""In recent days I have received many messages of affection, and I have been particularly struck by the letters and drawings from children,"" he wrote. ""Thank you for this closeness, and for the prayers of comfort I have received from all over the world! I entrust you all to the intercession of Mary, and I ask you to pray for me."" Well-wishers have continued to pray outside the hospital. Dozens of people have been seen lighting candles and leaving them at the foot of a nearby statue of the late Pope John Paul II. The 88-year-old was first admitted to hospital on 14 February after experiencing difficulties breathing for several days. He is especially prone to lung infections due to developing pleurisy - an inflammation around the lungs - as an adult and having part of one of his lungs removed at age 21. During his 12 years as leader of the Roman Catholic church, the Argentine has been admitted to hospital several times, including in March 2023 when he spent three nights in hospital with bronchitis. The Pope has asked for openness about his health, so the Vatican has started to release daily statements. The tone and length of the announcements has varied, sometimes leaving Pope-watchers to attempt to read between the lines. On Saturday, the Vatican said the Roman Catholic leader was alert and spent the day in an armchair, but that he was ""not out of danger"" and that he was ""more unwell"" than he was on Friday. They added the pontiff needed blood transfusions due to a low platelet count - associated with anaemia - and he required a ""high flow"" of oxygen. Doctors treating the Pope confirmed this week that he was responding to medication but his condition was complex and the slightest change of circumstance would upset what was called a ""delicate balance"". ""He is the Pope,"" as one of them put it. ""But he is also a man."" The Pope also used his message on Sunday to highlight the third anniversary of the war in Ukraine on Monday, and called on people to remember all victims of armed conflict and to ""pray for the gift of peace in Palestine, Israel and throughout the Middle East, Myanmar, Kivu and Sudan"". The Angelus prayer is usually delivered by the Pope from a window of the Apostolic Palace at the Vatican and is accompanied by a short message."

The pontiff was described as ""more unwell"" than on Friday and he has received blood transfusions as he suffers from a ""prolonged asthma-like respiratory crisis"". The 88-year-old is being treated for pneumonia in both lungs at the Gemelli Hospital in Rome. The blood transfusions were deemed necessary due to a low platelet count, associated with anaemia, the Vatican said. It said the Roman Catholic leader was alert and in his armchair, but required a ""high flow"" of oxygen and his prognosis ""remains guarded"". ""The Holy Father's condition remains critical,"" it said in a statement. ""The Pope is not out of danger."" It added: ""The Holy Father continues to be alert and spent the day in an armchair even if he was suffering more than yesterday."" The Pope has asked for openness about his health, so the Vatican has begun releasing daily statements. The tone and length of the announcements has varied, sometimes leaving Pope-watchers to attempt to read between the lines. But this is by far the starkest assessment yet and it is unusually detailed. It declines to give any prognosis. It comes just a day after doctors treating the Pope said for the first time that he was responding to medication, although they were clear that his condition was complex. They said on Friday that the slightest change of circumstance would upset what was called a ""delicate balance"". ""He is the Pope,"" as one of them put it. ""But he is also a man.""

The latest news will worry Catholics worldwide, who are following news of the Pope's condition closely. It is a busy Jubilee year for the Catholic Church with huge numbers of visitors expected in Rome and a major schedule of events for the Pope. He is not known for enjoying being inactive. Even in hospital, his doctors say he went to pray in the chapel this week and had been reading in his chair. But even before the latest setback, the Vatican had said he would not appear in public to lead prayer with pilgrims on Sunday, meaning he will miss the event for the second week in a row. Well-wishers have been leaving candles, flowers and letters for the Pope outside Rome's Gemelli hospital all week. There was no change outside St Peter's Basilica in the Vatican on Saturday evening, however, with no crowd gathering. But people passing through the square said they were following the news. ""We feel very close to the Pope, here in Rome,"" one Italian man told the BBC. ""We saw the latest, and we are worried."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyj93lz2kxo,Voting begins in high-stakes German election watched closely by Europe and US,2025-02-23T07:12:05.542Z,Paul Kirby,"Germans are going to the polls after an intense election campaign dominated by their country's faltering economy and a succession of deadly attacks that have made migration and security a focal issue. Friedrich Merz, the 69-year-old conservative leader, is in pole position to become Germany's next chancellor, in a vote closely watched in Europe and the US. He promises to fix most problems in four years - a tall order for Europe's biggest economy and a creaking infrastructure. If Merz's Christian Democrats (CDU) win, he will need to forge an alliance with at least one other party, most likely Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats, whose government collapsed late last year. On the eve of the vote, Merz was adamant there would be no deal with the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD), which is poised to become the second biggest political force, ahead of Scholz's centre-left party. Some 59.2 million Germans are eligible to vote, and while millions already have by post, polls indicate as many as 20% were undecided ahead of election day. The polls close at 18:00 (17:00 GMT) with a clear idea of a result likely to emerge during the evening. Voters are energised by this pivotal election, and campaigning continued right through Saturday evening with a final debate on national TV - the ninth this month. This is a watershed moment as Germany will have to make big decisions on the world stage as well as at home. Merz promises strong leadership in Europe, but Berlin is also under pressure to loosen the budget strings for its military. As Ukraine's second-biggest provider of military aid, Germany's next government will face a US president who has condemned President Volodymyr Zelensky as a dictator and fractured the West's united front against Russia. German political leaders have also been shocked by US Vice-President JD Vance, who has met the AfD's candidate for chancellor, Alice Weidel, and called for an end to the long-standing taboo of talking to the far-right. In Germany, that taboo is known as a firewall or brandmauer. Merz was accused of breaking it last month when he used their support in parliament. There were protests against the far-right in several German cities on Saturday. The AfD is already popular in several eastern states, but is rapidly growing in the west too, attracting support among younger Germans via TikTok. One Weidel campaign video has had four million views. Her message is simple: Vote AfD, break the firewall and change German politics. The AfD wants a vote on leaving the EU if it can’t reform it, to scrap climate change measures, build nuclear power plants, and repair gas lines and relations with Russia. Find out more about Germany's elections: Who's who and what you need to know Merz: Risk-taker who flirted with far right Katya Adler: Far right looks for breakthrough as Germany falters Tensions laid bare as Germans worry about immigration But its voice has been loudest on migration and security after five deadly attacks since last May, including three during the election campaign in Magdeburg, Aschaffenburg and Munich - all allegedly carried out by immigrants. A stabbing at Berlin's Holocaust memorial on Friday night has kept the issue in the headlines. The victim survived, and police said the attacker was Syrian and his motive antisemitic. The AfD has embraced a highly controversial policy called ""remigration"", which it defines as deporting migrants who have committed crimes. But the term can also refer to the mass deportation of migrants and their descendants. The anti-immigration party has already secured a foothold in parts of the west, especially in Germany's old industrial heartland in the Ruhr valley. In last summer's European elections it won the vote in some northern areas of the city of Duisburg, with 20% in Marxloh, 25% in an adjacent area and 30% next door to that. Marxloh is a vibrant district with a large immigrant community, known for its array of shops selling Turkish fashionwear for brides. But it has also suffered extensively from the decline of the coal and steel industry and a lack of government investment. In a park close to Marxloh's remaining steelworks, five young men in their early 20s explained why they all planned to vote AfD. ""We're young, we need work and they don't give us a chance to find training,"" one man complained. ""We've no money; everything's more expensive; there aren't many jobs any more and there's so much dirt here."" The AfD is not known for its social policies, but its message on security cuts through, and this group does not see the anti-immigration party as extreme. ""No, they're just normal people."" In the east, it is in the rural areas where the AfD does best, but in the west it is growing in cities that have lost their industrial base, says Prof Conrad Ziller of the University of Duisburg-Essen. ""Voices of people in favour of the AfD have become so loud, so if you're in a doctor's waiting room it's really common to hear people chat about getting angry about the established politicians and government."" Migration is the most common frustration, and he believes Weidel has capitalised on that by appearing so prominently in all the TV debates. Often when the debate touched on the economy, social justice or inequality, Prof Ziller said ""the AfD deflected it and said the main problem is not economics, it's migration, and the government didn't do a good job"". While the opinion polls have been consistent about who is leading the race, some of the parties might not make it over the 5% threshold for the newly slimmed-down parliament. If fewer parties make it into the 630-seat Bundestag, it will be more straightforward to form a coalition with a majority. The economic liberals, the Free Democratic Party (FDP), were in the outgoing government but risk oblivion on Sunday along with left-wing populist party BSW. The Left party, however, has seen a resurgence in recent days and pollsters suggest it will become the fifth largest party after the Greens."

A 37-year-old Algerian man was arrested at the scene and the prosecutor has opened a terrorist inquiry because the suspect reportedly shouted ""Allahu Akbar"", or ""God is great"". The man injured two police officers seriously, one in the neck and one in the chest. A 69-year-old Portuguese man who tried to intervene was stabbed and killed. The suspect was subject to a deportation order because he was on a terrorism watch list, according to the local prosecutor. President Emmanuel Macron said there was ""no doubt it was an Islamist terrorist attack"". After expressing his condolences to the family of the victim, Macron added: ""I want to reiterate the determination of the government, and mine, to continue the work to eradicate terrorism on our soil."" The attack took place at about 16:00 local time (15:00 GMT) on Saturday near a busy market in Mulhouse, which is close to the borders with Germany and Switzerland. The police officers were on patrol at a demonstration taking place in support of the Democratic Republic of Congo. ""I have lived in France for 41 years and I have never experienced something like this,"" Cemalettin Canak, 55, told the Reuters news agency. ""It has shocked me a lot,"" he added. ""Now when I go to the market, I will be a little nervous."" Of the two officers taken to hospital, the one injured to the chest was later discharged, prosecutors told the AFP news agency, while three others suffered minor injuries. ""Horror has seized our city,"" Mulhouse mayor Michele Lutz wrote on Facebook. French Prime Minister François Bayrou posted on X that ""fanaticism has struck again and we are in mourning"". ""My thoughts naturally go to the victims and their families, with the firm hope that the injured will recover,"" he said. Visiting the scene on Saturday evening, Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau told broadcaster TF1 that the suspect had been found to have a ""schizophrenic profile"" following his arrest. He also said France had attempted to expel the suspect 10 times, and each time Algeria had refused to accept him. He called for the establishment of a new ""balance of power"" with Algeria, and told reporters ""we must change the rules"" on how detention centres operate. There was no immediate public comment from Algeria in response. Additional reporting by Tom Bennett and Rorey Bosotti"

The UK prime minister reiterated the UK's ""ironclad support"" for Kyiv when he spoke to Volodymyr Zelensky on Saturday. The two leaders held their second telephone conversation in four days following US President Trump's decision to re-open relations with Russia and seek an end to the war in Ukraine. Monday marks three years since Vladimir Putin's invasion, which UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said he will mark with further sanctions on Russia. On Saturday, 2,000 people marched to the Russian embassy in west London , i n support of Ukraine ahead of the anniversary of the invasion. According to a Downing Street spokesperson the prime minister also said ""Ukraine must be at the heart of any negotiations to end the war"" and it could be sure of ""the UK's commitment to securing a just and enduring peace to bring an end to Russia's illegal war"". Giving details about the phone call, Downing Street said Sir Keir and Zelensky ""agreed that this was a significant moment for the future of Ukraine and European security at large"". Sir Keir also told Zelensky ""that safeguarding Ukraine's sovereignty was essential to deter future aggression from Russia"". The prime minister added ""he would be progressing these important discussions in the coming days and weeks, including with Trump whilst visiting Washington DC next week"". Zelensky said he had a productive talk with Sir Keir, with the pair coordinating ""our military cooperation, joint steps, and engagements for the coming week, which will be very active"". In a post on X, he wrote: ""The UK and its people are among Ukraine's biggest supporters, and we deeply appreciate this."" Writing in the Sun Sir Keir said Trump was right that European nations must take greater responsibility for their security and increase defence spending. ""We have talked about this for long enough. Now it is time for action. ""President Trump is also right to grasp the nettle and see if a good peace deal is on the table. ""Every time I have spoken with him, I am struck by his commitment to peace,"" he wrote. Sir Keir also said Ukraine must have a voice in negotiations and needed strong security guarantees, adding: ""I believe America must be part of that guarantee.""  In a separate call on Saturday Sir Keir spoke with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and they agreed Europe ""must step up for the good of collective European security"", Downing Street said. The UK foreign secretary said upcoming additional UK sanctions on Russia would erode President Putin's ""military machine"". ""I plan to announce the largest package of sanctions against Russia since the early days of the war,"" Lammy said, ahead of Monday's anniversary. The UK will continue to work with the US and Europe to achieve ""sustainable, just peace,"" he added. Sir Keir's meeting with Trump on Thursday in Washington DC comes after a week which saw a flurry of summits and phone calls as European leaders scrambled to work out how to approach the US president's sudden thawing of relations with Russia. Ahead of visits to the White House by Sir Keir and French President Emmanuel Macron, Trump said the pair ""haven't done anything"" to end the war in Ukraine. He also said Zelensky had ""no cards"" in peace negotiations and that he did not think ""he's very important to be in meetings"". But UK Defence Secretary John Healey wrote in The Sunday Times newspaper: ""Any negotiations about Ukraine cannot happen without Ukraine. We all want the fighting to end, but an insecure peace risks more war."" He added: ""I'm proud of UK leadership and UK unity on Ukraine."" Last Monday, European leaders held a hastily-arranged summit in Paris - a day before US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia, and amid fears that Ukraine and Europe could be excluded from peace negotiations. On Tuesday, Trump called Zelensky a ""dictator"" and said he should ""never have started"" the war, despite Russia invading Ukraine. Zelensky responded by saying the US president was ""living in a disinformation space"" created by Russia. On Saturday, people took to the streets of London in response to the US position on Ukraine, marching from outside the Ukrainian embassy to the Russian embassy. Margaret Owen, 93, accused Trump of ""appeasement"", saying she remembered the Munich Agreement in which western powers signed a deal with Hitler in the years before World War Two. ""It's outrageous. We can't let the world be dictated to by these two impossible people,"" she said of Trump and Putin. The chair of the Commons foreign affairs select committee, Emily Thornberry, was among the marchers and argued for a less aggressive approach. The Labour MP said: ""We want to influence the US president and we agree there must be peace. Why shout at him? ""You'd get a short-term buzz from shouting at Trump but if you want to influence him, let's try and influence him."" ""Ukraine needs to be at the table, you can't decide the future of Ukraine without Ukraine there and you can't just capitulate to Putin. ""They have to be invited into this process by the Americans and Russians."" Ukrainian Oleksandra Udovenko, who is from Kyiv and studying in the UK, said: ""I'm here to protect my country's interests, my country's independence, and my country's choice and my country's right to be independent of any empire in this world."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgkm7lly61do,Invisible Losses: Tens of thousands fighting for Russia are dying unnoticed on the frontline in Ukraine,2025-02-23T01:24:37.377Z,Olga Ivshina,"Over 95,000 people fighting for Russia's military have now died as the war in Ukraine enters the fourth year, according to data analysed by the BBC. This figure doesn't include those who were killed serving in the militia of the self-proclaimed Donbas republics which we estimate to be between 21,000 and 23,500 fighters. BBC Russian, independent media group Mediazona and volunteers have been counting deaths since February 2022. The list includes names of the deceased that we verified using information from official reports, newspapers, social media, and new memorials and graves. The real death toll is believed to be much higher. Daniil Dudnikov, a 21-year-old history student at Donetsk National University, was reading international relations and enjoyed swimming. On the first day of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine, on 24 February 2022, the authorities in the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic forcibly mobilised Daniil and despatched him to the Kharkiv region. Just a month later, on 25 March, Daniil went missing in action. Of the 18 soldiers in his unit, none returned. 13 were killed, and five were taken prisoner. Four months later, following a prisoner exchange, those who had survived confirmed that Daniil had been one of the 13 killed in combat. Daniil's story mirrors those of thousands of other residents from the self-declared Donetsk and Luhansk People's Republics, created in 2014 by Moscow-backed separatists in the predominantly Russian-speaking parts of eastern Ukraine. With the full-scale Russian invasion in 2022, civilian men were drafted en masse, often inadequately trained and poorly equipped before being assigned to near-impossible missions. This resulted in a staggering number of dead and missing soldiers, the fate of whom often remains unknown for months or years. According to our analysis of published obituaries and missing persons reports from the regions, the majority of deaths in Donbass militias occurred during the first year of the invasion, a toll comparable to the total number of confirmed Russian military losses over the same period - 25,769 deaths. Yet despite many people in the occupied parts of eastern Ukraine having relatives or friends in Russia, they are far less integrated into the country's everyday life, which makes their losses less ""visible"" to ordinary Russians. Another large part of the Russian losses are convicts recruited in prisons. Ildus Sadykov was 59 when he was arrested for stealing a bag at a railway station in Moscow. It was the fourth time he ended up in jail, having spent a total of 16 years behind bars for separate criminal convictions. ""They told me, 'If you don't want to go back to prison, sign a contract.' They assured me that at my age, I wouldn't be sent to the front, just assigned to an auxiliary role. Well, I went along with it."" He recalls, speaking as a prisoner of war after being captured by Ukrainian forces in the summer of 2024. Following a prisoner exchange, he was returned to Russia, where he was sent back to the frontlines again. This month, Ildus Sadykov was killed in combat. Currently, the BBC Russian database of war casualties includes 16,171 convicted criminals who were recruited from penal colonies to fight. These are just the cases in which we could verify criminal records through open sources. The actual number of deceased convicts is likely far higher. By including an analysis of leaked documents from the Wagner Group private military company, we can estimate that prisoners may make up as much as a third of Russia's military fatalities over the three years of the invasion. Many of these individuals lived in correctional facilities, effectively cut off from broader society, for years on end. ""The losses are felt most by segments of Russian society with fewer resources, be they educational, financial, or political,"" says Gulnaz Sharafutdinova, director of the Russia Institute at King's College London. ""The Kremlin seems to have designed it this way, ensuring that the most privileged sections of society remain largely disconnected from the war. Hence recruitment of prisoners and foreign mercenaries."" ""In small towns, people are far more aware of the scale of casualties. The war has hit social groups that lack the means not only to protest but even to express their views openly. Discussions are confined to private conversations,"" she adds. Only 30% of Russians have had direct exposure to the war, either by fighting in it or family connections to combatants, according to a public opinion poll from the Chronicles project in September 2024. The proportion of Ukrainians who know someone killed or wounded is almost 80%. Measuring genuine support for the war in Russia is difficult, since many respondents fear speaking honestly. But a study commissioned by the PROPA project, supported by the University of Helsinki, found that 43% of surveyed Russians openly backed the invasion. ""Would public attitudes toward the war be different if more people personally knew the fallen?"" asks leading Russian sociologist Viktor Vakhshtayn. ""Without a doubt."" Russia's actual losses are almost certainly substantially higher than open-source data can reveal. The military analysts we have consulted estimate that the BBC's research, which is based on graveyards, war memorials, and obituaries, probably captures only 45% to 65% of total casualties. Added to which, the bodies of many of those killed in recent months likely remain on the battlefield, since retrieving them requires living soldiers to risk exposure to drone strikes. Given the estimate above, the true number of Russian military deaths could range from 146,194 to 211,169. If one adds estimated losses from DPR and LPR forces, the total number of Russian-aligned fatalities may range from 167,194 to 234,669. Russia last officially reported its military losses in September 2022, and cited fewer than 6,000 deaths. Ukraine last updated its casualty figures in December 2024, when President Volodymyr Zelensky acknowledged 43,000 Ukrainian deaths among soldiers and officers. Western analysts believe this figure to be an under-estimate. The website Ukraine Losses, which compiles casualty data from open sources, currently lists more than 70,400 surnames of Ukrainian soldiers. Our verification of a random sample of 400 of them found the database to be reliable. The Ukrainian casualty list is likely more complete than the Russian equivalent, as Ukrainian presidential decrees on posthumous military awards remain publicly accessible. In Russia such data is classified. As the war approaches its fourth year, global attention has shifted to the new U.S. administration's push for peace negotiations. We continue to monitor activity at Russian military cemeteries and war memorials, and analyse obituaries, which have surged sharply in number since September last year."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9deyw95xzzo,He dreamed of a cycling revolution. Then an SUV crushed him,2025-02-23T00:28:25.564Z,Anna Holligan,"Cycling rates in Paris have soared in recent years. But the death of 27-year-old Paul Varry - who was allegedly run over by a driver - has exposed a darker side to Paris's cycling revolution. ""This was not an accident,"" Paul's colleague Corentin believes. We're standing on the edge of a bike lane on Boulevard Malesherbes, steps away from the place where Paul was crushed by an SUV on 15 October 2024. The moments preceding his death are subject to a criminal investigation. Paul was cycling home from work. The cycle path is separated from the road by a slightly raised kerb. According to witnesses and CCTV, the driver of the SUV began driving in the bike lane. Prosecutors say the driver ran over Paul's foot. Paul banged his fist on the bonnet. The motorist reversed at first, but then allegedly drove towards the 27-year-old. An autopsy confirmed ""the marks of the vehicle crossing his body"". The 52-year-old driver has been charged with murder. His lawyer says he may have lost control of the vehicle in a stressful situation that he was trying to get out of. At a hearing attended by news agency AFP, he broke into tears and said ""I'm sorry for what happened. I never meant to run him over."" Paris has seen a surge in cycling as part of a broader transformation spearheaded by Mayor Anne Hidalgo. Over the last decade, the city has invested €400m (£331m) in cycling infrastructure, creating more than 1,000 kilometres of bike lanes. According to a recent study, cycling now makes up more than 11% of trips within Paris, compared to just 4% by car. Walking is still the most popular way of getting around - accounting for 53% of journeys, followed by public transport (30%). But despite the investment, cycling in Paris still feels precarious. Bike lanes are patchy, lack uniformity and often don't have designated traffic lights. The rules surrounding right of way aren't always clear and are often flouted, making it difficult for cyclists to safely navigate. Paul Varry's death was extreme, but it resonated and has become a symbol of the daily struggle for space on the streets of Paris. His mother, Nathalie Tison, remembers her son as a carefree spirit who embraced the freedom of cycling. ""He was a very happy and very bubbly person, he had a lovely sense of humour and was always very gentle with the people around him. It's such an injustice because he didn't deserve at all what happened."" She told me she had always been concerned about the dangers of her son riding in Paris, where she detected a sense of entitlement among some drivers. ""Drivers can be super aggressive - nothing can get in their way,"" she said. ""For some, the car is an extension of their virility and if anyone touches their car… it's taken as a personal attack. ""I was afraid for him."" Paul understood these risks, and was an active member of the cycling group Paris en Selle - Paris in the Saddle. He campaigned for more segregated space for bicycles and safer junctions. Advocates hope the progress made in Paris will continue. Rémi Féraud, a socialist senator and Anne Hidalgo's top choice for future mayor, doesn't dream of a car-free future, ""because there are Parisians who have cars"". ""But by reducing space for the car, we reserve it for those who really need to come by car,"" he says. ""We want a city that is 100% cyclable… It is an offer of freedom."" Carving out more street space for cyclists has involved restricting space for cars. The number of parking spaces in Paris have been slashed by a half and certain vehicles have been banned from driving through the city. Some drivers, particularly those from the suburbs, feel that the city's car reduction policies have made their lives more difficult. ""Driving in Paris is like going to war,"" says Shamy, a reserved 24-year-old midwife. ""There are no rules."" I'm sitting in his car as he straddles a cycle path - he can't reverse because people are walking there and in front of us cars are bumper to bumper. What does he do if there's a confrontation with a cyclist? ""I just say sorry."" Shamy lets me out as we approach a zone in the city centre where through-traffic has been outlawed - one of several measures that has drawn anger from business owners. Patrick Aboukrat, who owns a fashion boutique in the Marais shopping district, has launched a lawsuit with other members of Comité Marais Paris, the business association he leads, to try to roll back some of the new rules. He says they're losing customers and that some were planning on selling up. ""When young people say they want to open a shop, I say 'open a shop in the suburbs, go outside of Paris.' ""We do understand the need to have fewer cars in the centre. I say to the Mayor we want to work together, to change the plan. But they don't listen. It's ideological. "" But Féraud, the senator, instead suggests the rise in online shopping is to blame. According to polls, most of those who live within the main Paris ring road - of whom only 30% own a car - don't mind the traffic-limiting measures. Those on the outskirts tend to drive more, but they are not eligible to vote for the Paris mayor or influence its traffic polices. Alexandra Legendre, who represents a motorists lobby group - the Drivers' Defence League - says ""no one [drives] for pleasure in Paris, it's hell."" She feels authorities have prioritised cyclists at the expense of everyone else. She accuses politicians of being blinkered by a desire to transform Paris into a cyclists' paradise - ignoring road safety. She insists car drivers can't be treated as ""the only bad guys"". There's a consensus that Paul Varry's death was a tragedy, but Ms Legendre doesn't think it had anything to do with him being a cyclist. Paris is navigating the challenges of its cycling revolution as European capitals are under pressure to curb transport-related carbon emissions. The EU's green deal aims to achieve a 90% reduction in transport-related greenhouse gas emissions by 2050. Corentin, Paul's colleague, points out that while Paris is still far from perfect, the infrastructure has improved significantly, making it easier and safer than ever to enjoy the view. ""We are in one of the most beautiful cities in the world, and there is no better way to see it than by bike."" The constant stream of cyclists buzzing down Rue de Rivoli - which was a major highway until 2020 - suggests that the shift towards bike-friendly urban spaces is irreversible. Paul's mother hopes the safe transformation of Paris streets will be part of her son's legacy. No date has yet been set for the trial. When it finally comes around, she will come face to face with the man who is accused of causing her son's death for the first time. He is a father of four, the authorities told her. Two families, she points out, have been ""broken"". She believes the way Paul lived and died must be a catalyst for change. ""He was so bright, intelligent, sensitive - it's such a waste. And we've been reduced to a thousand pieces. We have to ask ourselves, what kind of society do we want to live in?"""

The attack took place on Friday evening, with the assailant approaching the 30-year-old victim from behind before stabbing him and fleeing the scene. A man was arrested nearby after police noticed blood stains on his hands and clothing. The suspect was carrying a prayer rug, a copy of the Quran, and the suspected weapon in his backpack, suggesting ""a religious motivation"", police said. After being taken to hospital with serious wounds to his neck, the victim underwent an operation and was put into an induced coma, but his life is no longer in danger. Police say they are examining possible connections to the current Middle East conflict - but said there is currently no evidence of links to any groups or individuals. They are also investigating whether the suspect is suffering from mental illness. He had no prior criminal record and was not known to the police, they added. Six people who witnessed the attack are receiving counselling from local authorities. German Interior Minister Nancy Faeser described the attack as an ""abhorrent and brutal crime"" for which the suspect ""must be punished with the full force of the law"". ""We will use all means to deport violent offenders back to Syria,"" she said. Several stabbing and car-ramming attacks have taken place in Germany in recent months, in the cities of Mannheim, Solingen, Magdeburg, Aschaffenburg and Munich. All of the alleged attackers were migrants. Immigration has become a core issue for voters ahead of federal elections taking place on Sunday. The Berlin Holocaust memorial was opened in 2005 to commemorate the six million Jews of Europe murdered by the Nazi regime, and comprises 2,711 stone slabs. Hours after the attack in the German capital, Swedish police said they had apprehended three men near the Israeli Embassy in Stockholm, on suspicion of preparing to commit violent crime. It is not believed the incidents are linked."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kgd25710do,Final push for votes as German frontrunner vows to lead in Europe,2025-02-22T12:58:25.243Z,Paul Kirby,"Germany's rival political leaders will take their fight for votes right to the last minute in a push that reflects the pivotal nature of Sunday's election, not just for their country but for Europe as a whole. Conservative frontrunner Friedrich Merz told supporters that under his leadership, Germany would take responsibility in Europe, and that the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) would be consigned to the political margins once more. He will end his Christian Democrat party's campaign with a rally in Munich, while his rivals will make a final appeal in a TV ""speed-dating"" programme with voters. For months German politics has been paralysed by the collapse of the previous government. Now, hopes have been raised across Europe that this vote will bring some certainty to the EU's biggest democracy and its biggest economy, which has struggled to escape from lingering recession. Nothing will change overnight. No party can govern without forming a coalition, and that will take weeks. Reviving the economy has been one of the two big issues of the campaign; the other has been migration and security, thrust on Germany's politicians by a series of deadly attacks since May 2024. The cities of Mannheim, Solingen, Magdeburg, Aschaffenburg and Munich have all suffered grievous attacks. A Spanish tourist was stabbed at the Holocaust memorial in the centre of Berlin on Friday night, although his wounds are not considered life-threatening. All the alleged attackers were immigrants, and the AfD under Alice Weidel has advanced to about 20% in the polls with its nationalist, anti-immigration message. She has appealed to younger voters on social media, and is far ahead in the race on TikTok, with 870,000 followers. She has also been buoyed by support from both billionaire Elon Musk and US Vice-President JD Vance, who has been accused of meddling in the German campaign. The AfD talks of securing Germany's borders and deporting migrants who came illegally and committed crimes. But she uses the word ""remigration"" which has also been linked to mass deportations. In Solingen, where a Syrian was accused of stabbing to death three people last August, hundreds of people turned out on Friday night to speak out against the rise of the far right. ""We have a lot of friends who grew up in Germany whose parents did not,"" said one woman called Natalie, 35. ""We don't want anybody to kick them out and we don't want our borders closed."" One man called Jochen held up a sign that read ""Never Again is Now!"" There was a large police presence at the protest, and Friday night's stabbing in Berlin which police say was motivated by antisemitism has heightened security fears. A police union spokesman has warned of a risk of attacks aimed at destabilising democracy. All the mainstream parties have ruled out working with the AfD in government, but if it polls higher than 20% it could double its number of seats to 150 in the 630-seat parliament. Merz's most likely partner is Chancellor Olaf Scholz's Social Democrats, although probably without Scholz himself. The message from his centre-left SPD as the final day of campaigning began was that every vote counts, and if Germans wanted a strong government they needed a strong SPD. The Social Democrats are languishing in third in the polls, but Scholz is pinning his hopes on an estimated one in five undecided voters who could make a big difference. Friedrich Merz was in a relaxed and confident mood when he appeared on stage this week in front of 1,200 supporters in the tech-hub city of Darmstadt near Frankfurt. But his message was stark as he turned his thoughts to Donald Trump's presidency. One hand in his pocket and the other holding the microphone, he spoke of unprecedented times and a ""tectonic shift in the world's centres of power"". ""A political order is now crumbling. What we have become used to for decades is breaking down."" He was not even sure if the US would join Germany in celebrating the 70th year of its accession to Nato in the summer. He castigated the outgoing government for failing to take a leading role on the international stage. ""The German government and chancellor must finally take on a leading role in Europe again. If I'm elected I will spend a significant part of my time keeping this European Union together."" Find out more about Germany's elections: Who's who and what you need to know Merz: Risk-taker who flirted with far right Katya Adler: Far right looks for breakthrough as Germany falters Tensions laid bare as Germans worry about immigration Germans have had almost nightly opportunities to see their political leaders thrash out the big issues in TV debates, and Alice Weidel has been in the thick of them, sharing the stage with both Merz and Scholz. In the run-up to the vote she met Vice-President JD Vance, who castigated German politicians for raising a ""firewall"" against the far right and of ignoring ""the will of the voters"". That firewall - brandmauer in German - has held strong since the end of the war, although Merz himself was accused of breaking it when he relied on the support of the AfD last month in a motion on migration. He has faced demonstrations ever since, and there was a noisy protest when he visited Darmstadt. PhD student Annika, 29, held a Herz statt Merz banner - love instead of Merz. ""He says he won't do something with the far-right AfD, but his actions contradict what he says. I don't trust him at all."" Merz appears to have been stung by the outcry and has sought to reassure voters there will be ""no tolerance, no minority government [with the AfD], nothing at all""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5ynv58y8yo,Who's who in German elections and why this vote is important,2025-02-22T12:34:10.123Z,Paul Kirby,"German voters decide on Sunday who will run their next government, with Friedrich Merz's conservative Christian Democrats favourite to become the biggest party in power. Reviving the European Union's biggest economy as well as immigration and security are the main issues in this snap election, triggered by the collapse of centre-left Chancellor Olaf Scholz's coalition late last year. We assess what and who you need to know ahead of the vote for Germany's next parliament, the Bundestag. After months of political deadlock and at a time of global uncertainty, Germans and their European allies are looking to this election to provide clear leadership and direction, as faith in their longstanding US alliance wanes. At home, Germany's faltering powerhouse economy is crying out for an overhaul after two years of recession - buffeted by high energy prices prompted by Russia's war in Ukraine and stiff Chinese competition. A series of deadly attacks has heightened pressure for reform to immigration and asylum rules. Immigrants have been accused of carrying out three fatal attacks during the election campaign - in Magdeburg, Aschaffenburg and Munich. Security fears and rising discontent with politicians have propelled the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party into an expected second place. If the AfD double their seats in parliament, it would present a challenge to the longstanding firewall - brandmauer - that has so far blocked the mainstream parties from working with them. More than 59 million Germans aged 18 and over are eligible to take part in this vote for their next parliament. Voting takes place between 08:00-18:00 (07:00-17:00 GMT) on Sunday, although millions of postal votes have already been cast. The result will become clear during the evening. There are five candidates for chancellor. If the biggest party can secure a coalition deal with one or two other parties, the president will usually nominate its leader as chancellor. Then parliament will hold a secret ballot to decide. The frontrunner in the race to run Germany is Friedrich Merz, whose Christian Democrats (CDU) are up to 10 points ahead in the polls. He was chosen as candidate for chancellor ahead of Markus Söder, the leader of their sister party in Bavaria the Christian Social Union. Aged 69 and 198cm (6ft 6in) in height, Merz is a plain-talking, pro-business, social conservative who has spent years waiting in the wings. Eclipsed in the CDU by Angela Merkel in 2002, he eventually left politics, served on the boards of investment banks and took up flying as an amateur pilot. Merz's first two bids to win the CDU leadership failed, against Merkel in 2018 and then Armin Laschet who went on to lose the German election in 2021. Merz then took over the CDU and is running under the slogan ""A Germany we can be proud of again"". He has promised permanent border controls and faster asylum rules to restrict immigration, and to cut taxes and slash €50bn in welfare spending in a bid to kickstart Germany's faltering economy. He has also promised to bolster aid for Ukraine. But he provoked a furious backlash ahead of the election when he sought to tighten immigration rules by relying on the votes of the far-right AfD, and he ultimately failed. Although Merz has ruled out working with the AfD, former CDU chancellor Angela Merkel said he was ""wrong"" to accept AfD votes and he has faced big protests. He has also promised greater leadership from Germany in Europe, and beefed-up support for Ukraine, refusing to rule out future membership of Nato. Olaf Scholz has already served more than three years as chancellor, at the head of an unpopular coalition that fell apart in a row over loosening Germany's strict debt rules. His government struggled from the start, largely because of the effect of Russia's full-scale war in Ukraine on Germany's economy. Germany became Ukraine's biggest aid-provider in Europe. Scholz spoke of a Zeitenwende (turning point) in boosting German defence policy and military spending - but he was accused of acting too slowly or too late. He now promises European support for Ukraine ""for as long as necessary"" and rejects the idea of any dictated peace. Scholz has backed faster deportation of failed asylum seekers and his government reimposed border checks which he says have brought asylum requests down by a third in one year. Scholz's Social Democrats (SPD) want to establish a ""Germany fund"" to boost investment and to raise the minimum wage to €15 (£12.50) an hour from €12.82. Many in the party believed he should have allowed colleague Boris Pistorius to run for chancellor instead. However, the SPD has joined conservatives in the past and although Scholz said he could no longer trust Merz, the Social Democrats remain potential partners. Alice Weidel, 46, is the first AfD candidate for chancellor since the party was created in 2013. She has also basked in the support of billionaire Elon Musk, and was rewarded with a meeting with US Vice-President JD Vance during his visit to Munich. Weidel has little chance of winning power, but she has become popular with young voters on TikTok, amassing more than 870,00 followers, and she has reached far more of the population with repeated appearances in TV election debates. Co-led by Tino Chrupalla, the AfD has already secured one recent victory, in September's state election in Thuringia in the east. And while he and Weidel hope for big advances, their main aim is to pave the way for even greater success in four years' time. Elon Musk said the ex-Goldman Sachs analyst could not be a right-wing extremist as she ""has a same-sex partner from Sri Lanka"". And yet she has backed the mass deportation of migrants, embracing the highly controversial term ""remigration"" - which she defines as deporting criminals and ""illegal"" migrants. She also wants to end sanctions on Russia, repairing the destroyed Nord Stream gas pipelines; and she wants to tear down wind turbines, which she calls ""windmills of shame"", even though they now provide a quarter of Germany's electricity. Party supporters have cheered her with the slogan Alice für Deutschland (Alice for Germany), which sounds similar to a banned Nazi slogan Alles für Deutschland. Robert Habeck's Greens played a key role in the Scholz government as vice-chancellor and economy minister. But one of his flagship policies, phasing out fossil-fuel heating systems in Germany, had to be watered down and led to a dive in the government's poll ratings. He rejects any return to nuclear energy, and calls for more affordable access to renewable energy which by the end of last year supplied 63.4% of Germany's electricity needs. Habeck, 55, has taken a strong line on aid for Ukraine, and he has forcefully criticised Friedrich Merz for relying on votes from the AfD in parliament. Relations with Merz are awkward, after he accused the CDU leader of disqualifying himself as chancellor and Merz has described Halbeck as a ""representative for heat pumps"". Like Alice Weidel's AfD, Sahra Wagenknecht and her BSW party back closer relations with Russia and has built a strong support base in eastern Germany. Wagenknecht calls her politics ""left conservativism"" and presents herself as an alternative to the AfD, backing strict limits on asylum and immigration. She shares the AfD's opposition to German military support for Ukraine and has been accused of parroting Kremlin narratives on the war. But she may struggle to reach the 5% national threshold to get into parliament. Elections to the Bundestag usually take place every four years - this one had been due on 28 September 2025 but was brought forward because of the collapse of the Scholz government. Over-18s get two votes, which will decide who sits in the Bundestag, now slimmed down from 733 seats to 630. One vote is to elect members of the Bundestag directly in 299 constituencies. The second is to choose a political party in one of the 16 states that you live in. Any party that wins 5% of that second vote is allowed to enter the Bundestag, and they then use their state lists to pick their MPs. Complex rules on allocating seats have been abolished, but the new rules mean some candidates who win their local races may lose out, if their parties do not do as well in the state as a whole. One of the old rules will remain. Any party that fails to poll 5% of the vote can still get in, if they win in three of the 299 constituencies. The conservative CDU and CSU parties are favourite to win the most seats, but by ruling out a coalition with the AfD, Merz has narrowed their options of potential partners in government. That makes a deal most likely with the Social Democrats. Many in the SPD are reluctant to work with Merz after last month's migration row, but a so-called grand coalition of the two parties is still on the cards. If they fail to secure more than half the seats in the Bundestag between them for an absolute majority, they may need a third party, most likely the Greens."

Made of white Carrara marble, it depicts the pontiff in his later years, stooping and clutching a crucifix, his brow furrowed in pain. Doctors at the Gemelli hospital helped save John Paul's life, after he was shot in a failed assassination attempt in St Peter's Square in May 1981. He underwent a six-hour operation to remove a bullet from his abdomen. It was the first time a Pope had been treated at Rome's largest hospital. Among the hospital's current patients is Pope Francis, who was admitted last week with a respiratory infection. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. Over the course of his 25 year-long pontificate, John Paul was admitted around 10 times, sometimes for prolonged stays. He received treatment for various illnesses, including a benign intestinal tumour, a broken hip and a tracheotomy, when his Parkinson's disease was at an advanced stage. The Gemelli, which is a Catholic teaching hospital, opened in the 1960s. With more than 1500 beds, it is one of the biggest private hospitals in Europe. Built on land donated by Pope Pius XI to the theologian and physician Agostino Gemelli in 1934, it has become known as the ""Pope's Hospital."" John Paul II even nicknamed it ""Vatican Three,"" with St Peter's Square being Vatican One, and the papal residence at Castel Gandolfo, Vatican Two. In the 1980s, the Gemelli set up a special Papal suite, which is still in use today. It's a small apartment on the tenth floor, an all-white suite with austere, simple furnishings. As well as the bedroom and bathroom, there is a living room, with a sofa bed for his aides and a chapel with a kneeler and a large crucifix, where the Pope can attend or celebrate mass and say prayers. The long access corridor, leading to the suite is guarded by Italian State Police, the Vatican Gendarmerie and hospital security. The Papal suite is reserved for popes, but other patients are treated on the same floor. There's a balcony where the Pope can appear to greet the faithful and say the weekly Angelus prayer. Well-wishers often gather in the square outside the hospital to pray for the health of the pontiff. Flowers, cards, photos and candles are often laid at the foot of the statue of John Paul II. According to official announcements, Pope Benedict XVI was never admitted to the hospital during his 8-year papacy, although he visited when his brother received treatment there in 2014. Pope Francis has been treated at the Gemelli several times. In 2013, he had an operation on his colon. He was treated for infectious bronchitis in March 2023, and had surgery for an intestinal hernia later that year. He has often been seen thanking his medical team and other hospital workers. At the end of one stay, he baptised a newborn baby, and shared a pizza dinner with his doctors, nurses, assistants and Vatican security personnel."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgd0vdg34qo,'Trump hasn't got any plan': Russians speak to BBC after three years of war,2025-02-22T00:31:44.495Z,Steve Rosenberg,"Driving into Tver, the first thing I notice are the soldiers. They're everywhere. On billboards, the sides of buildings, at bus stops. Portraits with the words ""Hero of Russia"". Posters of troops with Kalashnikov rifles encouraging the public to ""Love, be proud of and defend"" Russia. In other words, to sign up and go and fight in Ukraine. Three years after its full-scale invasion of its neighbour, Russia is seeking new recruits. Despite all the military imagery around town, if you live in Tver it's possible to convince yourself that life is normal. The front line is hundreds of miles away. ""Just look around,"" Mikhail, a local teacher, tells me. ""Cars are passing by and all the shops are open. No shells are falling from anywhere. We are not panicking. We can't hear any sirens wailing. We do not run to any evacuation points."" For many Russians their invasion of Ukraine – what the Kremlin still calls a ""special military operation"" – is something they only encounter on their TV screens. But for people like Anna, it's much more real. ""I know a lot of people who went off to fight,"" Anna says when we get chatting on the street. ""Some of them never came home. I hope [the war] ends as soon as possible."" Donald Trump claims that's what he wants, too. Without inviting Ukraine to the negotiating table, the Trump administration has already entered direct talks with the Russian leadership. What do Russians make of the US president and his overtures to Moscow? ""Trump is a dark horse,"" believes Anna. ""I'm not sure what to expect from him."" Some of the people I talk to in Tver repeat the official narrative they have been hearing for the last three years on state TV: that their country is not the aggressor, that Russia is defending Russians and Russian-speakers in Ukraine and liberating, not occupying, territory. It doesn't mean that Russian society as a whole buys into this alternative reality. ""In a society people always prefer to be in the mainstream,"" believes Andrei Kolesnikov, a columnist for newtimes.ru and Novaya Gazeta. ""If the mainstream is pro-war and the TV says that we are at war with the West, the average citizen will think like this. It's easier not to think about the details. You want to live peacefully, so why not join the majority? ""Some researchers call this the foetal position. When you defend yourself from this unexplainable world you look like a baby. You say: 'I can't explain to myself what is happening. I believe you. You can feed me with words. I'll accept it.' This is typical for all societies of this kind: a bit authoritarian, a bit totalitarian."" Larissa and her husband Valery willingly accept the official line. ""We're all for the special military operation,"" Larissa tells me. ""We're ready to volunteer and go there ourselves!"" They haven't yet, clearly. ""We hope [Russia] will be victorious. We want Ukraine's total capitulation."" The police turn up. They've received a call informing them that ""suspicious-looking people with a camera"" are going around Tver. Meaning us. They're polite but want to know why we're here. They take a statement from our driver. They check our vehicle. They ask me for an official explanation for our visit. I tell them we're gauging the mood away from Moscow. We show our documents, which are in order. While we've been talking to the officers, a camera crew from Russian state TV has pitched up and started filming us. ""We were just passing,"" says the reporter, ""and we spotted the police and recognised you. Can you tell me what's going on?"" ""I don't know,"" I reply. ""Perhaps you can tell us?"" ""What have you been filming?"" ""We've been talking to people on the street,"" I say. ""I believe we're allowed to do that."" ""Yes, in our country we have freedom of speech,"" the reporter replies. ""Perhaps the police just want to help you? It's unpleasant to hear Western TV spreading fake news that there's no free speech in Russia. You're talking to people freely and no one gets in your way."" ""Apart from you,"" I point out. ""And the police officers standing next to our car."" The incident, which lasted about an hour, is no real surprise. Three years of war have fuelled suspicion of the West inside Russia. Early signs of a thaw in US-Russian relations have yet to change that. From talking to people in Tver it becomes clear that Russians are hoping that an end to the fighting will bring economic relief. ""Prices are so high now for the things I need most,"" says Yulia as she rocks her baby to sleep in a pram. ""Like the price of potatoes and onions. I really feel it."" But teacher Mikhail doesn't feel that Donald Trump has any strategy for securing peace. ""Unfortunately, Trump hasn't got any plan,"" believes Mikhail. ""He is an improviser. He doesn't know what he's going to do. My sympathies are with him. I'm glad he won. But speaking about this episode, we're all in the dark. And Trump is in the dark himself."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yxwy2wknpo,Man offers to split winnings after thieves hit jackpot with his credit card,2025-02-21T21:40:51.982Z,Eve Webster,"A Frenchman has appealed to two thieves who used his stolen credit card to purchase a jackpot-winning scratch card to come forward, promising to split the €500,000 (£413,664) prize with them. Introducing himself as Jean-David E, the man told RTL radio that since the money would otherwise be seized by the authorities, he is looking to strike a deal with them. ""Without me, they would not have won, but without them, I would not have bought this ticket. I want to offer them to share the winnings,"" the Toulouse resident said. No-one has so far come forward with the winning ticket, which has been blocked by France's national lottery operator Française des Jeux (FDJ), according to Jean-David. Jean-David discovered that his backpack containing his wallet had been stolen from his car parked in central Toulouse on the 3 February. After calling his bank to block his credit card, he discovered that €52.50 (£43.47) had been spent via a contactless payment at Tabac des Thermes, a nearby corner shop. Jean-David went to the shop to see if the staff had seen anything suspicious or if any of his belongings had been abandoned at the shop. ""My client spoke to the cashier and discovered that two men who appeared to be homeless used his credit card to purchase cigarettes and several scratch cards"", Jean-David's lawyer, Pierre Debuisson told the BBC. The two men told the cashier that they had won the €500,000 jackpot on one of the cards and that they were planning on going to FDJ to claim their winnings. The cashier found the two men's behaviour suspicious as they were unable to enter the PIN number of one of the cards they attempted to make the purchase with, according to Jean-David. After his conversation with the cashier, Jean-David contacted the local police who in turn reached out the FDJ to alert the games company. The police are now likely to seize the winnings and should the thieves approach the FDJ themselves, they are likely to be arrested, according to Jean-Davide. Scratch card winners have 30 days from the date of purchase to claim their winnings, and for Jean-Davide and his unlikely collaborators, the deadline is fast approaching. His lawyer Mr Debuisson proposed an amnesty: ""My client was very happy to have his credit card stolen in these circumstances and so is not looking to prosecute. This is also a miraculous opportunity for these two men to build a new life for themselves."" ""Unless they contact my lawyer, the ticket is unusable. So why not settle amicably and do fifty-fifty?,"" 40-year-old Jean-David told RTL. ""For that amount of money, I'm ready to come to an agreement"", he added, explaining that he would use his share of the winnings - €250,000 (£206,988) - to help pay off his mortgage. The FDJ and Toulouse police have been approached for comment."

Danielle McLaughlin, 28, from Buncrana in County Donegal, was found dead in a field in the western state of Goa in March 2017. Vikat Bhagat was found guilty of raping and murdering Ms McLaughlin and sentenced to life imprisonment earlier this month. ""I could never see her face…he left Danielle (in such a way) that Danielle could never be identified,"" Ms McLaughlin's mother Andrea Brannigan said. Warning: This page contains distressing details Ms Brannigan said she had gone to see her daughter after she had been brought home with the help of the Kevin Bell Repatriation Trust. ""It didn't work but they did try. And it's something I'll always be grateful for. But I could never view her… I could never see her face,"" Ms Brannigan said. ""You've always doubts then… I wonder was it her. Days you would have doubts – are you sure its definitely her."" Ms McLaughlin was identified by hair colour and by a distinctive tattoo, her mother said. She had been left unrecognisable by her killer who used a rock and bottle during a brutal assault, her mother added. A second post mortem examination found brain damage and strangulation as the cause of death. Danielle's family sat beside Bahgat during court proceedings. ""That was hard. I could see no remorse,"" she told BBC News NI. Ms Brannigan added: ""I've no feelings for him because he doesn't deserve my feelings. Only Danielle does."" She hopes he is never released, and that ""no family or friends ever go through the pain that we're going through because he robbed the world of beauty and of somebody who was going to do a lot of good in this world."" Danielle was the eldest of six daughters, her mum said, adding she doted on all her siblings, and they all looked up to her. Ms McLaughlin travelled to India in February 2017. She was there for two weeks before she was murdered. The Liverpool John Moores University student had been staying in a beach hut with an Australian friend. The pair had been celebrating Holi, a Hindu festival, in a nearby village. She left the village at night and her body was found the next day by a local farmer in an isolated spot. People always remembered the psychology and sociology student's ""big smile and infectious laugh,"" her mother said. Danielle had struggled in childhood with dyslexia, Ms Brannigan said, but had loved writing in her diaries and grew up to be ""a brilliant friend and an amazing sister"". ""The girls miss her terrible. I miss Danielle as I used to go to her with all my problems. I miss talking to her. We talked every day."" Danielle's mum said she was ""a free spirt"" who had loved travelling in Australia and India – where she had helped to build schools and also volunteered in an orphanage. ""She trusted everybody,"" Ms Brannigan said. ""That would be part of the reason why this happened because she did trust everybody."" He family now hold on to the ""many happy memories"" and want the world to know of Danielle's genrousity and kindness. ""She was always so kind. She was kind up until she passed away. She didn't see evil,"" Ms Brannigan said."" Rape victims cannot usually be named under Indian law. Their identities are often hidden in a bid to protect them from being shunned in society. In this case, Ms McLaughlin's family have spoken to the media to raise awareness of her case."

Ryan Ndede, 23, of Boroimhe Birches in Dublin, is charged with the murder of Quham Babatunde. Mr Babutunde died after he was stabbed close to Grafton Street in the early hours of Saturday morning. A detective constable said she was aware of the facts of the case and could connect the accused to the charge. Setting out the facts of the case a prosecution lawyer described the incident as a ""group melee"" in the early hours of Saturday morning. He told the court the accused was identified on CCTV approaching the deceased with a knife concealed under a puffer jacket. He said Mr Babutunde was stabbed four times, including once through the heart, which proved fatal. The prosecution lawyer said Garda used CCTV to track the defendant through the streets to a rented apartment in Dublin 8, where a knife was recovered. He said the knife was still undergoing forensic examination. The court heard Mr Ndede arrived by bus in Belfast on Sunday afternoon where he later boarded a ferry to Birkenhead. The prosecution lawyer said the ferry was turned around and the accused was arrested in Belfast.  A defence solicitor representing the accused said the court did not have jurisdiction in this case. He also told the court the description of the accused did not match alleged identification evidence against him. The detective said there were ""several different descriptions"" of the alleged perpetrator. District Judge Alan White said that he did hold jurisdiction in the case. No bail application was made and Mr Ndede was remanded into custody. He is due to appear at Belfast Magistrates' Court via video link on 21 March. An application for legal aid was granted."

A series of undersea cables and gas pipelines have been damaged in suspected attacks since Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, prompting Nato to launch a monitoring mission in the sea last month. The Swedish coastguard has dispatched a research vessel to the east of Gotland, which is the country's largest island and the reported location of the latest breach. Sweden's Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson has said the government is aware of the cable break and added it ""must be seen in the context of the current serious security situation"". The owner of the cable, Finnish telecom operators Cinia, said it detected minor damage to its fibre-optic cable but added it was still functioning as usual. Cinia also said it is the third time this cable has been damaged in recent months. The cable was severed in November last year. There has been an increase in damage to undersea infrastructure in the Baltic Sea over the past few months, largely caused by civilian ships dragging their anchors across cables. Swedish police have said ""the preliminary investigation relates to suspected sabotage"". The Swedish coastguard has said they do not know when the damage occurred. ""We have a ship called KBV 003 on its way to east of Gotland. It is in the Swedish economic zone and we are assisting with the crime scene investigation,"" the coastguard added. European leaders have suspected Russian involvement in breaches. However, poor weather, inadequate equipment and human error has been found to be responsible for some damages. Bulgarian ship the Vezhen was cleared of sabotage by the Swedish authorities earlier this month."

On Thursday, Rubiales was found guilty of sexual assault and ordered by Spain's High Court to pay a fine of €10,800 (£8,942). Rubiales was acquitted of coercion, after allegedly trying to pressure Hermoso into publicly saying that the kiss was consensual. Hermoso's lawyer, Angel Chavarria, said the player intended to appeal, but did not provide further details on what specifically she might appeal against. The BBC has contacted Hermoso's lawyer. The High Court ruling also banned Rubiales from going within a 200m radius of Hermoso and from communicating with her for one year, the court said in a statement. Prosecutors had demanded a prison sentence for Rubiales, who has also said he will appeal against the verdict. During the 2023 World Cup, as Spain's players received their medals after defeating England in Sydney to win, Rubiales grabbed Hermoso by the head and kissed her on the lips. He later described the kiss as an ""act of affection"" and told the court that he was ""absolutely sure"" Hermoso had given her consent. In her testimony earlier this month, Hermoso insisted that she had not given consent and that the incident had ""stained one of the happiest days of my life"". The incident sparked nationwide protests and calls for the resignation of Rubiales. Three of Rubiales's former colleagues who were also on trial, accused of colluding in the alleged coercion - Jorge Vilda, coach of the World Cup-winning side, Rubén Rivera, the Real Federación Española de Fútbol (RFEF)'s former head of marketing, and Albert Luque, former sporting director - were cleared of those charges."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn48y8xg53lo,Katya Adler: Far right looks for breakthrough in Germany's election,2025-02-21T00:48:10.292Z,Katya Adler,"A political tidal wave is crashing across Germany. That's what the hard-right nationalist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party firmly believes. It is labelled ""radical"", ""racist"" and ""anti-democratic"" by opponents. Germany's domestic intelligence service says the party is ""anti-constitutional"". But if polls are right, the AfD will become Germany's second largest political force after elections this Sunday. That would be a huge shift in tectonic plates, not just at home but across Europe. Why is the AfD such a big deal, you might ask? Parties on the populist right have grown in support across much of Europe. The AfD points to Donald Trump as well. They share his ""anti-woke"", tough-on-migration, pro-fossil-fuel message. They too are keen to stop sending weapons to Ukraine, and to de-escalate tensions with Russia. The Trump administration supports them right back - publicly, to the outrage of many Germans. The thing is, Germany isn't just any other country. It is Europe's largest economy, one of its most influential nations. It still carries the weight of its Nazi past. Alongside the UK and France, it's one of the Big Three that helped shape and secure Europe's liberal order and defence structures following both World War Two and the Cold War. Never before in post-war Germany has a hard-right party been so successful, while on the cusp of being identified as a threat to the Federal Republic and its liberal constitution. France's influential opposition leader, Marine Le Pen, whose party is also considered far-right, has distanced herself from the AfD on the European stage, apparently judging its positions and ethno-nationalist reputation too radical. The long-held assumption among the mainstream at home and abroad had been that Germany's dark past immunised it against any serious flirtations with the extreme right. But there's a lot about this election that's making observers shift their view of Germany. And I will come back to the AfD, which vigorously denies its ""extremist"" label. Germans have suffered a kick in the gut - in terms of self-image and their country's international reputation. For years, they got used to being admired - and envied - as the economic powerhouse of Europe. Vorsprung durch technik, roughly translating as ""progress through technology"", was an advertising slogan for Audi cars in the 1980s. For decades it encapsulated Germany's reputation in the international imagination. The country was seen as modern, dynamic and technologically advanced. And the automobile industry was one of the main arteries pumping wealth into Germany's economic heart. But fundamental flaws have now been exposed in the German economic model. It is widely viewed as kaputt (broken) - relying too heavily on energy-intensive, old-fashioned industries like combustion-engine cars and the chemical industry. Critics question Germany's lack of foresight, or ability to move with the times. Where was the serious investment in R&D? In big tech? In AI? To make matters worse, during Angela Merkel's 16 years as chancellor - she stepped down in 2021 - Germany became increasingly dependent on: All of this left Germany very exposed. Donald Trump now says Europe can no longer rely on US security support and guarantees. China has made rapid advances in the automobile industry and dominates electric car technology. So far less need for German imports. And Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine left Germany scrambling for alternative energy sources. Buying liquid natural gas, from the US and others, is expensive, leading to financial strain on many energy-intensive German businesses. The result: Germany's economy is sluggish and sticky. As the biggest member of the eurozone currency, that has an impact way beyond its borders. European allies are frustrated. Germany's military is also a source of irritation (that's putting it politely) among European neighbours. Berlin is a key power in the defence alliance, Nato. Donald Trump's return to the White House means Europeans need to provide more of their own capabilities. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz pledged a zeitenwende - a turning point - for his country's depleted military, after Russia's full scale invasion of Ukraine. Yet Germany's military remains in a debilitated state - less battle-ready, we are told, than three years ago. Partly due to its donations to Ukraine. Germany, after the US, has been the biggest donor of military aid to Ukraine and most political parties in Germany are in favour of continuing to support Kyiv. The AfD takes a very different stance. ""Peace"" is one of the most frequent signs you see at their rallies. They want a rapprochement with Russia, to immediately stop sending weapons to Ukraine, and to use resources instead to build up Germany's armed forces for protection at home. More than 4,000 bridges in Germany are broken or in a dubious state. I could hardly believe my ears when I first heard that. But it is the reported figure in a country whose infrastructure has been quietly crumbling for years due to chronic under-investment - both public and private. Train punctuality in Germany is appalling - worse than in the UK, which will astound weary British commuters. Digitisation is lamentable too. Mobile phone reception is patchy outside cities and people are still known to use faxes! But even if recent German governments had wanted to invest more, they faced legal limits on spending. A debt brake was written into the German constitution following the financial crisis of 2008/9, with a constraint on new debt of no more than 0.35% of GDP, except in times of national emergency. Germans didn't trust their politicians any more. They had seen government spending spiral at home and abroad. The euro currency, which Germany depends on, almost collapsed. But what seemed to voters an anchor of financial stability then, now appears to many, a block to economic growth. Rows about reforming the debt brake were the final straw leading to the collapse of Germany's outgoing coalition, and the snap election this Sunday. But, new German government beware: breaking the debt brake will be no mean feat. You need a two-thirds majority in parliament to change the German constitution. Migration is a huge issue in Germany. And a big vote winner for the AfD. It is far from the only country worrying about migration levels in Europe, but Germany alone took in over a million asylum seekers, mainly from Syria and Afghanistan, during Europe's migrant crisis in 2015/16. The country has also opened its doors to 1.2 million Ukrainian refugees. Many Germans were proud of what they called their ""welcome culture"". But a spate of attacks by asylum seekers from the Middle East and Afghanistan has re-ignited a debate about how open Germany's borders should be. There have been stabbings, a machete assault, a car ramming into civilians at a Christmas market and again at a recent trade union demonstration in Munich, where yet another small child was killed. The AfD insists it is not racist or anti-migration, and that anyone is welcome in Germany if they arrive by legal means, get a job, contribute to society and respect local norms and culture. The party says it would immediately deport all immigrants who commit a crime, and anyone who arrives here illegally. That stance was applauded by numerous AfD supporters I spoke to at rallies in the lead-up to Sunday's election - including young women who told me they no longer felt safe on the streets. It's also worth noting that in May, a German court found that ""at least a significant part of the AfD"" believed that anyone with a migrant heritage was not ""properly German"" - even if they held German citizenship. It concluded that the AfD aimed to ""grant German citizens with a migration background only a legally devalued status"". This goes against the German constitution. Worried they could lose voters to the AfD over the question of migration and borders, Germany's centre left and centre right have moved to the right in their rhetoric. This is a victory for the AfD, whatever the outcome of the election. Even if it becomes the second largest force in parliament, as predicted, it is very, very unlikely to make it into Germany's next government. The post-World War Two political system in Germany is designed so that no single party can dominate parliament as the Nazis did after they were first voted in, in 1933. Coalition-building is the name of the game. And there has been a so-called firewall in place since the end of World War Two - a cross-party consensus to keep the extreme right out of government. The AfD insists it is conservative and libertarian, not a radical, right-wing force. It points to its growing support base, in west as well as east Germany and among younger voters too. It accuses opponents of trying to shut it up, shut it down and keep it out of power. That, it says, is anti-democratic. Elon Musk grabbed headlines Europe-wide when he proclaimed in December that only the AfD can save Germany. The majority here still insists their country needs to be saved from AfD."

""You can kill a man... and you can walk free. Not even a single night in prison. Just a slap on the wrist and a ticket to carry on your life, like nothing ever happened,"" Keating posted on Instagram. Dean Harte, 22, from Tyrellspass, County Westmeath, collided with Ciarán Keating's car while driving near Swinford, County Mayo, in July 2023. He was given a 17-month suspended sentence at Castlebar Circuit Court in Mayo on Wednesday after he pleaded guilty to careless driving causing death. In a statement, Ronan Keating described the the sentencing as ""devastating"" and said the Keating family will be ""encouraging the DPP to appeal and rightfully fight for justice"". On the day of the crash, Ciarán Keating and his wife Annemarie, who was also seriously injured in the crash, had been travelling to watch their son play football. The court heard how Harte failed to take a bend on a stretch of the N5 between Swinford and Bohola. Harte's Audi A3 crashed headlong into Mr Keating's Ford Focus and the 57-year-old died at the scene. The court was told nobody was speeding during the incident. Writing on social media, the singer described the the sentencing as ""devastating"" and said the Keating family will be ""encouraging the DPP to appeal"". ""We wonder why we keep seeing this kind of behaviour on our roads, why people keep dying in road accidents across Ireland every week? ""It's a joke and it's morally corrupt that rather than trying to fix our broken system, they all turn a blind eye. ""Shame on Dean Harte but more so, shame on everyone involved in this process that contributed to the heart-breaking outcome for my family. ""The Lord himself knows the injustice that was served and the Keating family will never find peace. ""We will continue to fight for Ciarán's justice. At this time we think of all the other families who have found themselves in our position, and we pray that other families never do."" The Keating Family added: ""The only way to stop reckless driving and encourage people (especially youth) to abide by the law, is to enforce consequences for not doing so."""

The retailer's Irish arm, New Look Retailers (Ireland) Ltd, entered into liquidation on Thursday. The winding down of operations in the country follows several years of sustained losses and challenging market conditions. New Look staff were notified immediately following the appointment of provisional liquidators at the High Court, and further staff engagement is planned over the coming days. In a statement the company said it has had to ""navigate a tough external environment which has only become more unpredictable"". ""We have adapted to this evolving landscape by investing in our product proposition and digital offer. However, due to the increasingly volatile trading conditions we needed to expedite our existing plans, which included conducting a review of our operations in the Republic of Ireland,"" the company said. That review, the company added, concluded ""it was no longer viable to continue trading"" in the Republic of Ireland. The move will not impact its parent company in the UK, which will continue to trade through its 344 stores and its website. A 30-day staff consultation process will now commence for New Look employees in the Republic of Ireland over the coming days. New Look employs about 347 staff across its 26-store network in the Republic of Ireland. The company has stores in areas across Dublin, Cork, Galway, Wicklow and Letterkenny in County Donegal. A majority of its stores are of small to medium size, employing an average of 12-13 staff per store. It said all its Irish stores will close in the coming days before reopening later this month for a clearance sale."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39vljzn0mlo,Spain's ex-football boss Luis Rubiales fined for World Cup kiss,2025-02-20T15:18:08.125Z,Ruth Comerford,"Spain's former football federation boss Luis Rubiales has been found guilty of sexual assault for kissing player Jenni Hermoso without her consent and ordered to pay a fine of €10,800 (£8,942), Spain's High Court has ruled. He was acquitted of coercion, for allegedly trying to pressure Hermoso into saying publicly that the kiss was consensual. As Spain's players received their medals after defeating England in Sydney to win the 2023 World Cup, Rubiales grabbed Hermoso by the head and kissed her on the lips. The incident triggered protests and calls for the resignation of Rubiales, who has said he will appeal against the verdict. The ruling also banned Rubiales from going within a 200m radius of Hermoso and from communicating with her for one year, the court said in a statement. Three of Rubiales's former colleagues who were also on trial, accused of colluding in the alleged coercion - Jorge Vilda, coach of the World Cup-winning side, Rubén Rivera, the Real Federación Española de Fútbol (RFEF)'s former head of marketing, and Albert Luque, former sporting director - were cleared of those charges. Prosecutors had demanded a prison sentence for Rubiales, who last week told a court he was ""absolutely sure"" Hermoso had given her consent before he kissed her. He described the kiss as an ""act of affection"", adding that in the moment it was ""something completely spontaneous"". In her testimony earlier this month, Hermoso insisted that she had not given Rubiales permission and that the incident had ""stained one of the happiest days of my life"". She told the court in Madrid: ""My boss was kissing me, and this shouldn't happen in any social or work setting."" ""A kiss on the lips is only given when I decide so,"" she said at the time. Rubiales was accused of sexual assault and of trying to coerce Hermoso into saying the kiss had been consensual. The incident was witnessed by millions of television viewers and an entire stadium after the Spanish women's team won the 2023 World Cup. The ensuing uproar gave momentum to a ""Me Too""-style movement in the Spanish women's game, in which players sought to combat sexism and achieve parity with their male peers. Rubiales resigned in September 2023 following weeks of resisting pressure to stand down, and after Fifa suspended him and Spanish prosecutors opened an investigation."

The blast happened at a service station in the village on 7 October 2022. A number of objections, including some from victims' families, had previously been lodged against Vivo Shell Ltd's application for the development. In a statement, Phoenix Law's Darragh Mackin, who represents some of the victims' families, described the decision to grant planning permission as ""morally bankrupt"" and indicated that they intend to challenge ""every aspect"" of it. He said it would be ""unfathomable"" for the Grenfell tower or the Stardust nightclub to be rebuilt, and Creeslough was ""no different"". There is now an appeal period, which will last for four weeks, whereby any potential objections can be raised with An Bord Pleanála, a body that decides on appeals from planning decisions made by local authorities in the Republic of Ireland. The application was approved by Donegal County Council. It is for the demolition of the existing building and the erection of a new commercial building, including a shop, a post office, an off-licence, a store, a deli, toilets and a forecourt. Other associated site development works listed in the application include a space for a memorial garden. Ann-Marie Boyle, whose sister Catherine O'Donnell and nephew James Monaghan died in the explosion, told BBC News NI families were ""very angry at how the whole thing has been handled"". ""From the very start we were told by Donegal County Council that any decisions that were being made or anything that had to be discussed, the families would be at the forefront,"" she said. ""No consultations with families, everybody has just ploughed on, doing their own thing."" Ms Boyle said Donna Harper, who lost her daughter Leona Harper in Creeslough, contacted Ms Boyle to inform her that the planning permission decision was in a local newspaper. ""They knew before the families knew,"" she said. ""The decision was published on the portal and families only received their registered letters this morning after the fact it has all been out in the public,"" Ms Boyle said. ""It just brings all the trauma back. ""We just don't want it to be on that site, it's so disrespectful to all the 10 people that died,"" Ms Boyle added. She intends to appeal the decision. Marie Ronaghan, who lost her sister Martina Martin in the explosion, said the family was ""devastated"". ""It brings everything back,"" she told BBC News NI. ""We can't believe that they have got planning permission,"" Ms Ronaghan said. She sad the family had been following the process on the council website. ""Very late last night I got a message with a photograph of the front page of our local newspaper to say the decision had been granted,"" she said. Ms Ronaghan said it was ""horrible to find out like that"". ""We can't believe that they are going to build a shop back where 10 people have lost their lives. It is so disrespectful to the feelings of the families,"" she added. She said she felt like ""we haven't been taken into consideration"". ""The town needs a shop but not where families lost their loved ones."" Áine Flanagan, partner of Robert Garwe and mum of Shauna Flanagan Garwe who lost their lives in the explosion, says the decision ""is absolutely appalling"". ""The ten victims of this explosion, it is complete and utter disrespect for us on every ground,"" Ms Flanagan said. ""There are no words for how the families feel, we feel betrayed. ""There is nobody standing up for us on any level, we need to get the country behind us."" Speaking to BBC News NI, Ms Flanagan said she can only describe it as ""gut wrenching"" and that there is ""no logic"" behind the decision. ""There's no respect for us. To put in ten poles on a site with a kerb that is a memorial garden... I cant even express how horrible that is,"" she said. ""It's like my heart has been ripped out and all my family has been deeply affected by the loss of Shauna and Bob. ""My right to grieve has not been taken into account,"" Ms Flanagan added. In the planning proposal, Vivo Shell Ltd said: ""It is important that it is acknowledged that this is a very sensitive application insofar as the site is where the awful event of 7 of October 2022 took place, an event which had a massive impact on the local area and much wider afield and has left families to reconcile the tragic loss of loved ones"". They said they hope family members of persons who were injured or deceased ""will see that much consideration and thought has gone into the application so as to be respectful towards all"". ""It is unfathomable that the Grenfell tower or the Stardust nightclub would be rebuilt. Creeslough is no different,"" solicitor Darragh Mackin said. ""Despite the fierce and unrelenting pleas from the families directly affected, the Donegal County Council has placed commercial and business interests above the interests and rights of these families."" ""Such a decision will not be taken lying down. Our clients have today signalled their intention to challenge every aspect of this planning decision in an effort to vindicate their rights, and the rights of their loved ones."" In a statement, Donegal County Council said a notification of the decision to grant has been posted to all third parties who made a submission and the applicant. ""The applicant/agent and any third party have four weeks to consider the decision and determine whether or not they wish to take the matter to appeal via An Bord Pleanála,"" they stated. Creeslough is a small village in the north west of the island of Ireland, about 15 miles (24km) from Letterkenny and 30 miles (48km) from the border with Northern Ireland. It has a population of about 400 people. The blast, on 7 October 2022, resulted in the highest number of civilian casualties in a single incident in the county in decades. The victims - four men, three women, two teenagers and a five-year-old girl - were from the village or surrounding areas. Those who died were Robert Garwe and his five-year-old daughter Shauna Flanagan-Garwe; Catherine O'Donnell and her 13-year-old son James Monaghan; Jessica Gallagher; Martin McGill; James O'Flaherty; Martina Martin; Hugh Kelly; and 14-year-old Leona Harper."

It is the first time in more than half a century that there has been no sun in the Irish capital for this length of time. ""I looked at the blue sky this morning and felt such a lift,"" Isabel Ryan told BBC News NI as she enjoyed a walk in the sun with friends along Sandymount beach. Met Éireann, the Irish meteorological service, has confirmed that its observation station at Dublin Airport recorded zero sunshine between 8 and 18 February. It means that this month's dull spell has now equalled a record dating back to March 1969, almost 56 years ago, when Dublin Airport recorded 11 consecutive days without sunshine. When the sun eventually reappeared in in the skies above the Irish capital city on Wednesday, many locals headed for the coastline. Isabel said: ""It's just stunning."" ""I was delighted that we were all meeting for a walk. Yesterday I'd have thought 'maybe not' but today is amazing."" Her friend, Linda Kelly, said people were getting fed up with this month's dull period. ""Not a glimmer of blue sky,"" she said. But today, she was feeling relief as the sun appeared during the early part of the day. ""It's shining on the water here in Sandymount and it's just glorious. The lighthouse in the distance, it's just beautiful."" Another friend, Deirdre Clerkin, added: ""We are out today and the sun is amazing and I'm so happy because it just puts a smile on your face."" Met Éireann explained that Ireland normally gets between 1,100 and 1,600 hours of sunshine each year. The Irish meteorological service told BBC News NI that the sunniest months are May and June when sunshine duration averages between five and 6.5 hours per day over most of the country. The extreme southeast gets most sunshine, averaging over seven hours a day in early summer. December is the dullest month, with an average daily sunshine ranging from about one hour in the north to almost two hours in the extreme southeast. Over the year, most areas get an average of between 3.25 and 3.75 hours of sunshine each day. The country's longest recorded stretch of consecutive days without sunshine since 1941 is 16 days. This has occurred twice, once at Belmullet, County Mayo, between 1 and 16 September 1956 and, more recently, at Cork Airport between 23 December 2018 and 7 January 2019."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyrnjrjrr5o,Starmer backs Zelensky after Trump calls him 'dictator',2025-02-20T09:43:55.640Z,Joshua Nevett Eleanor Montague,"Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer has backed Volodymyr Zelensky as a ""democratically elected leader"" after Donald Trump described the Ukrainian president as a ""dictator"". Sir Keir called Zelensky on Wednesday evening and told him it was ""perfectly reasonable"" for Ukraine to ""suspend elections during wartime as the UK did during World War Two"", Downing Street said. The US president had earlier criticised Zelensky, saying he had done a ""terrible job"" and claiming ""he refuses to have elections"" in Ukraine. Zelensky's five-year term was due to end in May 2024, but elections have been suspended since martial law was declared after Russia's invasion. Sir Keir will travel to Washington DC next week for his first in-person meeting with Trump. The PM has said he wants to use his meeting next week to discuss a ""US backstop"" that he says is necessary to deter Russia from attacking Ukraine again. But the deepening rift between the US and Ukraine has now increased the political jeopardy for him. Sir Keir has said he would be prepared to deploy British troops to Ukraine to help guarantee its security as part of a peace deal provided there was a US ""backstop"". Western officials said the number of land troops involved would be less than 30,000, with the aim of providing reassurance to the Ukrainian people, rather than a peacekeeping force. In his phone call with Zelensky, Sir Keir ""stressed the need for everyone to work together"", a Downing Street spokesperson said. ""The prime minister reiterated his support for the US-led efforts to get a lasting peace in Ukraine that deterred Russia from any future aggression,"" they added. Zelensky said they had discussed ""upcoming plans and opportunities"", adding: ""UK's support matters indeed, and we will never forget the respect the British people have shown for Ukraine and our citizens."" There has been widespread criticism of Trump's comments around the world - including from Sweden's prime minister as well as German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who said it was ""simply wrong and dangerous"". Trump's former vice-president, Mike Pence, also criticised the comments, posting on X: ""Mr President, Ukraine did not 'start' this war. Russia launched an unprovoked and brutal invasion claiming hundreds of thousands of lives."" Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch also defended the Ukrainian leader, writing on X that Zelensky was ""the democratically elected leader of Ukraine who bravely stood up to Putin's illegal invasion"". But Badenoch said Trump was ""right that Europe needs to pull its weight"" and called on Sir Keir to ""get on a plane to Washington and show some leadership"". Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said calling Zelensky a dictator ""must be where the line is drawn"" and he hoped ""the whole political spectrum... will speak with one voice in opposition to Trump's lies"". Former Conservative PM Boris Johnson posted on X to say ""of course Ukraine didn't start the war"". ""Trump's statements are not intended to be historically accurate but to shock Europeans into action,"" he added. According to Western officials, there are now preliminary discussions about providing a reassurance force to Ukraine. This force could use drones and intelligence gathering planes to monitor Ukrainian cities, critical infrastructure and ports rather than have troops in the east of the country. This would be part of plans to restore a safe international airspace over Ukraine and make the waters of the Black Sea secure. Western officials said there might be larger land forces based in countries bordering Ukraine. They also said that any US backstop is more likely to be in the form of airpower rather than troops on the ground and that these aircraft may be based in countries neighbouring Ukraine such as Poland and Romania. Russia's ambassador to the UK, Andrei Kelin, again rejected the idea of foreign peacekeeping troops being allowed in Ukraine in the event of any peace deal. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, the Russian ambassador to the UK said Moscow would not accept troops from the UK or other European nations in Ukraine, even if Trump approved the idea. Mr Kelin also questioned whether there could be a potential peace agreement without fresh elections in Ukraine. Trump's attacks came after Zelensky accused the US president of living in a ""bubble"" of Russian disinformation. The US and Russia's relations have grown closer in recent days, after officials met in Saudi Arabia and agreed to negotiate an end to the war.

His attacks came after Zelensky, reacting to US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia from which Kyiv was excluded, said the US president was ""living in a disinformation space"" governed by Moscow. Speaking at a Saudi-backed investment meeting in Florida, Trump said the only thing Zelensky ""was really good at was playing Joe Biden like a fiddle"". The ""dictator"" slur quickly prompted criticism from European leaders including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who said ""it is simply wrong and dangerous to deny President Zelensky his democratic legitimacy"". UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer made it clear he backed Zelensky in a phone call to the Ukrainian president. A Downing Street spokesperson said Sir Keir ""expressed his support for President Zelensky as Ukraine's democratically elected leader"". It was ""perfectly reasonable to suspend elections during war time as the UK did during World War Two,"" the spokesperson added. Zelensky is due to meet the American envoy for Russia and Ukraine, Keith Kellogg, on Thursday. He said it was crucial that the discussion - and overall co-operation with the US - remains constructive. In a social media post, Zelensky said that peace could be more secure with the US and Europe. Zelensky's five-year term of office was due to come to an end in May 2024. However, Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and elections are suspended. Swedish Prime Minister Ulf Kristersson also criticised Trump's use of the word ""dictator"" while German Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock called the comments ""absurd"". ""If you look at the real world instead of just firing off a tweet, then you know who in Europe has to live in the conditions of a dictatorship: people in Russia, people in Belarus,"" she told broadcaster ZDF. Speaking in Florida, Trump called Zelensky a ""dictator"", just hours after using the same word in a Truth Social post about the Ukrainian president. ""He refuses to have elections. He's low in the real Ukrainian polls. How can you be high with every city being demolished?"" Trump said. He also referenced his attempt to get rare-earth minerals from Ukraine, accusing Zelensky's government of ""breaking the deal"". His address echoed his wording of the Truth Social post where Trump said Zelensky ""has done a terrible job, his country is shattered, and MILLIONS have unnecessarily died."" In the meantime, the US was ""successfully negotiating an end to the war with Russia,"" he said. A White House official said Trump's post was in direct response to Zelensky's ""disinformation"" comments. On Tuesday US and Russian officials held their first high-level, face-to-face talks since Russia's full-scale invasion. The former prime minister of Ukraine, Arseniy Yatsenyuk, told the BBC that Russia was ""popping champagne right now"" in response to Trump's comments. ""Volodymyr Zelensky is a completely legitimate president,"" he said. ""We cannot hold elections under martial law."" The war of words began with comments made by Trump on Tuesday at a news conference at Mar-a-Lago in Florida, when he blamed Ukraine for the war. Trump was asked by BBC News what his message was to Ukrainians who might feel betrayed, to which he replied: ""I hear that they're upset about not having a seat, well, they've had a seat for three years and a long time before that. This could have been settled very easily."" ""You should have never started it. You could have made a deal,"" Trump added. Trump did not mention that President Vladimir Putin took the decision to invade Ukraine in February 2022. Then on Wednesday, Zelensky told reporters in Kyiv: ""We are seeing a lot of disinformation and it's coming from Russia. With all due respect to President Donald Trump as a leader... he is living in this disinformation space."" He added that he believed ""the United States helped Putin to break out of years of isolation"". Later in the day, the Ukrainian leader said the world faced the choice to be ""with Putin or with peace"" and announced he would be meeting Washington's Ukraine envoy, Keith Kellogg, on Thursday. Earlier, Zelensky also rejected Trump's attempts to access Ukraine's rare minerals, saying no security guarantees were offered in exchange. Trump has attempted to make an issue out of Zelensky's popularity, claiming the Ukrainian president had only a 4% approval rating. But BBC Verify reports that polling conducted this month found 57% of Ukrainians said they trusted the president. In Wednesday's explosive Truth Social post, Trump also took aim at Europe, saying the war in Ukraine is ""far more important to Europe than it is to us"". ""We have a big, beautiful ocean as a separation,"" he said. Europe had ""failed to bring peace"" in the region, he added. Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin also spoke to reporters, saying he would meet Trump ""with pleasure"". For its part, the EU said it would place further sanctions on Russia. The new sanctions target Russian aluminium and dozens of vessels suspected of illegally transporting oil. They would also disconnect more Russian banks from the global Swift payment system and ban more Russian media outlets from broadcasting in Europe."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgwddmjyvzo,Trump says Russia 'has the cards' in Ukraine peace negotiations,2025-02-20T05:09:14.040Z,Bernd Debusmann Jr George Wright,"Donald Trump says he believes Russia has ""the cards"" in any peace talks to end the war in Ukraine because Russia has ""taken a lot of territory"". The US president told the BBC he trusted that Moscow wants to see an end to the war, which Russia started when it waged a full-scale invasion almost three years ago. Trump was flying back to Washington DC after speaking at a Saudi-backed investment meeting in Florida, where he called Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky a ""dictator"" for the second time in a day. Trump has been angered after Zelensky, reacting to US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia from which Kyiv was excluded, said the US president was ""living in a disinformation space"" governed by Moscow. ""I think the Russians want to see the war end, I really do. I think they have the cards a little bit, because they've taken a lot of territory. They have the cards,"" Trump told the BBC on Air Force One. When asked if he trusts that Russia wants peace, Trump said ""I do"". He was speaking after lashing out at Zelensky in Florida, where Trump called the Ukrainian president a ""dictator"", just hours after using the same word in a Truth Social post. A White House official said Trump's post was in direct response to Zelensky's ""disinformation"" comments. ""He refuses to have elections. He's low in the real Ukrainian polls. How can you be high with every city being demolished?"" Trump said in Florida. Zelensky's five-year term of office was due to come to an end in May 2024. However, Ukraine has been under martial law since Russia launched its full-scale invasion in February 2022 and elections are suspended. Trump has attempted to make an issue out of Zelensky's popularity, claiming the Ukrainian president had only a 4% approval rating. But BBC Verify reports that polling conducted this month found 57% of Ukrainians said they trusted the president. The ""dictator"" slur quickly prompted criticism from European leaders including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who said ""it is simply wrong and dangerous to deny President Zelensky his democratic legitimacy"". UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer made it clear he backed Zelensky in a phone call to the Ukrainian president. On Tuesday US and Russian officials held their first high-level, face-to-face talks since Russia's full-scale invasion. Ukraine was not invited. Trump then appeared to blame Ukraine for the war, stating ""you should have never started it. You could have made a deal"". In response, Zelensky accused Russia of lying during Tuesday's ""notorious meeting"". ""With all due respect to President Donald Trump as a leader... he is living in this disinformation space,"" he said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj91xgylkwlo,Georgia's richest man said to be moving funds to avoid US sanctions,2025-02-20T00:08:09.987Z,Rayhan Demytrie,"Last spring, when tens of thousands of Georgians were protesting against what they saw as a clear sign of Russian influence on the country's politics, Georgia's parliament rushed through amendments to the nation's tax code. Transparency International (TI) Georgia, the anti-corruption watchdog, wrote at the time that the change – which allows tax-free transfer of assets from offshore accounts to Georgia – may have been introduced to serve the interests of the country's richest person and former prime minister, Bidzina Ivanishvili. He is the founder and honorary chairman of the country's ruling party, Georgian Dream. ""Now it is clear, those changes were made for him,"" says senior economics analyst at TI Georgia, Beso Namchavadze. With an estimated wealth of $4.9bn (£3.9bn), Mr Ivanishvili made his money in 1990s Russia, in computing, metals and banking. Most of his wealth is believed to be tucked away in offshore companies. Georgia was plunged into political crisis and daily street protests last May when the country's MPs passed the contentious ""transparency on foreign influence bill"", often dubbed the ""foreign agents law"". Under this legislation, media and non-governmental organisations that receive more than 20% of their funding from abroad have to register as ""organisations acting in the interest of a foreign power"", submit themselves to stringent audits, or face punitive fines. It was widely seen as a move to prevent US and other Western influence on the country. Protests then continued when the Georgian Dream-led government won disputed parliamentary elections in October. Protests were spurred again at the start of December when it said it would be putting EU accession talks on hold. Hundreds of peaceful protesters were arrested and severely beaten up by the police. In response to this crackdown, the US government announced sanctions against Mr Ivanishvili at the end of last year. There is also the possibility of sanctions from the UK. Last month James MacCleary, a Liberal Democrat MP, introduced an Early Day Motion in the UK parliament calling on the government to impose sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili. The motion expressed ""deep concern at the suspension of Georgia's EU accession process and the increasing use of excessive force against peaceful protesters"". TI Georgia estimates that if the UK imposed sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili his entire business empire would be affected, because he has holding companies registered in two British Overseas Territories - British Virgin Islands and Cayman Islands. ""All his big business, which he has in Georgia, in the hospitality sector, in the energy sector, all the parent companies of these Georgian companies, the last beneficiaries are registered in these so-called offshore territories,"" says Beso Namchavadze. He adds that TI Georgia believes that Mr Ivanishvili and other family members are continuing to transfer ownership of companies they previously controlled through offshore entities to newly established firms in Georgia. In January of this year, paintings and other artwork worth nearly $500m were imported into Georgia, according to data published by the Ministry of Finance. Many believe the artwork was from Mr Ivanishvili's valuable collection. ""For everybody who knows him it's pretty clear that this is something that he values the most out of all the assets, and all the wealth, that he has,"" says Tina Khidasheli, Georgia's ex-defence minister and the head of the non-governmental organisation Civic Idea. ""He is going to bring paintings back and he does not want to pay tax on it."" The head of Georgia's parliamentary committee on finance and budget, Paata Kvijinadze, recently defended the tax-free transfer of assets from offshore accounts to Georgia. ""If anyone benefited from this law, I am happy about it,"" he said in a post on social media. ""This is exactly what the law was meant to be: to bring companies from offshore zones and attract more investments into the country"". In response to the proposed UK sanctions, Georgia's ruling party issued a statement defending Mr Ivanishvili, saying that a threat of sanctions was ""without any foundation"" against the party founder who brought ""democratic breakthrough to the country"". Separately, Mr Ivanishvili's lawyer announced last month that his client is suing Swiss bank Julius Baer for, among other reasons, misinterpreting ""the so-called"" American sanctions, which the lawyer described as ""political blackmail"". The US sanctions on Mr Ivanishvili call for his assets to be frozen, and place restrictions on US citizens and companies from doing business personally with him, but they do not affect his companies or family members. For more than a decade Mr Ivanishvili has been involved in legal battles with another Swiss bank, Credit Suisse, over fraud and mismanagement of his money. Some believe that the billionaire's mistrust of the West and increased use of conspiracy theories at home, such as accusing adversaries of being part of the ""global war party"", or ""deep state"", originate in his long-standing financial grievances. Ever since he became convinced that Credit Suisse was part of a grand conspiracy against him, says Tina Khdasheli. ""Bidzina Ivanishvili held Georgia hostage to his personal financial issues."" Experts say that even though Mr Ivanishvili's current official position is the honorary chairman of the ruling party, there is a clear understanding that he remains the number one person in Georgian politics. Sanctions against him are therefore seen as sanctions against the entire government. Nika Gilauri was prime minister of Georgia from 2009 to 2012. He now leads a private company called Reformatics, which advises governments around the world on economic reform. Mr Gilauri says that Georgia's continuing political instability and international isolation is negatively impacting the economy. ""We are seeing a very negative effect on FDI, foreign direct investment, if you take nine months of 2024 compared to nine months of 2023, we have a 40% drop. So going forward this is going to continue to get worse."" But the Georgian government paints a different picture. Last month Georgia's Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze signed a $6bn inward investment agreement with UAE property group Emaar. Levan Davitashvili, the Minister of Economy described it as the ""largest foreign investment deal"" in decades, which was expected to contribute 1.5% growth to the economy. Prime Minister Irakli Kobakhidze has even suggested that 10% growth was now ""absolutely realistic"" for the Georgian economy. But recently published research by Policy and Management Consulting Group (PMCG), a Georgian research firm, said that the prospect for the next six months was ""extremely negative"". It highlighted the impact of the continuing political turmoil, and said that the suspension of EU membership talks ""was negatively viewed by all surveyed economists"". Mr Gilauri of Reformatics says their own analysis shows that Georgia's economic growth this year will be zero. ""Going forward, we will have a budgetary problem, a currency exchange problem. We will have an inflation problem. We will have a jobs problem, a job creation problem, and we will have economic decline problem. ""Having new elections is the only way forward for the country as well as for Bidzina Ivanishvili personally."""

Pope Francis, aged 88, was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital last week with a respiratory infection. He has been diagnosed with pneumonia in both lungs. On Wednesday, he was visited by Italy's Prime Minister Georgia Meloni, who said she was ""very happy to have found him alert and responsive. We joked as always. He hasn't lost his proverbial sense of humour"". She offered him best wishes for a speedy recovery, on behalf of the Italian government and the whole country. ""The blood tests, evaluated by the medical staff, show a slight improvement, particularly in inflammatory indices,"" said the Vatican in a statement later on Wednesday. Earlier in the week, the Vatican said medical tests and a chest X-ray showed ""a complex picture"". Pneumonia is a serious infection that can inflame and scar the lungs, causing chest pain and making breathing more difficult. The Vatican said in its latest update on the pontiff's fragile health that he was alert and ate breakfast. A Vatican official said the Pope was still able to get out of bed and sit in an armchair in his hospital room, and he was continuing to do some work. He has cancelled a papal audience scheduled for Saturday and is not well enough to attend Mass on Sunday. Outside the hospital, well-wishers and pilgrims have continued to gather to pray, light candles and write notes of encouragement."

""I immediately thought of a sci-fi movie where it looked like a troop formation about to attack,"" Simon Eriksson, a workman from Malmo, told the Swedish state broadcaster. The pyrotechnics were in fact caused by a Space X Falcon 9 rocket re-entering the Earth's atmosphere. There are reports of sightings in Denmark, Sweden and England. Pieces of the rocket then crashed into Poland and, experts say, may also have landed in Ukraine. At around 10:00 local time (09:00 GMT), Adam Borucki was astonished to find what appeared to be a charred tank measuring around 1.5m by 1m behind his warehouse in Komorniki, Poland. ""When we came to work, we found a total mess with broken power poles in the storage yard,"" Mr Borucki told the BBC. He said that some that some electrical items and a concrete block stored in the warehouse were also damaged. ""I felt surprised but also a little scared. But ultimately, I'm glad no-one was hurt,"" he added. Mr Borucki contacted the police who, working alongside the Polish space agency Polsa, determined that the unidentified object was debris from a Falcon 9 rocket, manufactured by Elon Musk's company SpaceX. ""We are investigating how the object ended up in this location, but the important thing is that no-one was harmed,"" police spokesperson Andrzej Borowiak said. A similar piece of debris was discovered in a forest near the Polish village of Wiry, according to Polish police. Polsa has confirmed that ""an uncontrolled re-entry of the Falcon 9 rocket's second stage occurred between 04:46 and 04:48 on February 19, 2025, over Poland"". The SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket is used to transport people and payloads into the Earth's thermosphere and sometimes beyond. It is designed to be reusable. The rocket which created this debris was launched by SpaceX from the Vandenberg Air Force Base in California on 1 February. ""It was supposed to re-enter the Earth's atmosphere in a controlled manner and crash into the Pacific Ocean,"" Harvard University astrophysicist Dr Jonathan McDowell told the BBC. ""But the engine failed. We've seen it orbiting Earth for the past few weeks and we were anticipating an uncontrolled re-entry today, which is what people saw burning in the sky. ""The debris zipped over England at around 17,000 mph, then parts of Scandinavia then parts crashed into eastern Europe at a few hundred miles an hour."" Space debris from rockets and satellites re-enter the Earth's atmosphere several times a month. Usually pieces of space debris are entirely burned up by Earth's atmosphere but larger piece can fall to earth. According to Dr McDowell, an uncontrolled large rocket re-entry is rare and has the potential to be dangerous. ""So far, we've been lucky and no-one has been hurt but the more we put into the Earth's orbit, the more likely it is that our luck will run out,"" he said. ""This is the fourth incident recently with a SpaceX Falcon which is causing concern. It looks like glitches like this engine failure are becoming more common."" So far large pieces of debris have been confirmed in Poland but Dr McDowell suspects that pieces have crashed into western Ukraine where the comet-like streaks of light in the sky ""were clearly visible"". ""It's quite the omen for how our civilisation is changing,"" he added. The BBC has approached Space X for comment."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8d4pl7lemyo,Russian mafia money-laundering ring broken up in Spain,2025-02-19T18:30:33.327Z,Eve Webster,"Fourteen people have been arrested in Spain and Portugal in a series of raids targeting a €1tn (£828bn) criminal, money-laundering network working with gangs across Europe. Most of the suspects, detained last month, are Russian nationals, according to EU law enforcement agency Europol. The ring mainly laundered money originating from illegal drug trafficking and charged 2-3% commission per transfer as part of ""a genuine multinational money laundering company"", according to Spain's National Police. Nine properties were raided in cities across Spain, as well as the Portuguese capital Lisbon, and more than €1m in cash and cryptocurrencies were seized. The gang operated in cities across Spain with each office processing as much as €300,000 a day for Albanian, Serbian, Armenian, Chinese, Ukrainian and Colombian mafias based within the EU and elsewhere. The investigation began in 2023 when police noticed that several known members of the Russian mafia were systematically transferring money belonging to foreign nationals in and out of Spain on a daily basis. Europol said the scheme used the ""Hawala"" method which involves customers in one location approaching a broker who then contacts a colleague in another location who transfers the desired amount to the recipient. This allowed gangs to transfer money across countries without moving it either physically or digitally between bank accounts. The gang also looked into expanding its business to Cuba with the aim of installing solar panels to provide energy to the Cuban government in exchange for minerals. During phone-calls with Cuban officials, gang members claimed to have close links to Spanish political leaders. Each of the raided properties in Madrid, Málaga, Marbella, Torremolinos, Coín, Ayamonte and Lisbon contained a high-security safe and a money-counting machine stored in a sound-proof cabinet used to obscure the recognisable noise of the money counters. Gang members avoided detection by regularly changing location and vehicles and using encrypted mobile phones. The phones were linked in such a way that should a member of the group be arrested, the mobile phones of the entire ring would be simultaneously locked down. Police say the three ringleaders remain in custody and say other arrests are possible."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9814k2jlxko,Fact-checking Trump claims about war in Ukraine,2025-02-19T17:48:12.825Z,Matt Murphy & Jake Horton,"US President Donald Trump has appeared to accuse Ukraine of being responsible for the war with Russia, in a flurry of claims from his Mar-a-Lago mansion in Florida. Speaking to reporters, Trump also made claims about President Volodymyr Zelensky's popularity and observed that Ukraine had yet to hold scheduled elections due to martial law. He later doubled down on those comments in a fiery Truth Social post on Wednesday. Trump's accusations - some of which appeared to mirror common Russian talking points about the war - came just hours after US officials met a Russian delegation in Riyadh to open talks to end the conflict, which has raged for almost three years. Zelensky later accused Trump of ""living in a disinformation space"" created by Russia. BBC Verify has fact-checked Trump's claims. Trump initially drew attention to the fact that Ukraine has not held a presidential election since 2019, when Zelensky - previously a comedian with no political base - swept to power. He repeated the claims in a Truth Social post in which he accused the Ukrainian leader of being a ""dictator without elections"". Zelensky's first five-year term of office was due to come to an end in May 2024. However, Ukraine has been under martial law since the Russian invasion in February 2022, which means elections are suspended. Ukraine's martial laws were drafted in 2015 - shortly after Russia annexed the Crimean Peninsula and years before Zelensky and his Servant of the People party came to power. Independent observers from the OSCE said the 2019 election had been ""competitive and fundamental freedoms were generally respected"". Zelensky won 73% of the vote in the second-round run-off. Zelensky has vowed to hold a new election once the conflict ends and has yet to confirm that he intends to stand. Some experts have observed that holding elections in Ukraine before the conflict ends would be practically impossible, as Russian attacks on many cities persist and millions of citizens are displaced abroad or living under Russian occupation. Trump's intervention on the subject came just hours after the Kremlin questioned Zelensky's legitimacy as his term in office has ended, a claim Moscow has repeatedly made in the past months. On 28 January, Russia's President Vladimir Putin called Zelensky ""illegitimate"" in an interview with Russian media. Referring to the electoral situation, Trump appeared aware that it had been a frequent Russian allegation used to undermine Zelensky, saying in his news conference: ""That's not a Russian thing, that's something coming from me, from other countries."" For his part, Zelensky has previously said it would be ""absolutely irresponsible to throw the topic of elections"" in the middle of the conflict. President Trump also claimed that Zelensky's approval rating has fallen to 4%. It's unclear what source the president was citing as he didn't provide evidence. We have asked the White House to clarify this. Official polling is limited and it is extremely difficult to carry out accurate surveys during a time of war. Millions of Ukrainians have fled and Russia has occupied around a fifth of the country. However, some polling has been possible to carry out by telephone. A survey conducted this month found that 57% of Ukrainians said they trusted the president, according to the Ukraine-based Kyiv International Institute of Sociology. However, that was down from 77% at the end of 2023, and 90% in May 2022 - suggesting that the president has suffered a drop-off in his popularity. Some other polls suggest Zelensky trailing his nearest rival, former army chief Valerii Zaluzhnyi, in the first round of any future election, indicating the two would face each other in a run-off. In the wake of Trump's comments, some major Russian media outlets seized on the claim and cited a poll carried out by Ukrainian MP and Zelensky critic, Oleksandr Dubinsky, on Telegram which they claimed backed up Trump's assessment. Dubinsky has been charged with treason in Ukraine, and accused of ""operating at the behest of Russian intelligence"" - which he denies. Ukrainian authorities expressed dissatisfaction over not being part of Tuesday's talks in Riyadh. But Trump dismissed these concerns, telling reporters that Ukraine had had three years to end the war, before appearing to blame Kyiv for starting the conflict. ""You should have never started it,"" he said. The Kremlin has previously accused Ukraine of starting the war against Russia. ""It was they who started the war in 2014. Our goal is to stop this war. And we did not start this war in 2022,"" Russian President Vladimir Putin told US talk show host Tucker Carlson in February 2024. Ukraine didn't start the war. Russia launched a full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, having annexed Crimea in 2014. The annexation came after Ukraine's pro-Russian president was ousted by popular demonstrations. Russia also backed proxy forces who seized areas of eastern Ukraine, and it accused the new government in Kyiv of discrimination and genocide against Russian speakers. The International Court of Justice has rejected Moscow's claims. After the failure of agreements which aimed to end the post-2014 conflict - Russia began a massive build-up of troops on its border with Ukraine in late 2021. Putin launched the invasion on 24 February 2022, stating that the aim of the operation was to ""demilitarise and denazify"" the pro-Western government of Volodymyr Zelensky and prevent the country from joining Nato. In Ukraine's last parliamentary elections, support for far-right candidates was 2%. It should also be noted that Zelensky is Jewish and that his party has been regarded as centrist. And while Nato officials said in 2021 that Ukraine was a candidate to join the Western alliance in the future, it was not part of any formal process. Additional reporting by BBC Monitoring.

Born in 1926, Mr Turski survived the Lodz Ghetto, extermination camp Auschwitz-Birkenau and two death marches as a teenager. Later dedicating himself to history and journalism in post-war Poland, he co-founded Warsaw's landmark Jewish history museum and became president of the International Auschwitz Committee. He drew international attention on the 75th anniversary of Auschwitz's liberation in 2020, when he remarked Auschwitz ""did not fall from the sky"" and warned it could happen again. Mr Turski was born as Moshe Turbowicz and spent much of his childhood in the Polish city of Lodz. After the Nazis conquered Poland in 1940, he and his family were moved to the Jewish ghetto established in the city which was plagued by disease, starvation and forced labour. In 1944, his parents and younger brother were deported to Auschwitz-Birkenau – where Mr Turski, still a teenager, was to arrive two weeks later in one of the last transports from the Lodz Ghetto. Mr Turski's father and brother were killed in the gas chambers, while his mother was sent to work at the Bergen Belsen camp in northern Germany. In January 1945, as Soviet troops advanced, Mr Turski was among the 60,000 prisoners the Nazis forced to walk west in what came to be known as death marches. He first marched to concentration camp Buchenwald and later on to Terezin, where he was liberated on the brink of death from exhaustion and typhus. He said it was as if he had amnesia after leaving Auschwitz, where he did not return for 20 years. ""I could never forget that I was in Auschwitz, because I have a number tattooed on my arm and I see it every day,"" he told Polish outlet Onet. ""However, after the war, I was struck by amnesia... I remembered individual episodes perfectly: arriving at the camp, a few other things, some stories from the death marches. Everything else was blurred, though."" He rejected an offer to migrate west after the war, instead returning home in the hopes of building a socialist Poland. Mr Turski studied history at the University of Wrocław, during which time he took up journalism and worked in political communications. In 1958, he became editor of the magazine Polityka's history section, from which he went on to become an influential journalist and historian. Mr Turski drew international attention at the 75th anniversary of the liberation of Auschwitz in 2020, remarking that Auschwitz ""did not fall from the sky"". It approached ""with small steps until what happened here, happened,"" he said. He said the Eleventh Commandment of the Bible should be ""thou shalt not be indifferent"". ""Because if you are indifferent, before you know it, another Auschwitz will come out of the blue for you or your descendants,"" he warned. He was one of four survivors who spoke again at the 80th anniversary in January. He warned world leaders gathered by the gates of the camp that ""we can observe a significant rise of antisemitism in today's world, and yet it was precisely antisemitism that led to the Holocaust"". Poland's chief rabbi, Michael Schudrich, said the Jewish community would miss Mr Turski greatly. ""Marian was our teacher, he was our moral voice and mentor. ""He was steeped in Jewish wisdom and used it to guide us on how to face today's problems. We are so blessed that we had Marian with us for so many years."" Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk said Mr Turski's words had become ""a motto for us"". He wrote on X: ""The 11th Commandment for these difficult times."" Polityka magazine called Mr Turski ""an extraordinary man, a witness to the ages, our friend"" whose voice was heard ""all over the world""."

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0n5e1pdz9o,Trump says Ukraine could have made a deal earlier,2025-02-19T09:09:12.398Z,Bernd Debusmann,"Donald Trump has taken aim at Ukraine after its President, Volodymyr Zelensky, said it was a ""surprise"" his country had not been invited to talks in Saudi Arabia on ending the war with Russia. Saying he was ""disappointed"" by Ukraine's reaction, he appeared to blame Ukraine for starting the war, saying the country ""could have made a deal"" earlier. A full-scale Russian invasion sparked the war in Ukraine almost three years ago. Earlier on Tuesday, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov met US Secretary of State Marco Rubio in Riyadh for the first high-level, face-to-face talks between the two countries since the invasion, and agreed to appoint teams to start negotiating the end of the war. Lavrov said his country would not accept peacekeeping forces from Nato countries in Ukraine under any peace deal, a proposal raised at a meeting of European members of Nato in Paris on Monday. European Nato states, who remain committed to supporting Ukraine against Russia, have been smarting at being sidelined by Trump's unilateral peace initiative, which reversed the resolutely pro-Ukraine policy of his predecessor as president, Joe Biden. Following what he referred to as ""the infamous meeting"" - to which Ukraine was not invited either - Zelensky accused the Russian delegation in Riyadh of lying, adding that Russia could not be trusted and ""must be pressured for peace"". Speaking to reporters at his Mar-a-Lago residence, Trump was asked by BBC News what his message was to Ukrainians who might feel betrayed. ""I hear that they're upset about not having a seat, well, they've had a seat for three years and a long time before that. This could have been settled very easily,"" he said. ""You should have never started it. You could have made a deal,"" he later added. ""I could have made a deal for Ukraine,"" he said. ""That would have given them almost all of the land, everything, almost all of the land - and no people would have been killed, and no city would have been demolished."" After the meeting in Riyadh, Trump said he was ""much more confident"". ""They were very good,"" he said. ""Russia wants to do something. They want to stop the savage barbarianism."" ""I think I have the power to end this war,"" he added. Trump also criticised the length of time since an election was held in Ukraine, when asked if the US would support Russian demands for one to be held. ""They want a seat at the table, but... wouldn't the people of Ukraine have a say? It's been a long time since we've had an election,"" the president responded. He also claimed Zelensky - who won a five-year term in 2019 - was ""down at 4% approval rating"". Zelensky has remained in office while the country has been under martial law following the onset of the conflict. One opinion poll in December suggested 52% of Ukrainians surveyed said they ""trust"" Zelensky. Meanwhile, when asked about the prospect of European countries sending troops to Ukraine, Trump said: ""If they want to do that, that's great, I'm all for it."" However, he added of a potential US deployment of troops: ""We won't have to put any over there because, you know, we're very far away."" After Monday's meeting in Paris, British Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said any Ukraine peace deal would require a ""US backstop"" to deter Russia from attacking its neighbour again. Sir Keir said a ""US security guarantee was the only way to effectively deter Russia"", and vowed to discuss the ""key elements"" of a peace deal with Trump in Washington next week. Also at the talks in Riyadh were US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff and US National Security Advisor Mike Waltz, as well as Russian presidential aide Yury Ushakov and the head of Russia's sovereign wealth fund, Kirill Dmitriev. Stressing that Moscow would not agree to peacekeeping forces from Nato countries in Ukraine under any peace deal, Lavrov said: ""Any appearance by armed forces under some other flag does not change anything. It is of course completely unacceptable."" He said the US and Russia would appoint ambassadors to each other's countries as soon as possible and create conditions to ""restore co-operation in full"". ""It was a very useful conversation. We listened to each other, and we heard each other,"" he said. He reiterated Russia's previous position that any expansion of the Nato defence alliance - and Ukraine joining it - would be a ""direct threat"" to Russia. Rubio for his part said he was ""convinced"" Russia was ""willing to begin to engage in a serious process"" to end the conflict. ""There has to be concessions made by all sides. We're not going to predetermine what those are."" ""Today is the first step of a long and difficult journey, but an important one"", he added. Rubio said the European Union was going to ""have to be at the table at some point because they have sanctions as well that have been imposed"". On the absence of Ukraine at the meeting, he insisted ""no-one is being sidelined"". ""Everyone involved in that conflict has to be OK with it, it has to be acceptable to them,"" he added. The talks in Paris, which were hastily arranged in response to the apparent rapprochement between Russia and the US under Trump, did not agree a unified position. Germany's Chancellor Olaf Scholz said discussing sending troops to Ukraine at present was ""completely premature"". Poland's Prime Minister Donald Tusk also said he did not intend to send troops while Italy's Giorgia Meloni - the only European leader to attend Trump's inauguration - expressed doubts. She told the meeting in Paris that deploying European troops would be ""the most complex and the least effective"" way of securing peace in Ukraine. Ukraine's leader looked visibly tired and upset when he gave his reaction to the Riyadh meeting during a news conference in Turkey. ""We want everything to be fair and so that nobody decides anything behind our back,"" Zelensky said. ""You cannot make decisions without Ukraine on how to end the war in Ukraine."" He will be alarmed by all the smiles on both American and Russian faces in Riyadh, but he will know that he can do little to change whatever they agree on over his head. The Ukrainian president will also know that his country's chances of resisting - let alone defeating - Russian troops without American help are very slim. Following the overthrow of Ukraine's pro-Russian president in 2014, Moscow annexed the Black Sea peninsula of Crimea and backed pro-Russian separatists in bloody fighting in eastern Ukraine. The conflict burst into all-out war when Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February 2022. Moscow's attempts to take control of the capital Kyiv were thwarted, but Russian forces have taken around one-fifth of Ukraine's territory in the east and south, and have carried out air strikes across the country. Ukraine has retaliated with artillery and drone strikes, as well as a ground offensive against Russia's western Kursk region. Accurate casualty counts are hard to come by but it is estimated that hundreds of thousands of people, most of them soldiers, have been killed or injured, and millions of Ukrainian civilians have fled as refugees.

This week, 2,500 UK troops from the Army's high readiness force, the First Division, have been taking part in a large Nato exercise in Romania - on a training area just 16 miles (25km) from the border with Ukraine. Although mobile phones have been banned on the exercise, most soldiers are aware that there are now initial discussions to send troops to Ukraine itself. Brigadier Andy Watson, who is commanding the British contribution to the Nato exercise, says his brigade ""is absolutely ready"" should they receive orders to deploy to Ukraine. Earlier this week Keir Starmer said that he was ready and willing to send British troops to Ukraine to help guarantee its security, should there be a ceasefire. But so far he too is unclear as to what they might be asked to do. In terms of numbers of troops that might be needed, Brigadier Watson said ""clearly what the force package would look like would be dependent on what the prime minister and the Ministry of Defence would like"". But he said ""it's absolutely not"" something the UK could do on its own. ""I think the prime minister has been very clear that the UK would contribute to efforts, but absolutely not doing it on our own,"" says Brigadier Watson. Exercise Steadfast Dart is Nato's largest exercise this year and meant to demonstrate how quickly allies can come to the defence of an ally under attack. But while it's meant to demonstrate Nato's readiness, it also highlights its limitations too. The UK has shown it can move large numbers of troops and equipment, including more than 700 military vehicles, 1,400 miles (2,253 km) across Europe at relatively short notice as part of Nato's new Allied Reaction Force. And that it can operate alongside allies. More than 10,000 military personnel are taking part in the exercise from eight European nations. But that is just 10% of the number that most military experts believe might be required for any peacekeeping operation inside Ukraine which might require a force of more than 100,000. Some of the nations taking part, like Spain and Italy, have not even met Nato's own spending target for defence of 2% of GDP, set more than a decade ago. Many, including the UK, have experienced recent cuts in the size of their armed forces. When British forces were sent to Helmand in 2009, the British Army had more than 100,000 regular troops. Now it is at its smallest since the Napoleonic wars, at just over 70,000. Even before the cuts, the British Army was stretched sending a force of 9,000 troops. It required additional defence spending for urgent operational equipment, as well as a rolling deployment of fresh troops every six months. A regular Army of around 73,000 would now struggle to do something on a similar scale. Steadfast Dart is meant to show that Nato's European allies can respond to a crisis. Unusually, for a large Nato military exercise, US forces are not directly involved. But America remains Nato's most powerful and largest military member and its absence from any plan to guarantee Ukraine's security would leave a gaping hole. That's why Keir Starmer and his Defence Secretary John Healey are calling for the US to be involved, despite the Trump administration's insistence that there will be no US boots on the ground. Healey said on Tuesday that European nations would have to play a leading role but he added that ""it is only the US that can provide the deterrence to Putin that will prevent him attacking again"". Nato's intervention in Libya in 2011 illustrated how European nations struggled without their biggest partner. The US was supposed to take a back seat in the bombing campaign but was still heavily relied on for logistics - air-to-air refuelling - and providing intelligence and surveillance. Back at Exercise Steadfast Dart, Colonel Gordon Muir, who commands 4 Scots troops and previously fought alongside the US in Afghanistan, said ""there's a famous Highland saying - that friends are good on the day of battle"". He said there are few circumstances when you want to go it alone. Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine should have been the wake-up call that European nations needed. Most of its members are now spending 2% of their GDP on defence. But Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte now says that is not enough and is pushing for more than 3%. The Trump administration says it should be more like 5% of GDP. The UK government has still not set a date for its new spending target of 2.5%. Europe has also been slow to ramp up defence production. But Exercise Steadfast Dart shows that some lessons are being learned from the war in Ukraine. There is an emphasis on trench and urban warfare as well as combatting drones. We watch British and Romanian troops repeat drills of clearing a recently excavated zigzag of snow-covered trench lines. Many of the British troops taking part in this training have also recently been helping train their Ukrainian counterparts in the UK. Corporal Richard Gillin, of 4 Scots, told me, ""we're definitely ready for Ukraine"". Though they do not know whether such a deployment would happen - or what role they might be asked to perform - any operation in Ukraine would give the British Army a new sense of purpose and help with its recruitment crisis. Lance Corporal Lewis Antwis, of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards, said ""people have joined the Army for a purpose…so yeah, I think the boys would be ready""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg151j5504o,Jeremy Bowen: No sign of a quick peace dividend for Trump in Ukraine,2025-02-18T20:24:12.953Z,Jeremy Bowen,"The Russians and Americans are talking again, as European leaders and diplomats contemplate the hard choices forced on them by US President Donald Trump. Without question, Trump's diplomatic ultimatum to Ukraine and America's Western European allies has cracked the transatlantic alliance, perhaps beyond repair. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky looks rattled by the abrupt change of attitude coming from the White House, though some of his many critics at home say he should have seen it coming. Well before he won re-election, Donald Trump made it clear that he was not going to continue Joe Biden's policies. As he arrived in Turkey on his latest trip, Zelensky deplored the fact that negotiations to end the war were happening ""behind the back of key parties affected by the consequences of Russian aggression"". But it feels like a long way from the air-conditioned room in Saudi Arabia where the Russian and American delegations faced each other across a broad and highly polished mahogany table, to the bitter cold of north-eastern Ukraine. In dug-outs and military bases here in the snow-bound villages and forests on the border with Russia, Ukrainian soldiers are getting on with business as usual – fighting the war. In an underground bunker at a base in the forest somewhere near Sumy, a Ukrainian officer told me he didn't have much time to follow the news. As far as he was concerned, Donald Trump's decision to talk to Russia's president Vladimir Putin was ""just noise"". The commander, who asked to be referred to only by his call sign ""White"" has more pressing matters to consider. Ignoring the diplomatic bombshell that has rattled Western leaders, as well as his own president, is probably the right thing to do for a battlefield officer preparing to lead his men back into the fight. Soon they will cross back into Kursk, to rejoin the fight to keep the land Ukraine has seized from Russia. As a condition of access to Ukrainian soldiers, we agreed not to disclose precise locations or identities, except to say they are in the borderlands around the town of Sumy, and all part of Ukraine's continuing fight in Kursk. In a small room in a workshop tucked away in a village there was a formidable display of killing power on shelves made of planks from the sawmill propped up by wooden ammunition boxes. On the shelves were hundreds of drones, all made in Ukraine. Each one costs around £300 ($380). The soldiers who were checking them before packing them into cardboard boxes to send them into the Kursk battlefields said that when they are armed – and flown by a skilled pilot – they could even destroy a tank. One of them, called Andrew, was a drone pilot until his leg was blown off. He said he hadn't thought too hard about what had been said far from here by the Americans – but none of them trusted President Vladimir Putin. Their drones a few hours earlier had destroyed a Russian armoured unit advancing in broad daylight across a frozen snow-covered field. They showed us the video. Some of the vehicles they hit were flying the red banner of the Soviet Union instead of the Russian flag. Sumy is busy enough during the day, with shops open and well-stocked. But once it gets dark the streets are almost deserted. Air raid alerts come frequently. Anti-aircraft guns fire tracer into the sky for hours, aimed at the waves of Russian drones that cross the border near here to attack targets much deeper inside Ukraine – and sometimes in Sumy itself. A big block of flats has a hole three storeys high ripped out of it. Eleven people were killed here in a Russian drone attack a fortnight or so ago. Since then, the block has been evacuated as engineers fear it is so badly damaged it might collapse. It is part of a housing estate of identical monumental blocks built during the Soviet era. Residents still living next to the wrecked and unsafe building were going about their business, walking to the shops or their cars, swaddled against the intense cold. Mykola, a man of 50, stopped to talk as he was walking home with his young son. He lives in the next block to the one the Russians destroyed. I asked him what he thought of Donald Trump's idea of peace in Ukraine. ""We need peace,"" he said. ""It's necessary because there is no point in war. War doesn't lead to anything. If you look at how much territory Russia has occupied so far, for the Russians to eventually get to Kyiv, they'll have to keep fighting for 14 years. It's only the people who are suffering. It needs to end."" But no deal worth having, Mykola believed, would emerge from Putin and Trump sitting together without Zelensky and the Europeans. Yuliia, 33, another neighbour, was out walking her Jack Russell. She was at home when the Russians attacked the block of flats next door. ""It all happened just past midnight, when we were about to go to bed. We heard a loud explosion, and we saw a massive red flash through our window. We saw this horror. It was very scary. ""Many people were outside. And I remember there was a woman hanging out – she was screaming for help – we couldn't see her immediately but eventually she was saved from the debris."" Peace is possible, she believes, ""but they need to stop bombing us first. There can only be peace when they stop doing that. It needs to come from their side because they started this horror. ""Of course, you can't trust Putin."" As the last rays of the sun disappeared, Borys, a spry and upright retired colonel of 70 who served 30 years in the Soviet army stopped on his way to his car. His son and grandson, he said, are both in uniform fighting for Ukraine. ""Peace is possible,"" he said. ""But I don't really believe in it. I think that justice will prevail for Ukraine. You have to be cautious. ""While Putin is there, you cannot trust Russians. Because they believe in him as if he is a religion. You won't change them. It needs time."" So what's the answer – keep fighting or a peace deal? ""Ukraine needs to think about peace. But we shouldn't surrender. I don't see any point. We will resist until we are stronger. Europe seems like they are ready to help us. There is just no point in surrendering."" Donald Trump, a man who seems convinced that the principles of a real-estate deal can be applied to ending a war will discover that making peace is much more complicated than just getting a ceasefire and deciding how much land each side keeps. President Putin has made very clear that he wants to break Ukraine's sovereignty and destroy its ability to act as an independent nation. Whether or not Ukraine's President Zelensky has a seat at President Trump's conference table, he won't agree to that. Making a peace that lasts, if it's possible, will be a long and slow process. If Donald Trump wants a quick peace dividend, he should look elsewhere."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q4gw45nvdo,Moscow back at the table - and appearing to call the shots,2025-02-18T20:01:46.086Z,Sarah Rainsford,"The sight of senior Russian and American officials back around a giant negotiating table is extraordinary. For many, most of all Ukrainians, it will have been very hard to take. In Saudi Arabia, Moscow achieved something major: after three years of all-out war on its neighbour and isolation by the West, it was back at the ""top table"" of global diplomacy. Not only that, Russia looked for all the world like it was the one calling the shots. Even as air raid sirens continue to sound across Ukraine, that's exactly the image Moscow wants to project. This was not a defeated Russia, forced to the negotiating table. It was more like the US inviting the aggressor to set out its terms. True, US officials went into the process saying they wanted to feel out Russia, check whether it's serious about peace. But Donald Trump had already drawn his conclusions. Last week, after he spoke to Vladimir Putin by phone, he announced that the Russian leader ""wants to see people stop dying"". Trump could have responded by telling him to withdraw all his troops. Instead, he clearly wants to cut a deal with Moscow to end the war, as he promised voters, and move on. After more than four hours of talks in Riyadh, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio emerged to the press and announced the first steps towards negotiations had been agreed, with teams to be formed on both sides. He'd concluded that Russia was ready to engage in a ""serious process"" to end the war. But why was he so sure? Across the table was Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov, still under sanctions for what the US Treasury called Russia's ""brutal war of choice"". When Lavrov met the Russian media, he told them the US had proposed a moratorium on attacking energy infrastructure. ""We explained that we have never endangered the civilian energy supply and only target what directly serves Ukraine's military,"" was the minister's reply. That's not true. I have personally walked through the ruins of civilian power plants that have been directly targeted by Russian missiles. This is the country that the US is attempting to engage with, although there is ample evidence that it can't be trusted. Russia has also shown zero sign of conceding any ground: why would it, when the Trump administration has already agreed that Ukraine will never join Nato, as Moscow demands, and won't get its occupied land back? That's why, for Ukraine's allies, it won't only be the image of US and Russian officials seated at the shiny Saudi table that jarred. It's also how they talked. ""Laying the ground"" for future investment sounds like a promise of dropping sanctions: no reckoning for Russia's war of aggression, then, just reward. These are, of course, the earliest of early days. But in Moscow, officials and state media sense the start of Russia's return to where it believes it belongs: face to face with the US, as an equal."

The 88-year-old has been suffering from a respiratory infection for more than a week and was admitted to Rome's Gemelli hospital on Friday. ""The follow-up chest CT scan which the Holy Father underwent this afternoon... demonstrated the onset of bilateral pneumonia, which required additional drug therapy,"" the Vatican said. It said lab tests, a chest X-ray and the Pope's clinical condition ""continue to present a complex picture"". Despite this, the Vatican said the pontiff remained in ""good spirits"" and spent the day ""reading, resting and praying"". Pope Francis also expressed his gratitude to well-wishers and asked them to ""pray for him"". Before his admission last week, the Pope had bronchitis symptoms for several days and had delegated officials to read prepared speeches at events. He had been due to lead several events over the weekend for the 2025 Catholic Holy Year which runs through to next January, however all public events on the Pope's calendar have been cancelled through to Sunday. On Monday, the Vatican said that doctors had changed the Pope's drug therapy for the second time during his hospital stay to tackle what at the time was thought to be a ""polymicrobial infection of the respiratory tract"". The Pope is especially prone to lung infections due to developing pleurisy as an adult and having part of one of his lungs removed at age 21. During his 12 years as leader of the Roman Catholic church, the Argentine has been hospitalised several times including in March 2023 when he spent three nights in hospital with bronchitis."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd7ev3wygl4o,Francis Ford Coppola named worst director at Razzies,2025-02-28T17:33:16.176Z,Noor Nanji,"Francis Ford Coppola, one of Hollywood's greatest filmmakers, has been named worst director for his self-financed project Megalopolis in this year's Razzies. Announced two days before the Oscars reward Hollywood's finest, the Razzie Awards name and shame the year's worst films. In an Instagram post, Coppola said he was ""thrilled"" to accept the award, ""at a time when so few have the courage to go against the prevailing trends of contemporary movie-making"". Madame Web picked up the award for worst picture, screenplay and actress for its star Dakota Johnson, while Joker: Folie à Deux also collected two awards. The organisers have described their awards as the ""ugly cousin to the Oscars"". Megalopolis, an epic fantasy starring Adam Driver, Shia LaBeouf, Aubrey Plaza and Nathalie Emmanuel, cost Coppola a reported $120m (£95m). It also faced controversy after the trailer was withdrawn by studio Lionsgate, because the clip included fabricated quotes from real film critics about the filmmaker's previous works. ""Even a cinematic maestro occasionally musters up a misfire,"" the Razzies said, in a press release announcing Coppola's win. It comes almost exactly 50 years after Coppola won a best director Oscar for The Godfather part II. In his Instagram post, Coppola said: ""In this wreck of a world today, where art is given scores as if it were professional wrestling, I chose to not follow the gutless rules laid down by an industry so terrified of risk that despite the enormous pool of young talent at its disposal, may not create pictures that will be relevant and alive 50 years from now."" He concluded his post by thanking everyone who worked on the film, adding: ""Box office is only about money, and like war, stupidity and politics has no true place in our future."" Elsewhere, Madame Web, the fourth film in Sony's Spider-Man Universe, picked up three awards after being branded a ""tangled mess"" by critics. Starring Johnson and Sydney Sweeney, both the film premise and the acting came under fire in a string of one-star reviews. Based on Marvel Comics, the film centres around a paramedic with arachnid-based psychic powers. The trailer went viral in 2023 for its ""laughably unsure tone"". Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off or Sequel and Worst Screen Combo were both ""won"" by Joker: Folie à Deux. The film, starring Joaquin Phoenix, was a much-anticipated sequel to its predecessor, 2019's Joker, but it largely disappointed critics. There was better news, however, for Pamela Anderson, who earned this year's Razzie halo for her role as a fading dancer in The Last Showgirl. Other winners include Jon Voight as Worst Supporting Actor for Megalopolis, Reagan, Shadow Land and Strangers, as well as Jerry Seinfeld (Worst Actor) and Amy Schumer (Supporting Actress) both for Unfrosted."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9v1l80350o,Trump to order English as official US language,2025-02-28T16:40:24.021Z,Caitlin Wilson,"Donald Trump will sign an executive order on Friday making English the official language of the United States, according to White House officials. The US president is also expected to scrap requirements that federal agencies provide language services to non-English speakers. The US has never had an official language in the nearly 250 years since the country was founded. The order is intended to improve government efficiency and promote national unity, according to White House officials. Nearly 68 million of the country's 340 million residents speak a language other than English, according to the US Census Bureau, which includes more than 160 Native American tongues. Friday's executive order will roll back a policy from 2000 signed by former President Bill Clinton requiring government agencies and federal funding recipients to ""ensure that their programs and activities normally provided in English are accessible to LEP (low-English proficiency) persons"". Agencies will still be allowed to provide that language access to non-English speakers, according to White House officials. Republicans have led efforts in the past to label English as the country's official language, with members of the House as recently as 2021 introducing legislation on it that failed. Those who opposed those efforts say that the country does not need an official language, pointing to the high numbers of people who speak it and to the country never having one, while also saying establishing one could promote discrimination against non-English speakers. During his presidential campaign last year, Trump included non-English languages in his statements calling for stricter immigration policies. ""We have languages coming into our country. We don't have one instructor in our entire nation that can speak that language,"" he told a crowd of supporters in February 2024. ""It's the craziest thing - they have languages that nobody in this country has ever heard of. It's a very horrible thing,"" he said. And during the 2016 campaign he said, ""This is a country where we speak English. It's English. You have to speak English!"" When the US was founded, most residents spoke English and those writing the country's constitution did not feel it was necessary to enshrine it as the official language and also did not want to alienate fellow new citizens who spoke German or other languages, according to most scholars. The languages currently spoken the most in the US after English are Spanish, various Chinese languages, Tagolog, Vietnamese and Arabic, according to the Census Bureau. A further approximately one million people use American Sign Language, according to experts. Approximately 180 countries around the world designate official national languages, and most countries recognise multiple official languages. However, several countries besides the US do not have an official language, including the United Kingdom. There are more than 30 US states which have designated English as the official language, while Alaska and Hawaii have also bestowed official status on several native languages."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clydd7zeye7o,US judge says mass firings of some federal workers likely illegal,2025-02-28T15:01:53.807Z,Ana Faguy,"A California judge has said the mass firings of probationary employees by the Trump administration were likely unlawful. The ruling said the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) had told thousands of employees across a handful of federal agencies they were fired using authority the agency does not have, US District Judge William Alsup ruled. ""[OPM] does not have any authority whatsoever, under any statute in the history of the universe, to hire and fire employees at another agency,"" he said. ""They can hire and fire their own employees."" In court the government argued OPM asked, not ordered, the agencies to fire these employees. They also argued that probationary employees are not guaranteed employment and that only the highest performing and mission-critical employees should be hired. Government workers have been the target of the Trump administration's efforts to reduce the federal workforce in the name of cutting costs. Many employees affected by the firings are probationary employees - usually those in their first or second year in a job - though they can sometimes be long-time employees who were recently promoted. There are some 200,000 probationary employees in the federal workforce. Judge Alsup ordered OPM to revoke its directives to multiples agencies - including the Department of Veterans Affairs, the National Park Service, and the Defence Department - to terminate employees. He issued a temporary restraining order which puts a momentary pause on the government's actions until a judge revisits the matter in the coming weeks. The case began after a coalition of labour unions and non-profit organisations sued the government, arguing OPM unlawfully fired individuals by falsely claiming workers were performing poorly. Everett Kelley, the National President of the American Federation of Government Employees, called the ruling a victory for Americans were were ""illegally fired"" from their jobs by an agency with ""no authority to do so"". ""These are rank-and-file workers who joined the federal government to make a difference in their communities, only to be suddenly terminated due to this administration's disdain for federal employees and desire to privatize their work,"" he said. OPM declined the BBC's request for comment."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7xxlr2pggo,Eleven things Trump and his team did this week,2025-02-28T21:30:04.821Z,Robert Plummer and Nadine Yousif,"President Donald Trump continued to play the global disruptor this week, while the rest of the world did its best to engage with him. His sixth week in office saw developments at home and abroad, as the US president hosted foreign leaders at the White House, including the UK's Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer. The wars in Ukraine and Gaza also loomed large, in sometimes surprising ways. A tense exchange between Trump and Ukrainian President Volodmyr Zelensky capped the week off on Friday, resulting in their White House meeting being cut abruptly short. If you are after a catch-up, here is a reminder of 11 major moves from the Trump administration this week. One of the most remarkable moments of the week was an angry exchange between Zelensky and Trump at the Oval Office that unfolded in front of the world's news cameras. During what was supposed to be a prelude to the two leaders signing a minerals deal, the conversation between the two soured, and culminated with the US president telling his Ukrainian counterpart to make a deal with Russia ""or we are out"". The exchange first became heated after US Vice-President JD Vance told Zelensky that the war had to be ended through diplomacy. Zelensky then asked what kind of diplomacy, to which Vance accused him of being disrespectful and of ""litigating"" the situation in front of the media. It escalated quickly from there. Trump told Zelensky that he should be ""thankful"" for the US support his country has received in its fight against Russia, and that he was ""gambling with World War Three."" The Ukrainian president was then told to leave the White House by National Security Adviser Mike Waltz and Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and a joint news conference with Trump and Zelensky was cancelled. In a Truth Social post afterwards, Trump said ""Zelensky disrespected the US in its cherished Oval Office."" ""He can come back when he is ready for peace,"" Trump said. Ahead of that meeting, Ukraine and the US had drafted a deal that would give the US access to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals. Zelensky had said he hoped the ""preliminary"" agreement with the US would ""lead to further deals"", but confirmed no American security guarantees had been agreed yet. Notably, Trump on Thursday appeared to walk back his harsh criticism of Zelensky, whom he called a ""dictator"" last week. Asked about it on Thursday, Trump replied: ""Did I say that? I can't believe I would say that."" But Friday's meeting, which ended up being cut short even before the two parties had begun negotiations, ended with no deal signed. Trump held his first cabinet meeting on Wednesday. Among those present was the president's billionaire adviser Elon Musk, who is not actually a cabinet member. A big topic was the plan by Doge - the so-called Department of Government Efficiency, which Musk runs - to cut the size of the federal bureaucracy. On the same day of the meeting, a memo was sent to federal agencies asking them to submit plans for ""a significant reduction"" in their staff by 13 March. French President Emmanuel Macron was the first foreign visitor to come to the White House this week. Trump hosted Macron on Monday, the third anniversary of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. After the meeting, Macron said Trump had ""good reason"" to re-establish communication with Russia's President Vladimir Putin - a notable departure from France's previous policy of isolating him. But he did not get a commitment from Trump that the US would help Europe with its security needs. UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer also met the US president this week. The two discussed trade and US security guarantees for Ukraine. Trump said there was a ""very good chance"" of a trade deal between the US and the UK where ""tariffs wouldn't be necessary"". Such a deal, Trump said, could be made ""pretty quickly"". Part way through their opening remarks, Sir Keir reached inside his jacket pocket and pulled out an official letter from King Charles - an invitation for a second state visit. Trump appeared to be genuinely taken aback for a few seconds, asking: ""Am I supposed to read it right now?"" After taking a minute to read the letter, Trump said he accepted the invite and that it would be an ""honour"" to visit the ""fantastic"" country. Trump shared a controversial AI-generated video of Gaza, appearing to depict the besieged enclave as a Mediterranean resort run and operated by the US president. The clip, which sparked a social media frenzy, came after Trump had stated his administration's controversial plan to take over Gaza and rebuild it into the ""riviera"" of the Middle East. The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) announced a $1bn (£792m) plan to help US farmers combat a raging bird flu epidemic that has required them to kill millions of chickens and pushed the cost of eggs to an all-time high. Officials say they will budget $500m for biosecurity measures, roughly $100m for vaccine research and development, and $400m for farmer financial relief programmes. Trump unveiled plans for selling a ""gold card"" visa for $5m (£3.9m) that will offer wealthy buyers permanent residency in the US and a path to citizenship. The president told reporters that the visas would function similarly to green cards, which allow immigrants of varying incomes to live and work permanently in the US, but would go to ""high-level people"". ""The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,"" Trump said. ""It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain."" Republicans in the US House of Representatives narrowly passed a multi-trillion dollar government spending bill on Tuesday, a major boost for Trump that advances his agenda. It includes $4.5 trillion (£3.6tn) in tax cuts, funded partially by spending reductions but also by potentially increasing the US government's substantial debt pile. However, there are still a number of steps the spending plan must go through in order to become law. Trump said he would invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House to celebrate their recent Super Bowl win, despite rumours that the champions might decline the invitation. ""Absolutely, they'll be extended an invitation,"" Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. ""They deserve to be down here, and we hope to see them."" The Eagles skipped a visit to the White House when they won in 2018, but the team plans to attend the event this year, US media reported."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zzd3zp50o,'Trump thinks he can break us' - Ontario's Doug Ford makes bullish victory speech,2025-02-28T11:54:38.680Z,Nadine Yousif,"The leader of Ontario, Doug Ford, has vowed to push back at US President Donald Trump after securing a third term in office as premier of Canada's most populous province. ""Donald Trump thinks he can break us,"" he told the cheering crowds in Toronto, but the US president was mistaken, he added. ""Canada is not for sale."" Ford, who has led Ontario since 2018, called the snap election to get a clear mandate to fight US President Donald Trump over tariffs he threatens to impose on Canadian goods. The indications on Friday morning were that his Progressive Conservatives had won more than 80 seats out of 124 in the legislature.  The left-wing New Democratic Party came second, forming the official opposition, while the Liberals were in third place. Ford pushed back in his election campaign against Trump's persistent references to Canada as the 51st US state, sporting a cap saying ""Canada is not for sale."" In his victory speech at a convention centre in Toronto, he said: ""Donald Trump thinks he can break us. He thinks he can divide and conquer, pit region against region. ""Donald Trump doesn't know what we know. He is underestimating us. He is underestimating the resilience of the Canadian people, the Canadian spirit."" The election was called by the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) 10 minutes after polls closed on Thursday evening. Voter turnout appears to be near historic lows. As of 23:00 local time (04:00 GMT) with 97% of polls reporting, just over 44% of Ontarians had cast ballots in the election. That is essentially tied with the lowest ever turnout of 44% in 2022. Ford ran his campaign under the slogan ""Protect Canada"", reflecting his view that Canada needs to stand firm against US tariff threats. Ford has appeared regularly on US television news networks in recent months as a de-facto spokesman for Canada's position in its fight against the tariffs. President Trump said on Thursday that the tariffs he planned to impose on Canada and Mexico would go ahead next week, after he delayed them a month in exchange for security assurances at the shared borders. Around 75% of Canadian exports go to the US, and economists have warned that the tariffs would be devastating for Canada's economy while raising costs for Americans. Ontario is home to a large automotive sector that is deeply intertwined with the US - car parts often make several trips back and forth across the US-Canada border before a vehicle is fully assembled and sold. Ford has suggested that 500,000 of Ontario's 16 million people could lose their jobs if the US follows through on the blanket 25% tariffs. He has called for strong retaliation, suggesting Canada cut its energy supply to the US and calling for provincial liquor stores to pull American booze from their shelves. He has also proposed the idea of ""Fortress Am-Can"" - a slogan to sell Trump on a stronger energy alliance between the two countries in a bid to avoid tariffs altogether. Opposition parties have criticised Ford for calling the snap election, accusing him of taking advantage of the rift in US-Canada relations to boost his own popularity. They also questioned the decision to push for a costly election amid economic uncertainty. Ford has also been the subject of numerous controversies, including an ongoing criminal investigation into a deal to sell a piece of environmentally protected land for real estate development. At a speech to supporters on Thursday, Bonnie Crombie, leader of the Ontario Liberals, said that while the party fell short of forming a government it should be ""very proud"" of the seats it gained. ""People counted us out. Tonight, you proved them wrong,"" said Crombie, who failed to win her own seat. She vowed to continue on as leader. The last time a government in Ontario formed three consecutive majorities was under Leslie Frost, a Progressive Conservative leader who won his third and final term in 1959."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdell8n14x2o,Hundreds in US climate agency fired in latest cuts,2025-02-28T11:27:09.108Z,Thomas Mackintosh,"Hundreds of National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) staff have been laid off in the latest development in the Trump's administration's efforts to slash the federal workforce. Around 880 workers - including weather forecasters - have had their jobs terminated on Thursday, the BBC's US partner CBS News reported. The cuts come as Elon Musk, as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), continues a push to reduce spending through funding cuts and firings. An NOAA spokesman said the agency would not comment on internal personnel matters. Prior to Thursday's cuts, the NOAA had about 12,000 staffers across the world, including 6,773 who are scientists and engineers, according to the agency's website. ""We continue to provide weather information, forecasts and warnings pursuant to our public safety mission,"" the NOAA spokesman added. NOAA staffers took to social media to announce they had been swept up by the cuts. ""I was fired from my dream of working at NOAA. I'm so sorry to everyone also affected,"" climate scientist Zack Labe wrote on X. He said that he had worked on strengthening the agency's machine learning and AI tools. Californian Democratic Congressman Jared Huffman said people across the US ""depend on NOAA for free, accurate forecasts, severe weather alerts, and emergency information"". NOAA weather data is used by meteorologists, media organisations, commerical forecasting services and other companies to inform the US public about the weather. The agency produces the latest information on temperature, precipitation, air quality, UV index, humidity and more. This data is used extensively in the private sector to fuel popular weather services and websites. ""Most or all private weather companies in US (including forecasts that you see on TV or your favorite app) are built directly atop backbone of taxpayer-funded instrumentation, data, predictive modeling, & forecasts provided by NOAA,"" Daniel Swain, a climate scientist at the University of California, Los Angeles wrote on X. The agency has proved essential during periods of extreme weather conditions as well. The National Hurricane Center and the National Weather Service - housed under NOAA - create models and notify millions of Americans when and how to respond to severe weather events, such as hurricanes and tornadoes. Huffman lamented the loss of ""hundreds of scientists and experts at NOAA"" who helped collect infromation that kept the public safe during dangerous weather events. ""Musk's sham mission is bringing vital programs to a screeching halt. Purging the government of scientists, experts, and career civil servants and slashing fundamental programs will cost lives,"" the congressman said. Miyoko Sakashita, the Center for Biological Diversity's oceans director, said gutting NOAA will ""hamstring essential lifesaving"" programmes. The latest developments come days after US government workers faced widespread confusion following conflicting advice over compliance with a Musk-backed order to list their last week's work in an email or face termination. The message sent to millions of federal employees last Saturday evening came after Musk posted on his social media platform X that government staff would ""shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week"". On Sunday, Musk said in some cases ""we believe non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks"". In a copy of the email obtained by the BBC, employees were asked to respond explaining their accomplishments from the past week in five bullet points - without disclosing classified information. But, key agencies, including the Departments of Defense (DoD), Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice, the Pentagon and the FBI - now led by Trump appointees -instructed employees to ignore the directive. Agencies such as the Department of Transportation, the Secret Service and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency encouraged their staff to comply, according to reports. On Wednesday, Musk reiterated the suggestion that a number of federal employees who did not respond to an email requesting a summary of their achievements from the previous week could be ""dead"" or ""not real people"", but offered no facts to back it up. Speaking at Trump's first cabinet meeting, Musk told reporters: ""I think that email perhaps was best interpreted as a performance review, but actually it was a pulse check review. ""Do you have a pulse? Do you have a pulse? And two neurons. So if you have a pulse and two neurons, you can reply to an email."" Elsewhere on Thursday, a federal judge in San Francisco found that the mass firings of probationary employees were likely unlawful. District Judge William Alsup ordered the Office of Personnel Management to inform certain federal agencies that it had no authority to order the firings of probationary employees, including at the defence department."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqlyy1rld0ko,"Hackman and wife likely died 10 days before bodies found, sheriff says",2025-02-28T22:55:31.879Z,Patrick Jackson,"US investigators are trying to establish how Oscar-winning actor Gene Hackman and his wife, classical pianist Betsy Arakawa, died after the discovery of their bodies at their home in the US state of New Mexico. Officials said on Friday that evidence points to Hackman having been dead since 17 February - 10 days before the couples' bodies were found. Here is what we know so far about the death of a Hollywood legend known for such films as The French Connection and The Conversation. Warning: this article contains details some readers may find upsetting  The bodies of the couple and one of their dogs were found by police on Wednesday at their home in Santa Fe, New Mexico, after a maintenance worker called emergency services. In a recording of the 911 call obtained by the BBC, the emotional caller can be heard telling a dispatcher how he found the two bodies. Hackman, 95, was discovered in a side room near the kitchen while Arakawa, 65, was found in a bathroom, at the property on Old Sunset Trail in Hyde Park. The couple appeared to have been ""dead for quite a while"", said Sheriff Adan Mendoza. Arakawa's body showed signs of ""decomposition"", and ""mummification"" in the hands and feet, a sheriff's detective said. Hackman's remains ""showed obvious signs of death, similar and consistent"" with those on his spouse. A German Shepherd dog owned by the couple was found dead in a bathroom closet near to Arakawa. No cause was given in police statements immediately after the announcement of the deaths. The authorities reported no signs of injury but deemed the deaths ""suspicious enough"" to investigate and did not rule out foul play. A carbon monoxide poisoning test came out negative for both Arakawa and Hackman, the Santa Fe Sheriff's office said on Friday. Near Arakawa's head was a portable heater, which the detective determined could have been brought down in the event that she had abruptly fallen to the ground. An autopsy and toxicology tests have been requested for both Hackman and Arakawa. Authorities said it could be a few months before the results of those are released. The local utility company found no sign of a gas leak in the area and the fire department detected no indication of a carbon monoxide leak or poisoning, according to the search warrant. A prescription bottle and scattered pills lay on the bathroom countertop close to Arakawa's body. Prescription pills found in the home were common medications for thyroid and high blood pressure, according to a search warrant. Hackman was discovered wearing grey tracksuit bottoms, a blue long-sleeve T-shirt and brown slippers. Sunglasses and a walking cane lay next to his body. The detective suspected that the actor had suffered a sudden fall. The circumstances of their death were deemed ""suspicious enough in nature to require a thorough search and investigation"", the search warrant says, because the worker who called emergency services had found the front door of the property open. However, the detective observed no sign of forced entry into the home. Nothing appeared out of place inside. ""There was no indication of a struggle,"" said Sheriff Mendoza. ""There was no indication of anything that was missing from the home or disturbed, you know, that would be indication that there was a crime that had occurred."" Two other, healthy dogs were discovered roaming the property - one inside and one out. Authorities said Hackman's pacemaker last registered activity on 17 February, adding that this gives them a good assumption that was his last day of life. But police said it is unclear who died first - Hackman or Arakawa. The two maintenance workers who found the couple, one of whom called the emergency services, say they last had contact with the couple two weeks earlier. The two said they had sometimes conducted routine work at the property, but rarely ever saw Hackman and Arakawa. They had communicated with them by phone and text, primarily with Arakawa. Hackman's daughter Leslie Anne Hackman told the Mail Online that her father had been in ""very good physical condition"" despite his age, and had not undergone ""any major surgeries"" in recent months. ""He liked to do Pilates and yoga, and he was continuing to do that several times a week,"" she said. ""So he was in good health."" The couple, married in 1991, had had a ""wonderful marriage"", she added. ""I give credit to his wife, Betsy, for keeping him alive,' she said. '[Betsy] took very, very good care of him and was always looking out for his health."""

Inmates press themselves up against the bars to look at us. There are no smiles, only expressionless stares. A man with a tattoo that swirls across his face shouts, ""Where you from, ma'am?"" ""England."" ""Hope you enjoy Estelle,"" he says. ""Do you?"" I ask. ""A lot better than where I was before."" Welcome to the Estelle Supermax Penitentiary in Huntsville, Texas. Concrete watchtowers punctuate the perimeter of this vast space - equivalent in size to almost 3,000 football pitches - and a sign with an image of a red-maned lion and the words Stay Hungry - Feast on Success greets staff and visitors as they enter. The UK government is looking to Estelle prison for ideas - for ways to reduce reoffending and to bring down prisoner numbers in our already overcrowded jails. There's a scheme here they'd like to emulate, which gives inmates the chance to shorten their sentences by having a job while they're inside. Looking to this prison for inspiration might seem a curious choice to many, given Texas executes more people than any other US state. But ministers say by implementing schemes similar to ones used here, UK prisoners will be incentivised to gain qualifications - giving them more chance of employment once released. Just one in five offenders in England and Wales has a job six weeks after being released from custody, the latest stats show. According to the Ministry of Justice, people who are still unemployed six weeks after being released are twice as likely to reoffend as those in employment. No prison in the UK has as many inmates as they do at Estelle. More than 3,000 men in white jail-suits are currently locked up here - from murderers and rapists, to those doing time for lesser crimes like shoplifting and fraud. Two inmates are on death row. Jimmy Delgado is 52 and serving three life sentences for first-degree murder. He's already been inside for 25 years - 13 spent in solitary confinement. He's a large man with muscular shoulders and smiles broadly when we meet in the prison chapel, softly shaking my hand. He tells me he first ended up in prison aged just 16, after carrying out a robbery. He's remorseful for his crimes and says this prison - together with his faith in Jesus - has helped turn his life around by giving him purpose. He now works as a counsellor, supporting offenders who are struggling to cope with life in prison. ""I'm here for taking a life - and I'm here to save multiple lives,"" he says. ""If I can change the dynamic of family life for all these guys that are here then I've done my job - even if I never get out of prison."" Delgado may never be released, but inmates having jobs in prison is one of the reasons why Estelle Supermax Penitentiary is appealing to the UK government. The ""good time credit"" scheme used here gives inmates the opportunity to reduce their time behind bars by participating in courses and studying for qualifications, taking up jobs, and behaving well. Credits earned are then added to the number of days the prisoner has already spent in jail, allowing them to reach their parole eligibility date sooner - when a panel decides if they're suitable for early release. This process depends on the classification of their crime and an assessment by the parole board on their overall rehabilitation. Off the long corridor that runs through the main prison building, inmates are quietly working in a small barbers. Kevin Smith is inside for minor offences. He is meticulously cutting a member of staff's hair with a pair of clippers, and says the good time credit scheme has made him feel positive about his time in prison. ""They helped me see that if I do the right thing and make the right decisions, I can do better in life,"" he says. ""I receive good time by working here, and I can get out earlier with the good time that I received - it works."" The rates of those returning to prison within three years of release have fallen to 20.3% in Texas - a fraction of those in the rest of the United States (68%). The BBC came to Estelle to see their credit scheme in action with UK justice secretary Shabana Mahmood. ""The Texans had a system similar to ours - on the point of collapse, running out of prison places in 2007,"" Ms Mahmood says. ""They've now got a sustainable prison population - but most importantly, they've been able to massively cut the rates of reoffending here. They've got a rate of crime now that they haven't seen since the 1960s."" She believes the Texan credit system is effective - helping prisoners get out of prison early - and stay out. ""It does help prisoners turn their backs on a life of crime."" The Texas prison population is the highest of any state in the US, with 134,668 people in custody in the autumn of 2024 - although over the last couple of decades, since reforms were implemented, that number has reduced by nearly 20%. However, some experts say the good time credit programme is not a magic bullet. ""The incentivisation scheme has little to do with the reforms that helped bring Texas's prison population down in 2007,"" says Michele Deitch, a criminal justice policy lecturer at the University of Texas. ""And by itself it will do little to address the UK's very serious overcrowding problem."" What would make a real difference, she says, would be diverting more people from incarceration in the first place: ""To shorten sentences, to reduce the use of recalls to prison, and to invest more heavily in rehabilitative programs in prison and in programs and services in the community."" As well as incentivisation, the UK government is also considering the use of ""diversion programmes"" - where offenders are sent on rehabilitation courses rather than to jail. This can apply to people with addiction issues or mental health problems. It's what they do here in Texas to reduce the burden on the courts and attempt to sort the root cause of the offence. More people have been put to death in Texas than anywhere else in the US. Since the Supreme Court reinstated capital punishment in 1976, 593 prisoners have been executed. There are 176 people currently on death row - so it might seem strange the UK government could take a leaf out of their book. Even so, the justice secretary believes there is still much the UK can learn from what happens at Estelle. ""I don't think that the fact that they have the death penalty here means that we shouldn't be learning lessons from strategies that they've introduced that really work,"" Ms Mahmood says. It's a plan with ""huge potential in the UK"" according to Nick Hardwick, a former chief inspector of prisons, who believes it will make prisons safer and more productive. ""It will help ensure prisoners are doing what is necessary to reduce the risk they will reoffend and create more victims,"" he says. But not everyone agrees with incentivising convicted criminals to work towards an early release from prison. Samantha Nicholls' son was murdered in 2018. Twenty-two year old Joe Pooley was thrown into a river in Ipswich and held under the water. Three people were jailed for his murder in 2021. Joe's mother believes inmates should never be released before their sentence is complete. ""Prison is a punishment - you should do your time,"" she says. ""It needs to be a deterrent - you're there because you did something wrong."" It's clear the UK needs to find solutions to cut prison overcrowding – and find them fast. Even the recent prisoner early release scheme will barely keep pace with more offenders being jailed. New prison buildings will take years to come on stream. But does this Texan prison have the answers? The challenge for ministers and the criminal justice system is how to stop the revolving doors on the UK's prisons - the reoffending and lack of prospects facing those who are released which draws them back into crime.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyderx4v8go,US measles outbreak kills child for first time in a decade,2025-02-27T20:46:25.522Z,,"A rapidly spreading outbreak of measles in Texas has killed one person, health officials said on Wednesday. It marks the first mortality from measles in the US in nearly a decade. The victim was an unvaccinated child who died in a Texas hospital after testing positive for measles, according to the state's health department. The Texas Department of State Health Services reported on Tuesday that it was aware of 124 cases diagnosed since the outbreak began last month, up from 90 on Friday. Almost all cases - 101 - were in patients 17 and younger. Speaking at the first cabinet meeting of US President Donald Trump's current term on Wednesday, Health Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr claimed that there had been two deaths. However, Katherine Wells, the director of the public health department in Lubbock, Texas, where the death occurred, clarified later that there has only been one. The US Department of Health and Human Services did not respond to a request for comment from the BBC clarifying the number of deaths. The US declared that measles had been ""eliminated"" in 2000, but the country has seen outbreaks in recent years amid a rise in anti-vaccine sentiment. The last US measles death was in 2015, according to the Infectious Diseases Society of America. The current outbreak is centred in north-west Texas, with measles also recently found across the state's border in New Mexico, as well as Alaska, California, Georgia, New Jersey, New York City and Rhode Island, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC). Currently, there are nine cases reported in New Mexico, four of whom are children. Kennedy, a vaccine sceptic in the past, said that measles outbreaks were common and there have been four measles outbreaks so far in the US this year. The CDC defines an outbreak as three or more related cases. He also said his department was monitoring the current outbreak closely. A measles infection can have particularly devastating complications for pregnant women and young children, including pneumonia, neurological impairment, hearing loss and death. Survivors are at risk of developing a degenerative brain and nervous system disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). There were 285 cases of measles reported in the US for all of last year, the highest number since 1,274 in 2019. So far, 18 people in the current outbreak have had to go to hospital, according to the Texas health department. Kennedy said altogether 20 people were in hospital to quarantine. Five people in Texas who were infected had been vaccinated, the department also said. New Mexico's congressional delegation pushed Kennedy to urgently address the current outbreak, urging him to ""launch a vaccination promotion campaign"" and rehire recently fired federal health workers, among other measures, in a letter on Monday. ""Just last Friday, two dozen employees at the CDC charged with training public laboratory staffers and supporting outbreak response efforts were fired,"" the state's two senators and three House members, all Democrats, wrote. ""Those firings will worsen outbreaks and ultimately threaten the health of all Americans in the face of the next public health emergency."" Meanwhile, areas affected by the outbreak are hosting free vaccination clinics, with the city of Lubbock, where the child victim died, holding hours-long clinics each day this week. The Texas outbreak is believed to have started in a rural Mennonite community with low vaccination rates, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, and local media. Most US children receive two immunisation shots to protect against the illness, which together are 97% effective in protecting against measles, according to the CDC. Vaccination rates in Texas are 94.3%, according to the CDC, which is below the 95% level that the Infectious Diseases Society of America says is needed to also protect those who are not immunized, commonly called ""herd immunity"". ""Measles was rare in the United States, but outbreaks are occurring in areas where vaccination rates have fallen,"" the American Academy of Pediatrics said in a statement. ""Most children who get measles are not up to date on recommended vaccines or are not old enough to get measles vaccine."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gg4x4w14o,Katy Perry to head to space on Blue Origin all-women flight,2025-02-27T19:36:34.341Z,Ali Abbas Ahmadi,"Pop star Katy Perry will blast off into space as part of an upcoming all-women flight on Blue Origin's New Shepard rocket. The Firework singer will be joined by Blue Origin owner Jeff Bezos's fiancee Lauren Sanchez, CBS presenter Gayle King, former Nasa rocket scientist Aisha Bowe, civil rights activist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerianne Flynn. Blue Origin said this is the first all-women space flight to take place since the Soviet Union's Valentina Tereshkova's solo mission in 1963. There is no specific date for the launch, but Blue Origin said it would take place this spring. Katy Perry is scheduled to be on her Lifetimes Tour from 23 April until 11 November, so this trip is expected to take place before that. ""If you had told me I'd be part of the first all-female crew in space, I would have believed you. Nothing was beyond my imagination as a child,"" Perry said in a statement cited by Newsweek. The NS-31 mission will be the 11th human spaceflight for the New Shepard rocket and the 31st in its history. So far, the programme has launched 52 people into space. A trip on the New Shepard typically lasts about 11 minutes, according to Blue Origin. It is fully autonomous - which means there are no pilots - and takes the passengers past the Karman line, internationally recognised as the edge of space. Blue Origin credited Lauren Sanchez for bringing the mission together, saying in its press release that she is ""honored to lead a team of explorers on a mission that will challenge their perspectives of Earth, empower them to share their own stories, and create lasting impact that will inspire generations to come"". Sanchez first announced her plan to fly with an all-women crew on a Blue Origin rocket in 2023 in an interview with Vogue, saying they were ""paving the way for women"". This is the latest group of celebrities to embark on a flight to space. Bezos himself flew on the company's first manned mission in 2021. Good Morning America's co-host Michael Strahan and Star Trek actor William Shatner have also been blasted into space on one of Bezos's rockets. Richard Branson, the founder of Virgin Galactic, made a trip aboard his company's VSS Unity spacecraft in July 2021. SpaceX founder Elon Musk, however, is yet to make a trip."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq6yy9e368vo,Trump administration unveils bird flu plan as egg prices soar,2025-02-27T15:01:32.739Z,Brandon Drenon,"The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) has announced a $1bn (£792m) plan to help US farmers combat a raging bird flu epidemic that has required them to kill millions of chickens and pushed the cost of eggs to an all-time high. Officials said they will budget $500m for biosecurity measures, roughly $100m for vaccine research and development, and $400m for farmer financial relief programs. More than 35 million birds have been killed in response to bird flu outbreaks in commercial flocks this year, according to USDA data. The bird culling has caused the average price for a dozen eggs in the US to hit $5 in January, a 53% increase from 2024 - and the USDA said prices could rise an additional 41%. The Trump administration said it will provide commercial egg farms with best practices and consulting services for free, and pay up to 75% of the costs to address vulnerabilities to help prevent the spread of bird flu. To address the threat of an egg shortage for US consumers, the government said it was willing to consider temporarily importing eggs that meet US safety standards. The USDA also said it will eliminate regulations that they say raise the cost of eggs. The policy changes are not expected to have an immediate effect on egg prices, USDA secretary Brooke Rollins told the BBC's media partner CBS News. ""This is more of a long-term solution, but what I can say is that those prices should start coming down maybe this spring, this summer as we work to implement some of those bigger-picture solutions,"" Rollins said. Soaring egg prices in the US have had some surprising knock-on effects. In New York City, where a dozen eggs can fetch $14, some stores have reportedly started successfully selling single eggs - called ""loosies"" - to those unwilling to shell out for a full dozen. In February, thieves in Pennsylvania stole over 100,000 eggs worth $40,000 from the back of a lorry."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgwwp2gd3jo,"Trump foreign aid freeze to stay for now, US Supreme Court chief rules",2025-02-27T11:19:39.938Z,Paulin Kola,"The top judge in the United States has given temporary backing to the Trump administration's freeze on foreign aid payments. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts' intervention came as the administration faced a midnight deadline (05:00 GMT on Thursday) to pay contractors. Officials had argued that they could not process the payments within the timeframe set by a lower court judge. Since coming to power in January, US President Donald Trump has taken quick action to end many aid programmes, largely run by the US Agency for International Development, USAID, and placed most of its staff on administrative leave or sacked them. The Trump administration is seeking to shrink the federal workforce and cut costs in a drive led by Elon Musk. The billionaire Trump adviser asked millions of bureaucrats over the weekend to list their accomplishments from the past week - sparking fury amongst the workforce and disagreement with officials leading the departments. US District Judge Amir Ali had ordered the US State Department and USAID to pay about $2bn-worth of bills (£1.6bn) to contractors by midnight on Wednesday. It is one of many interventions by judges trying to stop or pause a wave of Trump administration orders. As the deadline approached, the Trump administration went to the Supreme Court, arguing it was impossible to process claims in an orderly fashion in such a short period of time. The US federal government freeze comes as the administration carries out a review of foreign aid funding. Acting Solicitor General Sarah Harris said Judge Ali's order ""has thrown what should be an orderly review by the government into chaos"". The cutbacks to USAID have already upended the global aid system. Hundreds of programmes have been frozen in countries around the world since the president announced his intentions in January. The US is by far the biggest single provider of humanitarian aid around the world. It has bases in more than 60 countries and works in dozens of others, with much of its work carried out by its contractors. According to the Associated Press news agency, the Trump administration wants to eliminate more than 90% of the USAID's foreign aid contracts - and $60bn of US overseas aid."

Police in Manhattan said they responded to an emergency call on Wednesday morning and found Trachtenberg ""unconscious and unresponsive"". She was pronounced dead at the scene. The US actress was best known for playing Buffy the Vampire Slayer's younger sister Dawn Summers, and later took on the role of manipulative socialite Georgina Sparks in Gossip Girl as an adult. Trachtenberg made her film debut in Harriet the Spy in 1996, and also appeared in several Nickelodeon productions. Co-stars paid tribute to her, describing her as a ""fiercely intelligent"" person who ""cared deeply"" about her work. Her family's representatives confirmed her death in a statement. ""It is with great sadness to confirm that Michelle Trachtenberg has passed away. The family requests privacy for their loss,"" it said. Authorities said her death was not being treated as suspicious. ""Criminality is not suspected. The medical examiner will determine the cause of death. The investigation remains ongoing,"" the NYPD said in a statement. Trachtenberg got her start in acting at age nine on the Nickelodeon television series The Adventures of Pete & Pete. In the early 2000s, she was nominated for several acting awards - including a Daytime Emmy Award - for her role in Buffy the Vampire Slayer. She also starred in films including EuroTrip, Ice Princess, Killing Kennedy, and Sister Cities. Blake Lively, a Gossip Girl co-star, said everything Trachtenberg did ""she did 200%"". ""She laughed the fullest at someone's joke... she cared deeply about her work, she was fiercely loyal to her friends and brave for those she loved, she was big and bold and distinctly herself,"" she wrote on social media. ""The real tragedies in life are the ones that blindside you on an idle Tuesday. Hold those you love and have loved dear."" US comedian Rosie O'Donnell, who starred alongside Trachtenberg in her Harriet the Spy debut, said her death was ""heartbreaking"". ""I loved her very much. She struggled the last few years. I wish I could have helped."" Josh Safran, a writer and producer on Gossip Girl, said it was ""an honour and joy to write for Michelle for so many years"", as she had a ""clear voice"" as an actor. ""You heard her as you typed,"" he wrote. ""You knew she'd make each line rougher, more real, much funnier - and that made the writing better. Former castmates also paid tribute. Buffy cast member James Marsters said on social media that the actress was ""fiercely intelligent, howlingly funny, and a very talented person"". ""She died much too young, and leaves behind scores of people who knew and loved her,"" Marsters said. How I Met Your Mother actress Alyson Hannigan, who played Willow Rosenberg in Buffy, shared a series of photos on social media, including images of the two sharing scenes, and said Trachtenberg ""brought a loving energy to the set of Buffy"". Trachtenberg first appeared in Gossip Girl - which ran from 2007 to 2012 - in 2008. She returned to the role for two episodes of the second season of HBO Max's reboot in 2023. Her last major acting role was in 2021 as the host of a true-crime docuseries Meet, Marry, Murder, which appeared on digital streamer Tubi. In 2021, Trachtenberg accused Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon of inappropriate behaviour on set, after her co-star Charisma Carpenter said she had been left traumatised due to the treatment she received from Whedon."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c170l0n8j54o,Three possible paths to freedom: What's next for the Menendez brothers?,2025-02-27T09:07:33.049Z,Sam Granville and Christal Hayes,"After 35 years behind bars, Lyle and Erik Menendez are closer than ever to a potential second chance at freedom. The brothers, who were convicted of killing their parents, José and Kitty Menendez, in 1989, have long maintained that the murders in their Beverly Hills mansion were driven by years of sexual and physical abuse, rather than hopes of inheriting their fortune. They are currently serving life in prison without the possibility of parole in California. A mix of new evidence and public interest has thrown the case, one that has both gripped and divided the nation for decades, upside down. It's all reached a pivotal moment. A resentencing hearing is set in March, which could lead to their sentences being reduced - or even their freedom. Separately, California Gov Gavin Newsom has ordered the state's parole board to conduct a risk assessment, a key step toward possible clemency, which could take form in a reduced sentence or a pardon. The movement in the historic criminal case is significant, but not everyone is happy at the prospect of them potentially walking free. There are three possible routes the brothers have been trekking in hopes of gaining their freedom. 1. Clemency from the Governor of California Clemency could mean a reduced sentence or even a pardon, but it would not overturn the brother's convictions. California Gov. Gavin Newsom has ordered the parole board to conduct a risk assessment to determine if the brothers pose a danger to society. Depending on the results, the governor could grant clemency, commuting their sentences to make them eligible for parole or even releasing them outright. The probe will examine the factors behind their crimes and their rehabilitation while in prison. It marks the first step in a broader process that could lead to clemency. 2. A new trial The brothers' defence attorneys have also asked for a new trial. They pointed to new evidence about the alleged sexual abuse by their father and argued jurors should be able to consider a lesser sentence, such as manslaughter. But newly elected Los Angeles County District Attorney Nathan Hochman said his office will oppose the request. 3. Resentencing The last avenue is likely the most significant. The brothers are being vetted for resentencing, a legal process that could reduce their life sentences and grant them eligibility for parole. A hearing is scheduled for 20 March and 21 March to discuss this possibility. This effort centres on whether the brothers have rehabilitated after 35 years in prison and whether recent changes in California law apply to their case. In October 2024, then-LA County District Attorney George Gascón recommended resentencing for the brothers, citing California's evolving approach to juvenile offenders and abuse survivors. Shortly after the announcement, he lost a re-election campaign. The decision now rests with current DA Nathan Hochman, who was elected in November, and is examining the case before making a decision on whether to back the effort in court. One key argument for resentencing stems from a change in California law that allows offenders who were under the age of 26 at the time of their crime to be sentenced as minors rather than adults. Since Lyle was 21 and Erik was 18 when they killed their parents, their defence attorneys argue that this law should apply to them. If they had been sentenced under today's legal framework, they might have received lighter sentences or had the possibility of parole from the beginning, their attorneys argue. Neama Rahmani, a criminal defence attorney and former federal prosecutor, told the BBC that a ""perfect storm of PR and politics"" has led to the Menendez brothers having a real shot at freedom. He noted the recent attention the case has gotten from celebrities, a Netflix drama and docuseries on the case, and an ""embattled"" district attorney who was vying to remain in office. ""You're never going to see another case like this. It's a unicorn."" The Menendez brothers filed a motion in May 2023 detailing new evidence in their case they claim shows they were victims of childhood sexual abuse by their father, Jose Menendez, and requested their convictions be vacated. This includes an allegation of rape from a former member of Menudo, Roy Rosselló, and a letter Erik Menendez wrote to a cousin eight months before the murders, which detailed the alleged abuse. Gascón, who was the top prosecutor in LA at the time, announced just 12 days before a tough re-election in November 2024 that he would back the resentencing request. He has denied the announcement was political and argued it was a long-time coming. Gascón lost his re-election bid and was replaced by voters with the more moderate Hochman, whose view of the case remains unclear. The decision also came amid renewed attention in the case spurred by a new Netflix drama, Monsters: The Lyle and Erik Menendez Story as well as the release of docudrama, The Menendez Brothers. The series introduced the case to a new generation and garnered attention from celebrities - including Kim Kardashian and Rosie O'Donnell - who called for the brothers to be released. More than two dozen members of the Menendez family have issued public pleas for Erik and Lyle to be released. Those family members alleged the boys endured horrific sexual abuse at the hands of their father and are not a threat to society. Kitty Menendez's sister, Joan Anderson VanderMolen, argued “the whole world wasn’t ready to believe that the boys could be raped, or that young men could be victims of sexual violence"". She said that now “we know better"" and ""a jury today would never deliver such a harsh sentence"". But the family isn't in total agreement. A lawyer for Kitty Menendez’s brother, Milton Andersen, has called the brothers ""cold-blooded"" and said their ""actions shattered their family and left a trail of grief that has persisted for decades."" ""Jose was shot six times, and Kitty was shot ten times, including a shot to her face after Erik reloaded."" Mr Andersen believes his nephews should stay in prison for their ""heinous act"", according to his lawyer, Kathy Cady. Motive has long been at the heart of this case. During their trials, prosecutors painted the brothers as spoiled rich kids who killed their wealthy parents in their Beverly Hills mansion so they could access a $14m (£10.7m) fortune. They argued the duo methodically bought shotguns and fatally shot their parents a total of 13 times as the couple watched TV. They then went gambling, to parties and on shopping sprees, buying things like Rolex watches. It was ultimately a confession to a psychologist that helped lead to their arrest when the girlfriend of their doctor reported it to authorities. The brothers ultimately admitted to the killings - but argued they acted out of self-defence after years of emotional, physical and sexual abuse. They told the court they feared their parents would kill them if they didn’t act first. Lyle and Erik testified they confronted their parents about the sexual abuse and things had become combative in their household and they believed their parents were planning to kill them. Family members testified about the abuse they witnessed - but none said they saw sexual abuse first-hand. Both brothers married while serving life sentences without the possibility of parole. Lyle Menendez has been married twice. In 1996, he wed Anna Eriksson, a former model, after they developed a relationship through letters. Their marriage ended in divorce in 2001. Two years later, in 2003, he married Rebecca Sneed, a magazine editor. Sneed has remained out of the public eye but has maintained her commitment despite the challenges of prison life. Erik Menendez also found love behind bars. In 1999, he married Tammi Saccoman after a pen-pal romance developed into a deeper connection. In 2005, she published a memoir, They Said We'd Never Make It, chronicling their unconventional marriage and the difficulties of loving someone serving a life sentence. She has described their relationship as ""fulfilling and deeply emotional,"" despite never being able to share a traditional life together. Court records also detail more about their lives behind bars. A motion filed in support of their resentencing bid details they both received educational degrees. It also details various programmes they launched behind bars that aimed to help other inmates, including those who were victims of childhood trauma and disabled or elderly inmates. All of this was done, the report notes, ""without any expectation or hope of ever being released""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y44gw5gpro,Bezos focuses Washington Post opinion section on free markets and liberties,2025-02-27T03:25:46.204Z,Nadine Yousif and Madeline Halpert,"Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos has announced that the newspaper's opinion section will focus on supporting “personal liberties and free markets"", and pieces opposing those views will not be published. The move, which marks a major shift away from the section's broad opinion coverage, prompted the outlet's opinion editor David Shipley to resign. Bezos, the billionaire founder of Amazon, sent a memo to staff on Wednesday which he also posted to X. “We are going to be writing every day in support and defence of two pillars: personal liberties and free markets,“ Bezos said. He added the opinion section would cover other topics, but “viewpoints opposing those pillars will be left to be published by others”. “There was a time when a newspaper, especially one that was a local monopoly, might have seen it as a service to bring to the reader's doorstep every morning a broad-based opinion section that sought to cover all views,” Bezos wrote. “Today, the internet does that job.” Bezos added that he had asked Mr Shipley if he wanted to stay at the outlet after the changes, but he said no. ""This is a significant shift, it won't be easy, and it will require 100% commitment - I respect his decision,"" Bezos said. The billionaire businessman's move is a significant intervention in the editorial side of the newspaper, which he acquired in 2013. It follows a decision last year not to run an endorsement of Democratic presidential candidate Kamala Harris, and to stop making presidential endorsements in general, which led to resignations and the loss of thousands of subscribers. According to the Washington Post, Will Lewis, the outlet’s chief executive, said in a memo to staff that the changes to the opinion section were ""not about siding with any political party”. ""This is about being crystal clear about what we stand for as a newspaper,"" he said. The decision was praised by several of President Donald Trump‘s allies, including billionaire Elon Musk, who wrote on social media: “Bravo, @JeffBezos!"" But on a Washington Post article announcing the change, some subscribers wrote in the comment section criticising the decision, and others said they would be cancelling their subscription."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yxvywr015o,US Supreme Court hears arguments in 'straight discrimination' case,2025-02-26T22:05:04.164Z,Mike Wendling,"US Supreme Court justices indicated during a hearing on Wednesday that they would side with a woman who alleged she was discriminated against at her job because she is heterosexual. Marlean Ames worked for the Ohio Department of Youth Services for more than 20 years. She claims she was passed over for a promotion, then demoted, because she is straight. The job she hoped to get and the one she held when demoted, were both given to gay colleagues, according to the lawsuit. Ohio state officials have denied the discrimination, and Ms Ames has so far been unsuccessful in court. In oral arguments in front of the Supreme Court - split 6-3 in favour of conservative judges - justices on both sides ideologically appeared sympathetic to Ms Ames's case. A 1964 US law forbids discrimination in the workplace, and in 2020, the Supreme Court ruled that protection extends to sexual orientation, however lower courts have dismissed Ms Ames's case. US court precedent covering some states, including Ohio, requires that members of majority groups - such as white people or heterosexuals - show a higher level of evidence when making discrimination claims. Plaintiffs in those cases – sometimes called ""reverse discrimination"" – are required to show additional ""background circumstances"" to prove their case, for instance evidence that LGBTQ people made decisions affecting the person discriminated against, or evidence showing a pattern of discrimination. According to the lawsuit, Ms Ames had positive performance evaluations, but in 2019 she and two other heterosexual employees were passed over for a promotion that was eventually given to a lesbian. She was later demoted, according to the lawsuit, and her job was given to a gay man. In addition to ruling that Ms Ames did not show a pattern of discrimination or ""background circumstances"", a lower court also previously found that managers at the youth services department had ""legitimate, nondiscriminatory business reasons"" for their decisions. During arguments on Wednesday, Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, one of the court's conservative members, said: ""Discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, whether you are gay or straight, is prohibited. The rules are the same whichever way it goes."" According to the transcript of the hearing, another conservative justice, Amy Coney Barrett, said that ""it doesn't matter if she was gay or whether she was straight"", the legal burden should be the same. And several of the court's liberal justices seemed to agree. Neil Gorsuch indicated that he thought allowing Ms Ames' lawsuit to proceed would be a ""wise course"". While talking about the facts of the case, Justice Sonia Sotomayor said ""something's suspicious"" which ""certainly can give rise to an inference of discrimination."" Ohio officials were represented in court by the state Solicitor General T Elliot Gaiser, a former lawyer for Trump. Gaiser told the justices ""everyone here agrees that everyone should be treated equally"", but argued that the officials who made the job decisions did not know Ames' sexual orientation and thus could not have used it to discriminate against her. Lawyers for the state also argue that those making the employment decisions were heterosexual and had legitimate concerns about Ms Ames's vision for the youth services department. The Supreme Court could order lower courts to re-examine the case and allow the lawsuit to go ahead."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq5zgvdz2z0o,Trump says $5m 'gold card' immigration visas will 'sell like crazy',2025-02-26T20:13:24.874Z,Madeline Halpert,"President Donald Trump has unveiled plans for selling a ""gold card"" visa for $5m (£3.9m) that will offer wealthy buyers permanent residency in the US and a path to citizenship. At the first cabinet meeting of his current term, Trump told reporters that the visas would function similarly to green cards, which allow immigrants of varying incomes to live and work permanently in the US, but would go to ""high-level people"". ""The people that can pay $5m, they're going to create jobs,"" Trump said. ""It's going to sell like crazy. It's a bargain."" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, also at the meeting, said the gold visas would replace the current visa programme for foreign investors, but offered few details. Dozens of countries around the world offer some sort of citizenship by investment programme, including several in Europe, like Portugal, which gives ""golden visas"", or permanent residency for foreigners who invest €500,000 ($524,000) into a qualifying fund. Trump said companies would use the golden visa programme to hire non-citizens to work for them in the US. ""We have to be able to get people in the country, and we want people that are productive people,"" Trump said. Typically, green card holders in the US can apply for citizenship after five years. Trump suggested revenue from the high-priced visas could be used to pay off US debt. Lutnick said that the initiative will replace the EB-5 visa, which gives permanent residency to some foreigners who invest around $1m and create at least 10 full-time jobs in the US. Saying the EB-5 programme was ""poorly overseen and poorly executed"", Lutnick said the golden visas would be an improvement. ""We're going to make sure they're wonderful world-class global citizens,"" Lutnick said of future gold card applicants. It was not immediately clear how the government would select recipients, if there were exclusions, or if there would be any cap on how many are issued. During the fiscal year of 2024, the State Department issued over 12,000 EB-5 visas, a record high for the programme."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn48z5q28vyo,US congresswoman votes with baby in arms after proxy vote ban,2025-02-26T20:06:03.760Z,Ana Faguy,"Four weeks after giving birth to her second child, Congresswoman Brittany Pettersen cradled her baby son in her arms as she cast a crucial vote on the House floor. Unable to vote remotely due to congressional rules, the Colorado Democrat flew across the country to oppose a multi-trillion-dollar budget deal, which narrowly passed in the House of Representatives. ""Unfortunately, I wasn't given the opportunity to vote remotely after giving birth, but I wasn't going to let that stop me from representing my constituents,"" Pettersen said on Tuesday. The congresswoman - the 14th lawmaker to give birth while in office - now leads a bipartisan push for more flexibility for members with growing families. In January, she introduced legislation allowing proxy voting for up to 12 weeks for members who have ""given birth or whose spouse have given birth and pregnant members who are unable to travel safely or have a serious medical condition"". The bill has 137 bipartisan co-sponsors. Proxy voting - where a lawmaker designates another to vote on their behalf - was temporarily allowed during the pandemic, but current House rules prohibit it. The restriction allowed some to see the unintended benefits of proxy voting for those recovering from childbirth or illness, but critics argued the policy was being abused. More than 100 Republican members of the House of Representatives, including current Speaker Mike Johnson, filed lawsuit to end the practice, arguing it was unconstitutional. The legal argument failed, but when Republicans regained control of the House in 2023, former Speaker of the House Kevin McCarthy ended proxy voting. Pettersen and another Republican congresswoman who gave birth in 2023 continue to push for flexibility for new parents on Capitol Hill. Congresswoman Anna Paulina Luna, a Florida Republican who gave birth in 2023, missed 137 votes in the weeks after she gave birth. Doctors had advised her not to travel while recovering from a difficult birth. Luna called the inability to proxy vote a ""slap in the face to every constituent"" who elected her. ""How is it not discriminatory to tell a duly elected member of Congress that she can't vote because she gave birth to a child?"" she said in a video statement last month. ""New mothers in Congress should not be forced to choose their careers over children or choose children over careers."" But Republican leadership has yet to budge. ""I have great sympathy, empathy for all of our young women legislators who are of birthing age. It's a real quandary,"" Johnson said in a statement last month. ""But I'm afraid it doesn't fit with the language of the Constitution, and that's the inescapable truth that we have."" Jean Sinzdak, associate director at the Center for American Women and Politics, said the pushback, in part, is cultural: many of the leaders of institutions like congress are older men who are not concerned about the trials of young parents and families. ""It doesn't behove the leaders of these institutions to change this process because it's not affecting them directly,"" Ms Sinzdak told the BBC. The UK parliament now allows proxy voting for members of parliament who are new parents, experiencing childbirth complications or need fertility treatment. The European parliament currently has no provisions to allow heavily pregnant members to vote if they can't physically make it to Strasbourg, the formal seat of the office. Pettersen and Luna are now trying to bypass Johnson and put the legislation to a floor vote - it is a tough road but it may be their best shot unless the thinking surrounding proxy voting changes."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2lj0vrkv9yo,Five takeaways from Canada's Liberal leadership debates,2025-02-26T03:54:06.108Z,Nadine Yousif,"After back-to-back debates in both English and French, the candidates to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party in Canada have made their case to voters. Card-holding Liberals will now choose between former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former finance minister Chrystia Freeland, House government leader Karina Gould and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis. Whoever wins the vote on 9 March will become Canada's next prime minister and will lead the Liberals in the forthcoming general election, which must be held on or before 20 October of this year. A big focus of the debates has been how Canada should respond to US President Donald Trump, who has threatened steep tariffs on America's northern neighbour and has suggested that Canada become the ""51st state."" Here are five big takeaways from the two Liberal leadership debates. How Canada should respond to what many have dubbed an ""existential threat"" from US President Donald Trump has unsurprisingly dominated the agenda at both debates. Trump has said he plans to impose a 25% tariff on all Canadian exports, with the exception of energy that would be tariffed at a lower 10% - a move that economists say would be devastating for Canada while increasing prices for Americans. He has also repeatedly proposed that the US should annex Canada, which has been met with alarm and anger from large swathes of the Canadian population. Freeland, a former top minister who served during Trump's first term, positioned herself as an experienced negotiator who has fought - and won - against the US president and his previous tariffs. But Carney warned that the Trump of today was not the Trump of the past. ""He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,"" Carney said. ""In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country."" Gould, the youngest candidate, suggested that Canada should ""put everything on the table"" to protect its sovereignty, and that the federal government should help businesses diversify their portfolios to depend less on the US. Baylis, meanwhile, said Canada needed to forge closer economic ties with the UK, New Zealand and Australia, saying all four were like-minded countries with shared values, culture, and government systems. Trump's threats are made more alarming by Canada's current economic situation. Canadians have voiced frustrations over the stubborn high cost of living. Carney - an economist by trade - promised a plan that would balance Canada's operational budget in three years and proposed that Canada rethink the way it spends its money. But he has also noted his support for key Liberal programmes, like affordable childcare and dental care. As the former finance minister, Freeland defended her track record, saying the country's finances were still ""very strong"". She added that Canada should capitalise on the surge of patriotism in the face of Trump's threats, using that momentum to support Canadian industries and promote job growth. Baylis drew on his expertise as a businessman to say that Canada should work on building its productivity. Gould, on the other hand, said the Liberal Party should be ""realistic with Canadians"" and that balancing the budget in three years was not possible without significant cuts, which she did not support. She said Canada should instead focus on ""modernising its social safety net"" to help those who are struggling. ""We are facing extreme threats from the US, so we have to be able to invest in our people and in our businesses to protect them,"" Gould said. The four candidates were debating with each other but they often presented a united front against their shared opponent, Conservative party leader Pierre Poilievre, whose party is favoured in the polls as the most likely to form Canada's next government. Liberal leadership hopefuls threw several jabs at Poilievre throughout the debate. Gould called him ""our little version of Trump here at home"" while Freeland said Poilievre was looking to ""imitate"" Trump. Carney criticised Poilievre as ""irresponsible"" and added that Canada could ""not afford"" to have him as prime minister. Poilievre, who has enjoyed a sizable lead in the polls ahead of an unpopular Trudeau, has had to pivot his pitch to Canadians since Trudeau's resignation. His message changed from criticising the sitting prime minister for leading a ""broken"" Canada to putting ""Canada First"" in the face of threats from the US. He has also shifted his focus to attacking Carney, who is favoured to win the Liberal leadership race. Poilievre is still polling ahead nationally, but some polls suggest that the lead between him and the Liberals has shrunk since Trudeau's exit. Responding to shifting US policy on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war, all four candidates affirmed their commitment to continuing Canada's support for Ukraine. All of them also backed the need for Canada to hit its 2% military spending target as set out in its commitments to the Nato alliance, though they disagreed on the timeline and how to get there. Freeland said Canada should hit the target by 2027, and should do so by investing in the ""next generation of warfare"". Baylis and Carney have said their plan would be for Canada to reach that target by 2030. Both Freeland and Carney said Canada needed to invest that money into Canadian military ventures instead of into the US. Freeland noted that Canada should reduce its reliance on the US, and should look to work with the EU and other Nato partners on security assurances. A tax on carbon for consumers and businesses has been the cornerstone of the Trudeau government's policy on climate change. But that tax has proven to be unpopular with Canadians, forcing Carney and Freeland to promise that they would ditch the policy. Carney, a former UN special envoy on climate action and finance, has long been a proponent of the carbon tax. In the debates, however, he acknowledged the tax on consumers had become divisive, and said he would instead focus on taxing big polluters and growing clean energy projects in Canada. Freeland, who resigned from Trudeau's government because of disagreements with the prime minister on spending, said that history would judge his climate action favourably despite his policies' unpopularity. But she, too, vowed to scrap the carbon tax. ""Democracy is about listening to people, and Canadians were very clear with us that they did not think that policy worked for them,"" she said. Gould and Baylis, on the other hand, said they would keep some version of the consumer tax on carbon in place, saying that fighting climate change comes with a price."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2rmxr90eyo,Trump to invite Philadelphia Eagles to White House after Super Bowl win,2025-02-26T03:20:25.324Z,Ali Abbas Ahmadi,"President Donald Trump has said he will invite the Philadelphia Eagles to the White House to celebrate their recent Super Bowl win, despite rumours that the champions may decline the invitation. ""Absolutely, they'll be extended an invitation,"" Trump said in the Oval Office on Tuesday. ""They deserve to be down here, and we hope to see them."" The Eagles skipped a visit to the White House when they won in 2018, but the team plans to attend the event this year, US media report. Rumours of the Eagles declining an invitation to the White House created a firestorm on social media after a weeks-old report from The US Sun resurfaced online. The Eagles defeated the Kansas City Chiefs 40-22 earlier this month, securing the team's second Super Bowl. Sports teams visiting the White House after winning a championship is a tradition that dates back to the 19th Century, but in the past decades some have used it to make a statement. Only one of the four teams that won the Super Bowl during Trump's first term in office made a trip to the White House. That was the New England Patriots in 2017. The Philadelphia Eagles did not go to the White House after their victory in 2018. The president said at the time that the players disagreed with his view ""that they proudly stand for the national anthem"", although the team or players never confirmed that as the reason. Instead, Trump invited a group of Eagles fans to a ""celebration of the American flag"". In 2017, NBA champions the Golden State Warriors were uninvited from the White House event by Trump after star player Stephen Curry said he did not want to go. The Warriors were not invited when they won the NBA Championship again in 2018. There were, however, some memorable sporting visits to the White House under Trump. He famously welcomed Clemson University's football team in 2018 with burgers from McDonald's, Wendy's and other fast food restaurants. Louis Moore, a professor of history at Grand Valley State University, told the BBC that these celebratory visits to the White House are political, even if they do not initially seem that way. ""For some guys [going to the White House] is a lifelong dream,"" he said. ""But in basketball and football and women's soccer, it's definitely political. The idea not to go is political, and even the idea to go is political."" He added that the event has become even more political since Trump's first election victory in 2016. ""Early on in Trump's presidency, teams weren't going to the White House. Before that, there were no announcements,"" he said. ""But now you see people announcing that they're not going."" Mr Moore said that every presidential candidate since the 1930s has sought an athlete's endorsement. ""Presidents want to be around winners, and winners want to be around the president,"" he said. Trump is not the only president who has been snubbed by sports teams and players. NBA legend Larry Bird declined to visit Ronald Reagan in the White House after becoming an NBA champion with the Boston Celtics in 1984. ""If the president wants to see me, he knows where to find me,"" he said. In 2013, Matt Birk of the Baltimore Ravens declined to visit the White House celebration because he opposed Barack Obama's stance on abortion. According to CBS Sports, Birk complained of an Obama speech where the president had said ""God bless Planned Parenthood""."

The petition, which opened to signatures five days ago, accuses Mr Musk of acting against Canada's national interest and undermining its sovereignty. In Canada, citizenship can be revoked only if someone has committed fraud, misrepresented themselves or knowingly hid information on an immigration or citizenship application. Mr Musk, who was born in South Africa, holds both Canadian and US citizenship. Responding to the petition, the billionaire wrote on X: ""Canada is not a real country."" The post was later deleted. The petition claims the billionaire ""has used his wealth and power to influence our elections"" and ""has now become a member of a foreign government that is attempting to erase Canadian sovereignty"". Mr Musk has Canadian citizenship through his mother, who was born in Saskatchewan. Launched on 20 February, the petition, already signed by more than 250,000 Canadians, remains open for signatures until 20 June. It is mostly symbolic and has no legal force. But petitions with at least 500 signatures and a member of parliament's backing typically receive a government response, this one may not, as a spring election could dissolve parliament. It was created by a British Columbia author and endorsed by MP Charlie Angus of the New Democratic Party. Angus, a 20-year MP for Timmins–James Bay, has announced he will not seek re-election. The BBC has contacted his office for comment. US-Canada tensions have escalated since Trump's return, with the president repeatedly suggesting Canada could become a US state and threatening tariffs on steel, aluminium, and other imports. Canadian leaders have pushed back, vowing counter-tariffs. The spat has spilled out beyond government, with Canadians cancelling US trips, boycotting American products, and booing opposing anthems at hockey and basketball games. Mr Musk moved to Canada from South Africa at 18, and worked odd jobs before studying at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. He later emigrated to the US. The billionaire has backed Trump's hardline immigration policies but now faces scrutiny over claims he worked illegally in the US on a student visa. In a recent interview, Steve Bannon, a former advisor to President Trump, called Mr Musk a ""parasitic illegal immigrant"". The Tesla CEO has denied the accusations, and has said he did not work illegally. He became a naturalised US citizen in 2002, according to a recent biography. The BBC has contacted Mr Musk via his businesses for comment."

The 217-215 vote was seen as a key early test for Republican House speaker Mike Johnson, who cancelled an earlier vote as it appeared he did not have enough support. Several Republicans wanted more fiscal discipline from a budget that includes $4.5tn (£3.6tn) in tax cuts, funded partially by spending reductions but also by potentially increasing the US government's substantial debt pile. But the bill eventually passed along party lines, with all Democrats voting against and just one Republican opposed. That Republican was Thomas Massie of Kentucky, a prominent fiscal hawk who wanted deeper spending cuts. One Democrat did not vote. The House budget seeks $2tn in spending cuts over the next 10 years to pay for President Trump's agenda. It includes more than $100bn in new spending on immigration enforcement and the military. It also would extend tax breaks passed during his first term in office, which are due to expire at the end of the year. Trump has said that the public health program known as Medicaid wouldn't be affected, but achieving the drastic cuts Republicans seek could be difficult without cutting major social services. ""Social Security won't be touched, other than this fraud or something we're going to find,"" Trump said during a Fox News interview last week. ""It's going to be strengthened, but won't be touched. Medicare, Medicaid, none of that stuff is going to be touched."" Speaker Johnson has spent several days negotiating with more members of his party who are concerned about such cuts to social services. However, there are still a number of steps the spending plan must go through in order to become law. The budget will have to be merged with a separate one that is under consideration by the US Senate, in a process called reconciliation. And even if both chambers ultimately agree on a spending plan, many finer details will need to be negotiated before it can be sent to President Trump's desk to be signed. House Republican leaders initially delayed Tuesday's vote when it was unclear whether they would have enough support to pass the measure. Speaker Johnson and the second most senior House Republican, Steve Scalise, spent hours working to convince wavering party members to back the plan which, as well as tax cuts, would fund border security measures, deportations and military spending. Trump personally called some of the holdouts to encourage them to pass the bill, the two Republican leaders said. ""Trump helped us with a number of members,"" Scalise told reporters. ""Talking to anybody that we asked that really needed to clarify things."" Three of the four party holdouts who had been initially seen as firm no votes - Representatives Tim Burchett, Victoria Spartz and Warren Davidson - ultimately voted in favour. ""We have a lot of hard work ahead of us, but we are going to deliver the American First agenda,"" House Speaker Mike Johnson told reporters after the vote. ""We're going to celebrate tonight, and we'll roll up our sleeves and get right back in the morning."" Democrats lined up to criticise the budget as a tax cut mostly for the wealthy, which they said would hurt low-income families who rely on the government-funded health care programme Medicaid. The party worked to get as many members in the chamber for the crucial vote, with Representative Brittany Petterson arriving with her son while on maternity leave. The Senate will be under pressure to take up the House's spending framework because President Trump has endorsed it, despite their separate bill which was introduced last week."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce30n52e6p1o,White House takes control of press pool that covers Trump,2025-02-26T00:04:08.121Z,Bernd Debusmann Jr,"The White House plans to determine which news outlets have access to President Donald Trump, taking control from an association of journalists after more than a century. The changes, announced by Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt on Tuesday, mean the White House will determine which outlets participate in the ""pool"" that covers presidential events and shares material with other media outlets. The rotation of pool reporters was previously determined by the White House Correspondents' Association (WHCA), which said the decision ""tears at the independence of a free press"". The surprise announcement comes as the Associated Press fights to restore its access to presidential events after it was blocked. ""The White House press team in this administration will determine who gets to enjoy the very privileged and limited access in spaces such as Air Force One and the Oval Office,"" Leavitt said at a news briefing on Tuesday. She said the changes would allow ""new media"" outlets - including streaming services and podcasts - to ""share in this awesome responsibility"". ""Legacy media outlets who have been here for years will still participate in the pool, but new voices are going to be welcomed in as well,"" she said. ""[By] deciding which outlets make up the limited press pool on a day-to-day basis, the White House will be restoring power back to the American people,"" Leavitt added. Founded in 1914, the WHCA has historically handled some logistics around day-to-day coverage of the president, most notably the ""pool"" of reporters, which includes a camera crew from one of the five major US networks, a radio correspondent and a rotating group of print outlets. The WHCA has long claimed the pool is beneficial both for the president - who is able to quickly disseminate news - as well as for the wider media who receive pool reports, photographs, video and audio. Pool reporters are on-duty every day - including weekends and holidays - both at the White House or when the president is travelling. BBC News is among the outlets that participate in the radio pool. The WHCA expressed concern that the move will benefit the White House by giving access to news outlets that it sees as sympathetic or friendly. ""This move does not give power back to the people - it gives power to the White House,"" Fox News reporter Jacqui Heinrich, a WHCA board member, wrote on X. In its own statement, the WHCA said that the decision ""suggests the government will choose the journalists who cover the president"". The WHCA said it was not given any notice about the White House's decision before Tuesday's news briefing. Leavitt, meanwhile, said the WHCA would no longer have a ""monopoly"" on controlling the pool. President Trump was asked about the announcement in the Oval Office later on Tuesday. ""We're going to be calling those shots,"" he said of the changes. Earlier this week, a US judge declined a request by the Associated Press to immediately restore its access to presidential events after the Trump administration blocked the agency in a dispute over the term ""Gulf of America"". The news agency has refused to change its style from the Gulf of Mexico to the ""Gulf of America"", after President Trump renamed it with an executive order. The AP argues the ban is retaliatory and infringes on First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and the press. The ban has meant that the AP - which hundreds of news outlets rely on - has been unable to access press events alongside the rest of the pool at the White House as well as Air Force One. A hearing has been scheduled for 20 March."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx24gze60yzo,Who is on Trump's top team?,2025-02-25T22:50:01.477Z,,"The new team entrusted with delivering Donald Trump's agenda is in place, featuring several contentious picks. Ahead of his return to the White House on 20 January 2025, he appointed Fox News host and military veteran Pete Hegseth as defence secretary and vaccine sceptic Robert F Kennedy Jr as health secretary—both confirmed by the Senate. Marco Rubio is the secretary of state, while billionaire supporter Elon Musk is advising on mass layoffs, contract terminations, and a drastic federal government downsizing. Here's a closer look at his top officials: Secretary of state - Marco Rubio Florida Senator Rubio, 53, was confirmed as US secretary of state just hours after Trump was sworn into office. He is now serving as the top US diplomat when representing the country overseas, and also the president's main adviser on foreign affairs. Rubio, who is the first Latino person to hold the post in US history, takes a hawkish view of China. He opposed Trump in the 2016 Republican primary but has since mended fences. Defence secretary - Pete Hegseth Hegseth, a military veteran and Fox News host with no prior political experience, was confirmed as defence secretary less than a week after Trump's inauguration. His appointment was highly anticipated amid ongoing wars in Ukraine and Gaza. ""Nobody fights harder for the troops,"" Trump said of Hegseth. After Hegseth's nomination it emerged that he was investigated in 2017 for an alleged sexual assault. He was never arrested or charged and denies the allegation. His lawyer confirmed he paid a woman that year to stay silent about a separate assault claim he feared could cost him his Fox job—an accusation he also denies. Attorney general - Pam Bondi Trump's first pick for attorney general, former Florida Congressman Matt Gaetz, withdrew after a week of controversy over a congressional investigation into sexual misconduct and drug allegations against him, which he denied. Six hours later, Trump named former Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi as his replacement. ""Pam was a prosecutor for nearly 20 years, tough on violent criminals, and made Florida's streets safe,"" he wrote. Bondi previously served on Trump's Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission and was part of his defence team during his first impeachment trial. Department of the interior - Doug Burgum Burgum, the former governor of North Dakota, leads the Department of the Interior, which is responsible for the management and conservation of federal lands and natural resources. A software entrepreneur who sold his small company to Microsoft in 2001, Burgum briefly ran in the 2024 Republican primary before dropping out, endorsing Trump and quickly impressing him with his low-drama persona and sizeable wealth. Health and human services - Robert F Kennedy Jr RFK Jr, as he is known, is an environmental lawyer, vaccine sceptic and the nephew of former President John F Kennedy. He recently added leading the Department of Health and Human Services to his resume. Despite having no medical qualifications, Kennedy, 70, now has broad remit over US federal health agencies - including those that oversee approval of vaccines and pharmaceuticals. Kennedy has endorsed a number of health claims that are not backed by scientific evidence, including many on vaccines, which have concerned many medical experts. Food and Drug Administration - Dr Marty Makary Trump has nominated Makary to lead the Food and Drug Administration, the organisation responsible for the safety of prescription drugs and vaccines . Trump announced in his nomination that Dr Makary would be ideal to ""course-correct and refocus the Agency"". The Johns Hopkins University professor is an author, surgeon and trained cancer specialist. He spoke to conservative media outlets during the Covid-19 pandemic, questioning the need for masks and expressing concerns over the Covid vaccine among young children, which research showed helped prevent severe illness. Veterans' affairs - Doug Collins Former Georgia congressman Doug Collins leads the US Department of Veterans' Affairs. Collins was a Trump loyalist when he served in Congress from 2013-21 and an outspoken advocate for the president during both impeachment hearings. An Iraq war veteran who now serves as a chaplain in the US Air Force Reserve, Collins left Congress for an unsuccessful bid for the Senate in his home state of Georgia. Homeland security - Kristi Noem Former South Dakota Governor Noem is in a key role in the administration, overseeing US security, including its borders, cyber-threats, terrorism and emergency response. The agency has a $62bn (£48bn) budget and employs thousands of people. It incorporates a wide variety of agencies under its umbrella, ranging from Customs and Border Protection to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Transportation secretary - Sean Duffy The former congressman and Fox Business host leads the Department of Transportation. He is in charge of aviation, automotive, rail, transit and other transportation policies at a department with an annual budget of roughly $110bn. In the role, the secretary can expect to face a number of safety-related aviation issues, including a series of deadly plane crashes in the US in the early months of 2025. Energy secretary - Chris Wright Oil and gas industry executive Wright leads the Department of Energy, where he is expected to fulfil Trump's campaign promise to ""drill, baby, drill"" and maximise US energy production. Wright, the founder-CEO of Liberty Energy, has called climate activists alarmist and likened Democrats' push for renewables to Soviet-style communism. In a video posted to his LinkedIn profile last year, he said: ""There is no climate crisis, and we're not in the midst of an energy transition either."" Commerce secretary - Howard Lutnick Lutnick was the co-chair of Trump's transition team. Trump said Lutnick, as a member of the cabinet, would spearhead the administration's ""tariff and trade agenda"". The billionaire and former CEO of the investment firm Cantor Fitzgerald is overseeing 50,000 employees tasked with growing the economy and creating jobs, among other goals. Education secretary - Linda McMahon World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE) co-founder and Trump transition co-chair, McMahon, was picked for education secretary. A long-time Trump ally, McMahon led the Small Business Administration during Trump's first presidency and donated millions of dollars to his presidential campaign. Trump has promised to shut down the education department - a job McMahon could be tasked with if she wins Senate confirmation. ""I wholeheartedly support and agree with this mission,"" she said during her confirmation hearing. Treasury secretary - Scott Bessent Scott Bessent leads the Treasury Department, a post with wide oversight of tax policy, public debt, international finance and sanctions. A Wall Street financier who once worked for liberal billionaire George Soros, Bessent was an early backer of Trump's 2024 bid and brings a relatively conventional resume to the role. On the campaign trail, Bessent told voters that Trump would usher in a ""new golden age with de-regulation, low-cost energy, [and] low taxes"". ""[He] has long been a strong advocate of the America First Agenda,"" Trump said about his pick. Labour secretary - Lori Chavez-DeRemer Chavez-DeRemer has been selected by Trump to lead the US Department of Labor - which oversees worker health and safety and workforce laws and administers unemployment and workers compensation. Chavez-DeRemer had been serving in the US Congress since 2023 but lost her re-election bid in Oregon in the November election, despite winning strong trade union support. Housing secretary - Scott Turner Turner, an NFL veteran and motivational speaker, leads the US Department of Housing and Urban Development (Hud), which aims to address the country's housing needs. Typically, Hud enforces laws, prevents discrimination and provides assistance to those in need, through both low-income housing and helping Americans avoid foreclosure. Turner served as the executive director of the White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council during Trump's first term. Agriculture secretary - Brooke Rollins Rollins grew up on a farm, but her most recent job was as co-founder and head of the America First Policy Institute, a think tank to promote Trump's public policy agenda. Rollins graduated from the Texas A&M University with a degree in agriculture development and later obtained her law degree from the same university. As agriculture secretary, she oversees farm subsidies, federal nutrition programmes, meat inspections and other facets of the country's agricultural industry. Outside the 15 department heads who make up the core of the cabinet, there are several other roles that are often given cabinet-rank, like the FBI director and the head of the Environment Protection Agency (EPA). Some of them require Senate approval, but others do not. Here are some of the important names: Department of Government Efficiency - Elon Musk Trump tapped close ally and billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk to lead what he has termed a Department of Government Efficiency. It is not a cabinet-level department or agency approved by Congress, but it does include paid staff with access to various government agencies. Known as Doge - a nod to a cryptocurrency promoted by Musk - it serves in an advisory capacity to ""dismantle government bureaucracy, slash excess regulations, cut wasteful expenditures and restructure federal agencies"", Trump said. Musk, the world's richest man, has proven to be one of Trump's most controversial picks as he has suggested massive cuts to the federal workforce and government funding. Other names to know:"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yxv0yj40ko,Trump orders copper probe in first step to tariffs,2025-02-25T22:13:02.650Z,Natalie Sherman,"US President Donald Trump has ordered an investigation of copper imports in what is a first step toward potential tariffs on the metal. Administration officials said the White House wanted to find ways to boost US production of copper, a component used to make electric cars, ships and data centres that they said was vital to national security. The move launches a process that Trump previously used to put tariffs on steel and aluminium, opening a new front in his trade war. Trump has already raised tariffs on goods from China, while threatening a range of more sweeping trade actions, including a 25% border tax on goods from Canada and Mexico and new ""reciprocal"" tariffs set for each country. The trade fights have drawn threats of retaliation, while raising alarm among consumers and businesses in the US about higher costs. Concerns about the plans have contributed to a sharp drop in consumer confidence on recent surveys. But administration officials said on Tuesday they believed this action was necessary to protect US copper companies from competition from China. ""China has long used industrial capacity and dumping as an economic weapon to dominate global markets, systematically undercutting competitors and driving rivals out of business,"" Trump trade advisor Peter Navarro said. ""It's time for copper to come home,"" Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said. Tariffs are taxes charged on goods imported from other countries, which are paid by the company that is bringing in the goods. They are intended to support domestic production by making imports more expensive. The US is already a major copper producer, while also importing the metal mainly from Chile, Canada and Mexico. China's global copper exports rose last year, as domestic demand weakened, and authorities raced to curb production. The so-called 232 investigation by the Commerce Department will look at copper imports, as well as imports of copper ""derivatives"". The timeline of the probe was not clear. On a background briefing about the action, a White House official said the results of the investigation would inform the level of possible tariffs."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2erg38vjx8o,Who is Doge's official leader? White House says it's not Musk,2025-02-25T21:50:30.874Z,Kayla Epstein,"On Monday afternoon, a federal judge had a simple question for the Trump administration's lawyers: Is tech billionaire Elon Musk the Department of Government Efficiency's administrator? The agency more popularly known as ""Doge"" is Musk's brainchild, but the White House insists that he is not its leader - or even employed by it. Justice department lawyer Bradley Humphreys told the judge that: ""I don't have any information beyond he's a close adviser to the president."" White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt doubled down on this position at a Tuesday press briefing. ""The president tasked Elon Musk to oversee the Doge effort,"" she said, but she later added that ""career officials"" and appointees were helping Musk run Doge, and that people who have ""onboarded"" as federal employees were working at various agencies. She declined to provide specific names, but she announced that Musk would attend President Donald Trump's first cabinet secretary meeting alongside the Secretary of Defense, the Attorney General and other top US political appointees who were vetted and confirmed by the Senate. The White House later told the BBC that a person named Amy Gleason is the acting administrator. They did not provide additional details about her or when she was appointed. Ms Gleason declined to comment, CBS News reported. Musk has been leading an outside effort to aggressively curtail government spending through funding cuts and firings. ""They're playing a game,"" said Max Stier, president and CEO of the non-partisan Partnership for Public Service, an organisation that has provided past administrations with procedure and ethics guidance. ""If [Musk] were actually the administrator, then this issue about him needing Senate confirmation and his actually having to abide by the conflict of interest laws would be much clearer."" Experts said that Musk has given the impression of being in charge of Doge by staffing the government entity with employees and engineers from his various companies, posting constantly about its work on X, appearing alongside Trump in the Oval Office to promote the cuts it has made to the federal workforce, and representing it on stage at the Conservative Political Action Committee gathering last week while wielding a chainsaw. ""We're in Alice in Wonderland right now,"" Mr Stier said. ""We're through the looking glass."" Trump established Doge by renaming the United States Digital Service - an agency focused on digital and web infrastructure - to the United States Doge Service via an executive order. The order establishes Doge's leadership structure, saying that ""there shall be a USDS Administrator"" that reports up to the White House chief of staff. It does not name a specific individual for the role. In fact, Musk's name never appears in the executive order, though Trump has credited his work with the team. Doge's arrival has caused turbulence in the existing US Digital Service ranks. The administration fired several staffers there earlier this month, and the Associated Press reported that 21 employees resigned in protest on Tuesday. In a letter to management, they alleged Doge employees were creating ""significant security risks"". ""We swore to serve the American people and uphold our oath to the Constitution across presidential administrations,"" their letter stated, according to the AP. ""However, it has become clear that we can no longer honor those commitments."" BBC News has reviewed the letter but has not been able to verify its contents. A series of lawsuits challenging Doge have slowed some of the administration's effort to cut the federal workforce, and they have forced the Trump White House to face the question of Musk's status in court. Until the administration stated that Ms Gleason was the acting administrator late on Tuesday, it gave vague answers about Doge's leadership across multiple lawsuits. Though she did not rule in the hearing on Monday, Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly expressed concern about Doge's constitutionality. She noted it might run afoul of the appointment clause of the US Constitution, which sets out nominating procedures for agency leaders. ""It does seem to me if you have people that are not authorised to carry out some of these functions that they're carrying out that does raise an issue,"" she said. ""I would hope that by now we would know who is the administrator, who is the acting administrator and what authority do they have?"" Experts say that Musk's work does not fit the traditional definition of ""special government employee"", which has specific rules. The White House has previously said that Musk ""is a special government employee and has abided by all applicable federal laws"". William Resh, a professor who studies the executive branch at the University of Southern California, said typically such employees have been hired as advisers for their relative expertise. ""But they do not hold distinct executive power the way that a Senate-confirmed appointee would, or even a unilateral permanent appointments that a president can make,"" he said. While Musk appears to have made several moves regarding the federal workforce largely unencumbered, his recent demand that federal employees list five accomplishments in an email was met with pushback from some Trump-appointed agency leaders. The directive was walked back as optional at some agencies, over concerns staff could reveal sensitive information and that the order violated federal policies. Asked whether this showed tension between Doge and Trump's other officials, Leavitt insisted that ""everyone is working together as one unified team at the direction of President Trump"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj0qrj20g5vo,Key US agencies tell staff not to answer Musk email on what they did last week,2025-02-25T19:05:42.067Z,Ana Faguy,"Key US departments within the Trump administration have told staff not to comply with a Saturday email from Elon Musk's cost-cutting initiative asking what they accomplished in the past week. The FBI, state department and Pentagon were among agencies that instructed employees not to answer the message. Other department heads advised staff to comply, while some told workers to wait for further guidance before responding. Musk said failure to respond by Monday at midnight would be interpreted as the employee resigning. President Donald Trump has yet to comment on the email. The conflicting guidance caused confusion for hundreds of thousands of government bureaucrats as Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) task force leads an outside effort to aggressively reduce government spending. The message sent to millions of federal employees on Saturday evening came after Musk posted on his social media platform X that government staff would ""shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week"". In a copy of the email obtained by the BBC, employees were asked to respond explaining their accomplishments from the past week in five bullet points - without disclosing classified information. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal government's human resources agency, confirmed the email was authentic. The message did not mention whether declining to comply could affect employment status, despite Musk's social media assertion that ""failure to respond will be taken as a resignation"". The message also appears to be at odds with an assessment released in February by OPM that said any responses to government-wide emails must be ""explicitly voluntary"". Newly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel told his staff in a separate email later on Saturday that they should ""pause any responses"". ""FBI personnel may have received an email from OPM requesting information,"" Patel wrote in a message obtained by CBS News. ""The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with the FBI procedures."" The state department sent a similar message, saying leadership would respond on behalf of the agency. ""No employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command,"" an email from Tibor Nagy, acting undersecretary for management, said. The Pentagon told its staff: ""When and if required, the Department will coordinate responses to the email you have received from OPM."" The Department of Homeland Security, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and the director of US spy agencies gave their employees similar instructions, according to reports. In a sign that the OPM email may have come as a surprise to many agencies, a senior figure at the Department of Justice wrote to staff on Saturday evening to say: ""Media reports indicate the email was distributed to employees throughout the federal government."" The message added that ""at this point, we have no reason to believe this message is spam or malicious"". Later on Saturday evening, a follow-up email was sent clarifying that the OPM message was ""legitimate"" and that ""employees should be prepared to follow the instructions as requested"". The justice department message also came with a warning to staff: ""Do not include any sensitive, confidential, or classified information in your response. Should you have any questions about the contents of your response please contact your supervisor. ""If we receive additional guidance or information, I will update all employees, as necessary."" Agencies such as the Department of Transportation, the Secret Service and the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Agency also encouraged their staff to comply, reports said. Other departments, including the National Security Agency, the Internal Revenue Service and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, requested that employees await further guidance. OPM did not immediately respond to the BBC's inquiry about whether some staff might be exempt. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing federal employees, criticised the message as ""cruel and disrespectful"" and threatened to sue. It is unclear how the email affects any of the roughly three million federal workers who may not have had access their emails this weekend. Other government employees, such as those at the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, were placed on leave in the last month. The message came hours after Trump praised Musk's work on social media, adding: ""I would like to see him get more aggressive."" The Democratic ranking member on the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform hit out at the directive in a letter to the OPM. Congressman Gerry Connolly of Virginia wrote that the agency should ""immediately clarify that federal employees' nonresponse to this ill-conceived, weekend email does not constitute resignation"". ""This threat is illegal, reckless, and yet another example of the cruel and arbitrary chaos Mr Musk is inflicting on the people's government and its dedicated public servants."" Most Republican members of Congress have been defending Musk and his broader efforts. Congressman Mike Lawler of New York told ABC on Sunday that Musk's efforts were a ""comprehensive, forensic audit of every department and agency in the federal government"". But Senator John Curtis, a Republican representing Utah, criticised Musk's methods, even as said he supported the ultimate goal of Doge. ""If I could say one thing to Elon Musk, it's like, please put a dose of compassion in this. These are real people. These are real lives. These are mortgages,"" Curtis told CBS."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y0de4wpvlo,How a dramatic day at the UN deepened cracks between Europe and US,2025-02-25T18:11:49.477Z,Nada Tawfik,"A dramatic day of high stakes diplomacy at the United Nations has exposed growing cracks in the transatlantic alliance since President Donald Trump returned to the global stage and massively shifted US foreign policy. When Russia invaded Ukraine three years ago, Europe had no stronger partner than the United States. But this week, in the halls of the General Assembly and at the Security Council, the US worked against its closest allies and sided with Russia, Belarus and North Korea to pass resolutions on the conflict in Ukraine. To mark the third anniversary of Moscow's invasion, Ukraine sought a symbolic General Assembly resolution that would require the 193-member body to reaffirm Kyiv's territorial integrity and call for Russia to withdraw its forces in line with the UN charter. That resolution did pass on Monday, but with less support than in past years. Many members abstained to avoid a tricky tension created by the US. Washington's diplomats had urged other countries to vote against the measure and to instead support their ""forward looking resolution"" that was only three short paragraphs. It took a neutral stance on the war, without blaming Russia, and called for a swift end with a lasting peace to follow. Washington not only introduced their measure in the General Assembly where every nation's vote is equal, but also in the more powerful Security Council. Resolutions there are legally binding - though sometimes hard to enforce - and there had never been council action on Ukraine because of Russia's veto power as a permanent member. The move caught Europe off guard. One European diplomat told the BBC that the US behaved like a bully and did not take into account their stance on their continent's security. Another who sits on the Security Council, Slovenia's ambassador Samuel Zbogar, told the BBC that Europe is struggling to adjust to the 180-degree change in the US position - and the speed at which Washington is moving. He said the European Union will need to do some reflecting at the body's council meeting next week. ""Leaders will have to develop a plan on how the EU can actively be involved in finding peace, rather than reacting to what others are doing. It's up to us now in Europe to come forward,"" he told the BBC. There were plenty of reactions in the halls of UN headquarters in New York, as European leaders worked to reconcile with the latest US position. The UK's ambassador, Dame Barbara Woodward, and French UN Ambassador Nicolas De Riviere attempted to have the Security Council vote postponed, arguing that council members needed more time to consider the text and negotiate. Interestingly, the Chinese were willing to give more time for discussions, but the US and Russia, who are usually on opposite sides of issues on the council, both were against postponement. European members of the council then tried to introduce amendments, as they had successfully done earlier in the General Assembly resolution which led to the US abstaining on its own resolution. In the Security Council, the US threatened to block the proposed amendments to name Russia as the aggressor, reaffirm Ukraine's borders and call for a just peace. They said that it detracted from what Washington was trying to achieve and pursued a war of words rather than an end to the conflict. In the end, the US didn't have to use its veto because Russia voted to block the amended language. The US's neutral resolution then ultimately passed, breaking through three years of Security Council paralysis on the topic of Ukraine because of Russia's veto power. Just months ago, it would have seemed unthinkable that the first resolution adopted regarding the conflict would be one with such limited language - let alone that a resolution like this would be proposed by the US, condoned by Russia and passed without the full support of Europe's five council members. But the US hailed the development, the first action by the council to call for an end to the war. Others were not so celebratory. Richard Gowan, UN Director of the Crisis Group, said after three years of deepening animosity between Russia and the US at the UN, the sight of the two powers coordinating to embarrass Europe was pretty stunning. He said while everyone expected President Trump to be disruptive at the UN, this went beyond most people's expectations. ""The US lobbying against the European-Ukrainian resolution was very crude. US officials were reportedly threatening to cut aid to non-compliant states. This has left a nasty taste among many UN members,"" Mr Gowan said.

The court ruled 5-3 in favour of Glossip, reversing an Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals ruling. The move comes after the state's Republican attorney general joined Glossip in calling for a new trial. Glossip, 62, was convicted in the 1997 murder of the owner of an Oklahoma City motel where he worked. He has had nine execution dates postponed, and eaten his ""last meal"" three times. Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in Tuesday's opinion for the court: ""We conclude that the prosecution violated its constitutional obligation to correct false testimony."" She was joined in the ruling by fellow liberal justices Elena Kagan and Ketanji Brown Jackson. Brett Kavanaugh and Chief Justice John Roberts, both conservatives, also joined the opinion. Justice Amy Coney Barrett, another conservative, agreed with the opinion but said she would have sent the case back for more proceedings. Justice Neil Gorsuch did not join in the case. Don Knight, an attorney for Glossip, called the ruling ""a victory for justice and fairness in our judicial system"". The defence lawyer said Glossip will be given the chance to have a fair trial ""that he has always been denied"". It will be up to Oklahoma prosecutors to determine how to proceed with his case. Glossip has maintained his innocence for 27 years. His boss, Barry Van Treese, owner of the Best Budget Inn motel in Oklahoma City , was beaten to death with a baseball bat in 1997. Glossip's colleague, Justin Sneed, was convicted of the killing, but said Glossip had told him to carry out the murder. Sneed confessed to the murder but was able to evade execution by accepting a plea deal that involved testifying that Glossip paid him $10,000 to do it. Glossip admitted to assisting Sneed in covering up the murder after it happened, but denied knowing of any plan to kill Van Treese. It has since emerged that prosecutors did not disclose that Sneed, a methamphetamine addict, had been treated for a serious psychiatric condition. ""Had the prosecution corrected Sneed on the stand, his credibility plainly would have suffered,"" Justice Sotomayor wrote. ""That correction would have revealed to the jury not just that Sneed was untrustworthy ... but also that Sneed was willing to lie to them under oath."" Glossip was first convicted in 1998, but that was overturned in 2001. He was convicted again three years later. In 2015, just a few steps away from the execution chamber, his execution was halted to review the lethal injection drugs. In 2023, the Supreme Court intervened after Oklahoma's attorney general and Glossip asked for a new trial. A number of big names have backed Glossip's efforts in the past including Pope Francis, Kim Kardashian and Sir Richard Branson."

""I am running to be the governor of a great state at the heart of the greatest nation known to mankind,"" he told a crowd of supporters. Ramaswamy, a former Republican presidential candidate, was selected by Donald Trump after exiting the race to co-lead the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) alongside Elon Musk, but left the job to pursue elected office. His candidacy was given an early boost of momentum after receiving an endorsement from President Trump. ""He will be a great Governor of Ohio, will never let you down, and has my complete and total endorsement,"" Trump said on his social media platform on Monday. Ramaswamy, 39, quickly became a Trump ally after exiting the Republican primary, where he pitched himself as a political outsider - like Trump - who wanted to develop the president's ""America First"" agenda. After a fourth-place finish in the Iowa caucuses, he left the race and became a vocal Trump supporter. He was later selected to co-lead Doge alongside the Tesla CEO and billionaire Musk. He is running to succeed current Republican Governor Mike DeWine, considered a moderate conservative, who has spoken out against Trump in the past. Speaking to hundreds gathered inside a hulking aerospace warehouse in a suburb of Cincinnati, Ramaswamy framed his candidacy in the image of Trump. ""President Trump is reviving our conviction in America. We require a leader here at home who will revive our conviction in Ohio,"" Ramaswamy said. Ohio's Republican primary election will be held next year along with the nationwide elections for Congress. Like Musk, Ramaswamy previously backed government-slashing proposals such as eliminating the FBI and the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The native Ohioan also expressed a desire to ""gut"" the programme for H-1B visa workers, used to hire skilled foreign workers in the US, arguing that American culture has ""venerated mediocrity over excellence"". Ramaswamy, a wealthy pharmaceutical entrepreneur, was estimated by Forbes last year to have a net worth of $960m (£758m)."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1jpg0069wgo,Theranos founder Elizabeth Holmes loses fraud appeal,2025-02-25T12:17:56.688Z,Mallory Moench,"Theranos founder and former chief executive Elizabeth Holmes has lost an appeal against her conviction for defrauding investors in her blood-testing company. Holmes was sentenced to more than 11 years in prison. In her appeal, she challenged trial evidence and testimony and argued that statements by her ex-business and romantic partner Ramesh ""Sunny"" Balwani about his level of responsibility for Theranos' financial model should have been included. He was jailed for more than 12 years. The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals rejected the arguments. Judge Jacqueline H Nguyen wrote that Theranos's claim of being able to run blood tests with a drop from a finger prick instead of a needle in a vein was ""nothing more than a mirage"". ""The grandiose achievements touted by Holmes and Balwani were half-truths and outright lies,"" Nguyen wrote in the opinion on behalf of a three-judge panel published on Monday. Holmes was convicted in 2022 of conspiracy and multiple charges of wire fraud for misleading investors over the company's financial health and the effectiveness of its technology. Balwani, who was tried separately and additionally convicted of defrauding patients in 2022, also lost his appeal. In the appeal, both challenged a court order to pay $452m (£358m) in restitution to victims, which the court upheld. In Holmes's appeal, she argued that statements from Balwani where he said he ""owned"" the company's financial model should have been included in the trial. The appeal also argued that former Theranos employees offered improper expert testimony and a government inspection report should not have been included as evidence - all arguments the court dismissed. Silicon Valley start-up Theranos was once valued at $9bn (£7bn). But in late 2015, news reporting revealed internal struggles at the company and exposed the limitations of its technology. After a two-and-a-half-year investigation, a grand jury indicted Holmes and Balwani, leading to their convictions and sentencings. Holmes entered prison in Texas in 2023."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2kgxk9eqk1o,Trump dominates Liberal leadership debate in Canada,2025-02-25T04:25:40.435Z,Nadine Yousif,"Candidates vying to replace Prime Minister Justin Trudeau as leader of the Liberal Party of Canada faced each other for the first time on Monday in a French-language debate. The stage was shared by four hopefuls: former governor of the banks of Canada and England Mark Carney, former Finance Minister Chrystia Freeland, Liberal government House leader Karina Gould, and businessman and former MP Frank Baylis. The question of how to deal with Donald Trump dominated the first half, as the US president has repeatedly threatened to tariff Canada and make it the ""51st state."" Candidates also answered questions about domestic matters like immigration, healthcare and the high cost of living. Early in the debate, Freeland - whose resignation as finance minister in December triggered the collapse of Trudeau's leadership - stated that Trump represented ""the greatest threat to Canada since World War Two"". She frequently drew on her experience in government, saying that she had successfully faced Trump during his first term when she helped renegotiate North America's longstanding free-trade agreement. But Freeland warned that Trump's second term might be worse for Canada. ""He wants to turn Canada into the 51st state, and it's no joke,"" she said. ""That is why he is supporting [Russian President] Vladimir Putin's criminal attempt to redraw Ukraine's borders."" ""Trump wants to redraw our borders too,"" Freeland said.  To counter these threats, Freeland and the other candidates suggested strengthening trade ties with the EU and the UK. Baylis proposed a ""new economic bloc"" consisting of Canada, the UK, New Zealand and Australia, noting that all four countries shared the same values, cultures and governing systems. Carney, who is frontrunner in the polls, focused his message on helping Canada achieve economic prosperity. He proposed doing so by leveraging its resources, including critical minerals and metals, as well as making Canada a ""superpower of clean energy"" and removing trade barriers between provinces. He, too, agreed with Freeland that Trump's second term was different from the first. ""He is more isolationist. He is more aggressive,"" Carney said. ""In the past he wanted our markets. Now he wants our country."" He added that he would be in favour of imposing dollar-for-dollar tariffs on the US should Trump move ahead with his threat to levy a 25% tax on all Canadian goods starting on 4 March. Gould, the youngest candidate on the stage, positioned herself as the candidate ""for today and the future"", with a message that homed in on how a Liberal Party under her leadership would work to make life more affordable for Canadians. The candidates also addressed shifting US policy on Ukraine. As the four debated, Trudeau was in Kyiv marking three years since the Russia-Ukraine war began. All four candidates agreed that Canada should continue supporting Ukraine. Freeland suggested that money seized from Russia through sanctions be redistributed to help Ukraine's war effort, while Carney stated that any discussion on Ukraine's future could not happen without the Ukrainians at the table. Freeland also suggested that Canada should foster closer ties with Denmark which, she noted. was also facing threats from Trump who has signalled his desire to take over Greenland - a Danish territory. For the second half of the debate, candidates offered up their ideas for how to help Canada reduce its federal budget deficit, tackle crime and increase its military spending. They were also asked about climate change, with both Freeland and Carney saying they no longer supported a carbon tax on consumers - a key climate policy of the Trudeau government that has become unpopular with Canadians. At certain points, candidates also took aim at Conservative Party leader Pierre Poilievre, saying he would be unfit to defend Canada against Trump. Poilievre is currently leading in the national polls, though the gap between him and the Liberal Party has narrowed since Trudeau's resignation. The Conservative leader has since focused his attacks on Carney, arguing that a Liberal Party under his leadership would not be different from that under Trudeau. Monday's debate is the first of two, with a second, English-language debate slated for Tuesday. Liberal Party members will vote for their next leader on 9 March, after which Trudeau is expected to step down. The French-language debate is especially important for Francophone Canadians in Quebec, whose votes are influential in helping decide which party will form Canada's next government. Whoever is elected as leader would become Canada's next prime minister until the next general election, which must be held on or before 20 October."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz2xk7d9xo,Federal workers left confused as Musk doubles down on threat,2025-02-25T04:11:27.366Z,Kayla Epstein,"US government workers faced widespread confusion on Monday following conflicting advice over compliance with an Elon Musk-backed order to list their last week's work in an email or face termination. Just 48 hours after an email asking ""what did you do last week?"" was sent, the office behind it clarified responses were voluntary, leaving agencies to decide their approach. But as this new guidance was shared with federal agencies, President Donald Trump weighed in that workers who did not comply with Mr Musk's demand would be fired or ""sort of semi-fired"". And later on Monday evening, Mr Musk reinforced the ultimatum, granting workers a final chance to respond. The mail from the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) on Saturday, instructed recipients to reply with five examples of what they did over the past seven days, without revealing any classified information. The recipients were asked to respond by end of Monday. Mr Musk, who is leading the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), said that failure to respond would be taken as a resignation. The comments fuelled backlash, with federal worker unions and activist groups filing a lawsuit in California to halt the email mandate. Key agencies, including the Departments of Defense, Health and Human Services (HHS), Justice, and the FBI—now led by Trump appointees—instructed employees to ignore the directive. This led to widespread uncertainty, with some workers receiving contradictory messages over the weekend. The result was widespread bafflement, as federal workers faced uncertainty over their employment. Many also expressed confusion at the competing guidance they had been given by their respective agencies. ""They're succeeding in driving us insane,"" one employee who works under HHS told the BBC, and asked not to be named for fear of retaliation. On Monday afternoon, OPM held a call with the heads of human resources at federal agencies and said it was up to each entity to determine how they want to handle the directive employees received Saturday, according to CBS News, the BBC's US partner. The same afternoon, President Trump told reporters at the White House that Mr Musk's demand was a ""genius"" move. ""There was a lot of genius in sending it,"" he said. ""We're trying to find out if people are working and so we're sending a letter to people, please tell us what you did last week. If people don't respond, it's very possible that there is no such person or they're not working."" ""And then if you don't answer like you're sort of semi-fired or you're fired because a lot of people are not answering because they don't even exist,"" Trump said. Mr Musk maintained he was acting on instructions from President Donald Trump. ""Subject to the discretion of the President, they will be given another chance,"" he wrote on X, apparently referring to workers who did not respond to his demand by the end of Monday. ""Failure to respond a second time will result in termination."" ""The email request was utterly trivial, as the standard for passing the test was to type some words and press send!"" he said in another post. ""Yet so many failed even that inane test, urged on in some cases by their managers. Have you ever witnessed such INCOMPETENCE and CONTEMPT for how YOUR TAXES are being spent?"" Despite pushback from agencies led by Trump appointees, the White House insisted, ""Everyone is working together as one unified team at the direction of President Trump"". ""Any notion to the contrary is completely false,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said. The statement did not explain why different government agencies were giving different recommendations."

Clint Hill later became a bestselling author, but was haunted for decades by guilt over Kennedy's assassination. Hill died at his home on California on Friday, according to a statement from his publicist. On 22 November 1963, he was assigned to protect the president's wife, Jacqueline Kennedy. Hill was riding on a car behind the Kennedy limousine when the first shot rang out. He immediately rushed towards the couple and started to climb on to the back of the limousine as the shooting continued. Hill's actions during the assassination were captured on the Zapruder film – an amateur home movie that provided one of the best recordings of the shooting. Hill, originally from North Dakota, served in the Army prior to joining the Secret Service in 1958. He was given an award for his actions in Dallas and eventually rose to become assistant director of the Secret Service. However the trauma he experienced during the assassination led him to retire early from the agency in 1975, at the age of 43. He had become convinced that he could have saved Kennedy's life and shortly after his retirement told CBS 60 Minutes that he felt responsible. ""If I had reacted about five-tenths of a second faster, maybe a second faster, I wouldn't be here today,"" Hill said. ""You mean you would have gotten there and you would have taken the shot?"" asked interviewer Mike Wallace. ""Yes, sir... That would have been fine with me,"" Hill responded. ""I have a great deal of guilt about that,"" he said. ""Had I turned in a different direction, I'd have made it. It's my fault."" As the years went by, the former Secret Service agent later told a documentary, he returned to Dallas, eventually coming to the conclusion he could not have saved Kennedy's life. Hill met journalist Lisa McCubbin in 2009 and collaborated on a bestselling memoir, Mrs Kennedy and Me. It was the first of a series of books and Hill and McCubbin fell in love. The couple married in 2021. A statement from his publisher said that Hill had died at home with his wife at his side. A cause of death was not given."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd650zdwe8do,Judge declines to immediately restore AP access to White House,2025-02-25T00:23:33.143Z,Bernd Debusmann Jr,"A US judge has declined a request by the Associated Press to immediately restore its access to presidential events after the Trump administration blocked the agency in a dispute over the term ""Gulf of America"". US District Judge Trevor McFadden, a Trump appointee, declined to grant the news outlet's emergency motion, but set another hearing for the case for 20 March. The news agency has refused to change its style from the Gulf of Mexico to the ""Gulf of America"", after President Donald Trump renamed it with an executive order. The AP argues the ban is retaliatory and infringes on First Amendment rights to freedom of speech and the press. The ban has meant that the AP - which hundreds of news outlets rely on - has been unable to access press events at the White House as well as Air Force One. Last week, the US President said that he planned to ""keep them out"" until they begin using the term ""Gulf of America"". After the ruling on Monday, the White House said it stood by its decision to block access to the news agency. ""As we have said from the beginning, asking the President of the United States questions in the Oval Office and aboard Air Force One is a privilege granted to journalists, not a legal right,"" the Trump administration said in a statement. ""We stand by our decision to hold the Fake News accountable for their lies, and President Trump will continue to grant an unprecedented level of access to the press."" Shortly after the judge's decision became public, the White House put up two large electric signs in the briefing room which say ""Victory"" and ""Gulf of America"". The AP, meanwhile, said in a statement that it was looking forward to the next hearing where ""we will continue to stand for the right of the press and the public to speak freely without government retaliation. This is a fundamental American freedom"". Soon after taking office in January, the Trump administration signed an executive order renaming the Gulf of Mexico to the ""Gulf of America"", a move the White House said reflects the gulf's status as ""an indelible part of America"".  The AP said it would continue to use the term Gulf of Mexico, while acknowledging the Trump administration's efforts to rename it. In response, the administration began clamping down on the AP's access to White House events covered by the ""pool"" of journalists that cover smaller events and report back to other media outlets. On Monday, Judge McFadden said he declined the request from the AP for emergency relief because he did not believe the publication was suffering ""irreparable harm"" from the ban, according to CNN. The judge said the AP could access the same information from notes that other White House pool members had gathered. Still, during several points in the hearing, he called the ban ""discriminatory"" and problematic"", CNN reported. AP reporters still have access to the White House grounds. The AP lawsuit specifically names three administration figures - Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt, chief of staff Susie Wiles and deputy chief of staff Taylor Budowich -as it seeks to regain access. ""The press and all people in the United States have the right to choose their own words and not be retaliated against by the government,"" the AP said in the lawsuit. On a trip with the White House pool to Florida last week, the BBC witnessed an AP reporter and one of its photographers be told by an official that they were a ""no go"" for the trip after clearing security at Joint Base Andrews a short while before Air Force One was due to depart. Over the course of the next several days, the AP team - which had travelled to Florida unilaterally - was repeatedly prevented from joining the pool of reporters covering Trump at his estate in Mar-a-Lago, as well as a trip to the Daytona 500 Nascar race. Speaking to reporters at Mar-a-Lago on 18 February, Trump said that ""we're going to keep them out until such time as they agree that it's the Gulf of America"". ""We're very proud of this country,"" he said. ""We want it to be the Gulf of America"". Last week, dozens of news organisations - including conservative outlets such as Fox and NewsMax - signed a letter organised by the White House Correspondents' Association in which they urged the White House to reconsider its stance on the AP."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3904r98lnlo,Who might replace Trudeau as Liberal Party leader?,2025-02-24T21:01:44.235Z,Jessica Murphy & Nadine Yousif,"The race to replace Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is now set, with former central banker Mark Carney and former Deputy Prime Minister Chrystia Freeland the two biggest names to have declared their candidacy. Trudeau will step down from the role after nine years as PM once his governing Liberals find a new leader. They will announce the winner on 9 March. The new leader is expected to be soon thrust into a general election and will also have to take on the threats tariffs proposed by US President Donald Trump. Many prominent cabinet ministers chose not to run, including Finance Minister Dominic LeBlanc, Foreign Minister Melanie Joly and Industry Minister François-Philippe Champagne, who all said they need to focus on their current duties. The early race has narrowed with Jaime Battiste, a member of parliament (MP) from the Atlantic province of Nova Scotia, dropping out. Another hopeful, former Toronto area MP Ruby Dhalla, was kicked out of the race over ""extremely serious"" violations, the party said. Those include allegations of inaccuracies in her campaign's financial reporting. Ms Dhalla has appealed the decision. Here are the four still in the running to be the Liberals' next leader. In his campaign launch, former Bank of Canada and Bank of England governor Mark Carney pitched himself as a strong fiscal manager who can help countries navigate challenging times. ""I've helped manage multiple crises, and I've helped save two economies,"" he said in his speech. ""I know how business works, and I know how to make it work for you."" He also noted the tariff threat from Trump, saying that Canada is facing extraordinary times. Carney, 59, was born in Canada's Northwest Territories and grew up in Edmonton, Alberta. In his announcement, he sought to highlight his Canadian roots and paint himself as a political outsider. He has been serving in recent months as a special economics adviser to Trudeau, has long been considered a contender for the top job, though the Harvard graduate has never held public office. Trudeau himself admitted that he had long been trying to recruit Carney to his team. Carney tried to distance himself from the unpopular PM, saying he is ""not the only Liberal in Canada who believes that the prime minister and his team let their attention wander from the economy too often"". Carney brings with him expertise on environmental matters through his role as the United Nations special envoy on climate action, recently calling the goal of net zero ""the greatest commercial opportunity of our time"". He is a champion of some Liberal policies that have been unpopular, like the federal carbon tax, the party's signature climate policy that critics argue is a financial burden for Canadians. He has recently back away from the policy, saying in May that it had ""served a purpose up until now"". He has received a number of cabinet endorsements, including Environment Minister Steven Guilbeault and Foreign Affairs Minister Melanie Joly. The Toronto member of parliament became one of the most well-known members of Trudeau's team. While she had long been seen as a trusted senior official in his inner circle, a rift with the prime minister's office led to her recent abrupt resignation in December. That was a blow to Trudeau's already-shaky hold on power, helping to usher in his own resignation. The two disagreed on how to address President Trump's threat of tariffs, among other financial policies as Canada faced a C$60bn deficit ($42bn; £33bn). Born to a Ukrainian mother in the western province of Alberta, the 56-year-old was a journalist before entering politics. She entered the House of Commons in 2013 and two years later joined Trudeau's cabinet with a trade brief after he swept the party to power. As Minister of Foreign Affairs she helped Canada renegotiate a free trade deal with the US and Mexico. She was later named deputy prime minister and minister of finance and oversaw Canada's financial response to the Covid pandemic. A 2019 Globe and Mail profile said depending who you asked, Freeland is either a last, best hope for the liberal world order or an out-of-touch idealist. Her steadfast support of Ukraine earned praise in some quarters but the Harvard-educated MP has had her share of critics, including Trump who recently called her ""toxic"". In her launch - walking onto the stage to the 1982 song ""Maneater"" - she leaned into her time renegotiating a trade deal under the first Trump administration, and said she would take on the president again. ""I will lead a true Canadian response to the threat we now face. We will be united, we will be strong, we will be smart and that's why we will win,"" she told the crowd of supporters. She has received the backing of Health Minister Mark Holland and Justice Minister Arif Virani, among other MPs. Karina Gould, a former trade and investment specialist, has thrown her hat in the ring, declaring she would represent a ""new generation"" if elected. She was first elected in 2015 and has served a number of roles in Trudeau's cabinet - the youngest woman to serve as a minister in Canada. The 37-year-old was families minister, international development minister and later Minister of Democratic Institutions, before taking on her current role as House Leader, where she oversees the government's legislative agenda. Gould said ""Canadians have lost trust in our party"", as she launched her bid. Frank Baylis, a former Liberal member of parliament, was the first out of the gate to announce he is seeking the leadership of the party. He has said he will bring his experience from the world of business to address the affordability and cost-of-living challenges facing Canadians. Baylis is the executive chairman of a medical device company that was founded by his mother and where he later served as president. It was sold to a US firm in 2021. He is an engineer by training. Baylis served in parliament from 2015-2019 and was a founding member of the Parliamentary Black Caucus."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwd2qrn1e2o,Trump names podcaster Dan Bongino as deputy FBI director,2025-02-24T17:41:58.346Z,Brandon Drenon,"US President Donald Trump has appointed podcaster and commentator Dan Bongino as deputy director of the FBI. Trump posted on social media that Bongino was ""a man of incredible love and passion for our Country"" and would serve under newly confirmed FBI Director Kash Patel. Bongino, 50, who has worked for the New York police department and the Secret Service, is a staunch Trump ally who has pushed false claims about the 2020 election. His appointment, which does not require Senate confirmation, means neither of the top two people running the agency has FBI experience.  ""Thank you Mr President,"" Bongino wrote on social media on Sunday night. The deputy director, who is responsible for supervising all domestic and international operations, is usually a career agent with years of experience. Bongino hosts daily podcast The Dan Bongino Show, whose Facebook posts often attract more attention than those of Fox News and CNN combined. In Friday's episode there was a segment about the FBI, in which he praised Patel and tried to allay Democratic fears the agency will be used to target Trump's enemies. ""Kash Patel is there for one reason, he is there to make the FBI great again,"" he said. He's committed to fighting crime and only that, he added, calling his new boss the ""change agent"" the FBI needs. ""How amazing would it be in four years to look back with a good, high-quality, reformed FBI free of woke culture and DEI that goes out making headline, big arrests of real bad guys destroying your community. How good would that be?"" Bongino's appointment comes with FBI in flux after the justice department forced out some of its top officials and demanded the names of agents who investigated the 2021 riot by Trump supporters at the US Capitol. Critics have said that threatened the FBI's political independence. Bongino and PateI are both seen as Trump loyalists. Bongino, on Monday on his daily radio show, addressed concerns about political partisanship in his content. ""We play different roles in our life, and each one requires a different skill set,"" he said. He later added: ""We are going to re-establish faith in this institution. The FBI belongs to the American people."" Bongino, who has run for Congress three times, hosted Trump on his podcast ahead of last year's election. Episodes of his programme from the last week include titles such as ""Trump Keeps Delivering And The Libs Are Seething"" and ""The Only People Who Love Crime Are Criminals!!!"" He has repeated Trump's false claim that he won the 2020 election and advanced another conspiracy that Joe Biden's administration was behind the FBI search for classified documents at Trump's Florida home. ""EVERYONE involved in this DOJ/FBI abomination, from the management down to the agents, must be immediately terminated when the tyrants are thrown out of office,"" he said on X. In 2018, when talking about his career as a prolific conservative political commentator, Bongino said: ""My life is all about owning the libs now."" With a combative persona, he can often be found firing back at Trump's detractors on X, including a long-running spat with horror author Stephen King. In his social media announcement on Sunday, Trump said that Bongino would give up the podcast in order to serve in the FBI role. Patel was last week narrowly confirmed by the Senate to the lead the law-enforcement agency that he has long attacked. He denied any plans to pursue political vendettas and has promised to ""rebuild"" the bureau. The FBI has 38,000 employees and a budget of more than $11bn."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr72n1yyj30o,"List weekly accomplishments or resign, Musk tells US federal workers",2025-02-23T14:33:36.271Z,Laura Blasey and Ana Faguy,"US government workers received an email on Saturday afternoon asking them to list their accomplishments from the past week or resign - the latest development in the Trump administration's efforts to scale back the federal workforce. The email came after Trump's billionaire confidant Elon Musk posted on X that employees would ""shortly receive an email requesting to understand what they got done last week"". ""Failure to respond will be taken as a resignation,"" he wrote. Musk, as the head of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), has been leading an outside effort to aggressively curtail government spending through funding cuts and firings. The email arrived in inboxes shortly after Trump spoke at the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac). The messages came with the subject line ""What did you do last week?"" from a sender listed as HR. The Office of Personnel Management (OPM), the federal government's human resources agency, confirmed the email was authentic in a statement to CBS, the BBC's US news partner. ""As part of the Trump administration's commitment to an efficient and accountable federal workforce, OPM is asking employees to provide a brief summary of what they did last week by the end of Monday, CC'ing their manager,"" it said. ""Agencies will determine any next steps."" In a copy of the email obtained by the BBC, employees were asked to explain their accomplishments from the past week in five bullet points - without disclosing classified information - before midnight on Monday. The message did not mention whether a failure to respond would be considered a resignation. The American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union representing federal employees, criticised the message as ""cruel and disrespectful"" and vowed to challenge any ""unlawful terminations"" of federal employees. ""Once again, Elon Musk and the Trump Administration have shown their utter disdain for federal employees and the critical services they provide to the American people,"" Everett Kelley, union president, said in a statement. On Sunday morning, Musk wrote on his social media platform X that ""a large number of responses have been received already"", adding: ""These are the people who should be considered for promotion."" A few hours later, Musk said on X that the move was important because ""a significant number of people who are supposed to be working for the government are doing so little work that they are not checking their email at all"". Musk went on to say that Doge believes ""non-existent people or the identities of dead people are being used to collect paychecks"", claiming ""outright fraud"" without evidence. Musk has repeatedly made claims of fraud in defending his team's work across a range of government departments and functions. But on Saturday, there appeared to be some disagreement about the latest email among government department heads. Newly-confirmed FBI director Kash Patel told his employees in an email that they should ""pause any responses"" to the OPM memo. ""FBI personnel may have received an email from OPM requesting information,"" Patel wrote in a message obtained by CBS News. ""The FBI, through the Office of the Director, is in charge of all of our review processes, and will conduct reviews in accordance with the FBI procedures."" The State Department sent a similar message to its employees and said it will respond on behalf of the department. ""No employee is obligated to report their activities outside of their Department chain of command,"" an email from Tibor Nagy, acting undersecretary for management, that was obtained by US media said. The union that represents many government employees, the American Federation of Government Employees (AFGE), was critical of the email and threatened legal action if employees were unlawfully terminated. ""It is cruel and disrespectful to hundreds of thousands of veterans who are wearing their second uniform in the civil service to be forced to justify their job duties to this out-of-touch, privileged, unelected billionaire who has never performed one single hour of honest public service in his life,"" AFGE President Everett Kelley said. Earlier in the day, Trump touted cuts and told a crowd of supporters at Cpac that the work of federal employees had been inadequate because some of them work remotely at least some of the time. ""We're removing all of the unnecessary, incompetent and corrupt bureaucrats from the federal workforce,"" the president told the crowd at the annual conference in suburban Washington on Saturday afternoon. ""We want to make government smaller, more efficient,"" he added. ""We want to keep the best people, and we're not going to keep the worst people."" Elon Musk's team has exacted wide-ranging changes to the US federal infrastructure through Doge and with approval from the White House. Thousands of government employees at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), the Pentagon and the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), as well as other agencies, have been fired in recent weeks. The email mirrors Musk's handling of employees after he acquired social media platform Twitter, now called X, in 2022. As the staff there shrunk under his ownership, he issued ultimatums that included a now-infamous request to commit to being ""extremely hardcore"" at work or resign. Trump has repeatedly applauded Musk's government-cutting measures. In a Truth Social post, Trump said that Musk is doing a ""great job"" in reducing the size of the federal government and that he would like to see him ""get more aggressive"" in the pursuit."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0ng4eyr3xo,John Simpson: 2025 could be year for the history books as Trump shreds global norms,2025-02-23T12:17:49.318Z,John Simpson,"Just occasionally, there are years when the world goes through some fundamental, convulsive change. 1968, with the Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, the Paris riots and the anti-Vietnam War protests in America, was one of them. 1989, the year of the Tiananmen massacre, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the implosion of the Soviet empire, was another. I was on hand to see each of these things happen, and from that perspective it seems to me that, only seven weeks in, 2025 could be a year like that: a time when the basic assumptions about the way our world works are fed into the shredder. The basic reason, of course, is Donald Trump. Since the end of World War Two, each one of the 13 US presidents before Trump's current term in office has at least paid lip service to a set of key geopolitical principles: that America's own security depended on protecting Europe from Russia, and the non-Communist countries of Asia against China. Trump has up-ended this approach. He says he's putting American interests first, way before everything else. Mostly that comes down to the single question of how much it costs the US. In itself, this is pretty hard for his friends and allies abroad, especially in Europe. But it's made far more difficult by Trump's own personality. No US president in modern times, not even Richard Nixon, let his personal characteristics shape his policies like Trump does. ""He's just like Louis XIV,"" one retired American diplomat said to me, referring to France's self-aggrandising Sun King. Critics like this believe Trump is both breathtakingly vain, and amazingly thin-skinned at the same time. As a result, the appointees who surround him, people like Elon Musk and JD Vance, perhaps think that their position depends entirely on how much they praise him and back his views. When President Trump claims, with no evidence, that President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine is corrupt and has a low approval rating, Musk then takes it further: he piles in to say that Zelensky is despised by the Ukrainian people and is feeding off the dead bodies of Ukrainian soldiers. No one in the Trump circle today, it seems, will cough discreetly and say, ""Mr President, maybe you should consider rowing back on that statement."" Judging from his previous term in office, we can be sure that every one of the people around him knows how he detests being disagreed with. And they will also know that many voters wholeheartedly back Trump's approach, and feel they have been bankrolling security in a far-off continent. He has committed himself to stopping the Ukraine war by Easter. He is absolutely correct when he says that President Vladimir Putin is keen on this. Russian troops are, through sheer force of numbers, making slow advances in the eastern part of Ukraine. But the cost in Russian lives is immense. If the process continues, Russia may have to turn to conscription, which would be dangerously unpopular and might even destabilise Putin's regime. Everything Trump says about getting peace is music to his ears. John Bolton, Trump's far-from-subservient national security adviser during his first administration, said the other day that they'd be breaking out the champagne in the Kremlin when they heard the Trump administration's peace plan. It certainly felt like a historic moment – not just in Moscow but around the world. Putin has pointedly backed the idea that Trump really won the 2020 election. It may not be true, but President Putin knows that Trump favours anyone who backs his view of things. Why, by contrast, have Trump and the people round him come down so hard on President Zelensky? It must partly be because he's not obediently doing what he's told, such as returning to the negotiating table and striking a deal on US access to Ukraine's critical minerals. At the same time, President Trump understands that Zelensky is the weakest link in the US-Russia-Ukraine trio, and can be squeezed in a way that Putin can't be. The more pressure that is piled on Zelensky, the quicker a peace deal will come. President Trump never seems, at least in public, to show much interest in the fine detail of any agreement. It's the agreement itself that matters to him, even if Ukraine and its allies believe it's manifestly unfair and allows Russia to come back at some future date and start the war all over again. British and German diplomats whom I know have been enraged by the way Trump went about getting Russia to the negotiating table. ""He had two major cards in his hand,"" said one. ""The first was Russia's isolation. Putin would have made plenty of concessions to get himself to the talks with America – only Trump didn't insist on any concessions at all. He just let him sit down and start talking."" The other card, the diplomat said, was to insist that Ukraine should be allowed to join Nato. ""Trump could have banged away about this and extorted all sorts of agreements from Putin, before finally saying OK, well, Ukraine won't join Nato in that case."" In European capitals it's felt that he threw away both of his essential cards before the talks even started, without any preconditions. Already, though, some European diplomats with experience of US politics are advising their governments that this grand monarchical period in Donald Trump's presidency, where his advisers defer to him (he literally referred to himself as a ""king"" this week), won't last. Trump currently has control of a pliant Congress and a conservative Supreme Court – but in only 20 months' time, in November 2026, there will be mid-term elections in the US. There are signs that inflation is starting to rise in America, and enough people may well be affected badly by the upheavals to want to punish Trump's Republicans. If he loses control of one or both Houses, the power he has at present of pushing through every plan and policy, no matter how controversial, will diminish. But an awful lot can happen in the next year and eight months. Trump's expansionism might embolden China. A major international trade war, sparked off by Trump's tariffs, could open up. The European Union seems likely to become politically and economically weaker than ever. Agreeing peace in Ukraine on Russia's terms will be something entirely new for the United States. In the great majority of negotiations since 1945, Russia has struggled to get its way because of America's economic and military strength. Now President Putin, having made the costly decision to invade Ukraine three years ago, looks likely to get away with it, and prosper. If that happens, then 2025 will indeed be remembered as a key year: a moment when the history of the world changed, and nothing was ever quite the same again."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g05gzvp57o,From Baywatch to toxic waste - LA's iconic beaches unrecognisable after fires,2025-02-23T01:58:56.527Z,Regan Morris,"With its sun-drenched lifeguard towers, bronzed surfers and bikini-clad volleyball players, Will Rogers State Beach is one of the most recognizable stretches of sand in the world thanks to the global cult classic ""Baywatch"". But now the iconic beach is surrounded by the ruins of burned homes and palm trees, its parking lot a sorting ground for hazardous waste from the wildfires. The beach babes have been replaced by Environmental Protection Agency crews in hazmat suits sifting through melted electric car batteries and other hazardous waste before it's trucked away to landfills. The Palisades and Eaton fires generated a staggering amount of debris, estimated to be 4.5 million tonnes. In comparison, the devastating Maui fires of 2023 generated about 400,000 tonnes, according to the US Army Corps of Engineers. Those fires took three months of clean-up by the EPA, which is in charge of removing hazardous waste. But now the agency is hoping to finish their job in LA in just a month - by 25 February - after President Donald Trump signed an executive order demanding the EPA ""expedite the bulk removal of contaminated and general debris"". The decision to sort through the hazardous waste along the coast has prompted protests and as the clean-up of fire debris moves at unprecedented speeds, many are asking if and when the ocean water will be safe for swimming and surfing. ""In this very vulnerable place, they're sorting this very hazardous, hazardous stuff,"" said actor and environmentalist Bonnie Wright. ""To me, this feels like 10 steps backwards, because you're literally putting this waste even closer to the beach than it already is in the burn sites."" Ms Wright, who played Ginny Weasly in the Harry Potter films, wrote a book on sustainability and devotes most of her time now to environmental causes. While their battle to move sorting sites away from the coast ultimately failed, she said activists were successful in urging the EPA to move burned electric vehicle batteries to the Will Rogers site down the road and away from the sensitive Topanga Creek watershed. The EPA said the burned vehicle batteries are an especially dangerous challenge but that the agency has the expertise to deal with them. To sift waste, they need a large space with roads big enough for truck traffic - which is why the Pacific Coast Highway, which runs along the beach, is more attractive than inside the windy, mountainous roads of the Palisades. When lithium ion batteries are damaged - especially by the high heat and flames of a wildfire - they have the potential for reigniting and exploding days, weeks, or even months after they've been impacted, said Steve Calanog, the EPA's incident commander for the LA fires. ""We have to treat them like unexploded ordinance, or, as the military calls it UXO,"" he said. Although some have questioned the speed with which the EPA has moved to clean up the toxic debris, he said there is no time to waste. ""We have to do this very quickly,"" he said, noting that they started sorting waste even as the fires were still raging. ""If we are delayed, the risk of impacting the ocean, it goes up again."" Mr Calanog was also in charge of the EPA response to the Maui fires, which may hold clues for how to measure what is safe and reasonable when it comes to testing water and soil samples. Many are concerned about the impacts of heavy metals and chemicals in the air and water after the fires. In Maui, it's been nearly 18 months since the fires and a small part of the coast around Lahaina is still closed to the public. The Army Corps of Engineers - which removes heavy debris after the EPA removes hazardous waste - just finished their last haul from Lahaina on 20 February. But most of Maui has remained open to locals and tourists and the Hawaii Department of Health announced eight months after the fires that the coastal waters around Lahaina were safe for ocean recreation. The scale of the clean-up from the Los Angeles fires, however, is unprecedented and the largest in US history. LA County closed beaches along a nine-mile (14 km) stretch for weeks following the fires in January. Then torrential rain - while helping douse any smouldering embers - caused mudslides in the burn area and runoff of toxic ash and chemicals into the ocean, prompting further closures. Now most beaches are reopened but a water advisory remains in effect along the coast from Santa Monica to Malibu until further notice advising ""beach goers may recreate on the sand but continue to be advised to stay away from visible fire debris and to stay out of the ocean water during any posted ocean advisory"". Only the most dedicated and local surfers could access the beaches in the burn area anyway - there's no parking or stopping for about 9 miles along Pacific Coast Highway, which is clogged with trucks and workers cleaning up debris. Though some will risk most anything to catch a good wave. While touring the EPA sorting site, Annelisa Moe said she saw two surfers in the water at a popular surf break on Topanga Beach while she watched workers across the street in full PPE handling burned EV car batteries. ""The water looked like chocolate milk with like brown foam on it,"" recalled Ms Moe, who is the associate director of Science & Policy, Water Quality at Heal the Bay, an environmental nonprofit dedicated to making coastal watersheds healthy. ""It was one of those days, in between storms, like beautiful, sunny, 75 degree weather type of days,"" she said. ""And so it felt a little bit odd to be there amidst the destruction while we have this perfect beach day."" Jenny Newman of the Los Angeles regional water quality control board told an LA County Public Health virtual town hall on 18 February that the initial water quality tests they conducted on 22-27 January ""came back better than we expected."" But the water board cautioned that people should follow county advisories to stay out of the water near the burn site. Dozens of scientists and volunteers from Heal The Bay and a myriad of private and public sector agencies have also been testing water and soil samples to see what levels of forever chemicals and heavy metals are present in the ocean, but toxic analysis can take 4-6 weeks and there's very little data available. At the Surfrider Foundation, volunteers test the ocean water all year long. But their small lab is testing for fecal bacteria - not arsenic. Now it's too dangerous to expose volunteers in the burn areas, so the staff have partnered with Heal the Bay and the University of Southern California to process their water samples. ""All our community members are ocean lovers. We have the same questions they have,"" said Eugenia Ermacora of the Surfrider Foundation. ""It's a concern, and everybody is asking, When can we go back? When is it safe? And I wish I had an answer."" Chad White, a surfer who grew up in the Palisades and who protested against the EPA sorting site along the Pacific Coast Highway, said there's no way he would surf there now - it would be too painful to look at the coast and be reminded of what has been lost. And there's too much metal and other debris in the surf. ""It's taken my desire to surf down to zero, not just because of the water quality, but just because of what's happening,"" he said over coffee in Topanga Canyon. He rode his first wave in 1977 at Will Rogers State Beach and taught his son to surf at age four and his wife at age 60. ""It's earth-shattering to someone like me,"" he said of the destruction along the coast. ""That beach means something to me too, and I'm one person. There are tens of, maybe hundreds or thousands of us that utilize the beach every day."" Many of Mr White's friends lost their homes and he said people are traumatised to see what the landscape and coast around them looks like now. ""Every movie that you see, every film that makes anybody from any other part of the world want to come to California is based on their seeing that Pacific Coast Highway and those beautiful homes in Malibu, across along the beach. They're all gone,"" he said. ""Now it's a toxic waste dump."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crlx8w5wdl0o,Has Trump kept his day one promises?,2025-02-23T00:01:52.097Z,Anthony Zurcher and Tom Geoghegan,"Donald Trump made a lot of promises while running for president. He pledged to cut taxes, reduce prices, stem undocumented migration, end wars and strengthen American industry. Some of his proposals were detailed by his policy team or presented by Trump himself, in ""Agenda 47"" videos on his campaign website. Others were offered seemingly off-the-cuff - a product of Trump's ""think out loud"" style and openness to adopting ideas others had suggested to him. In his victory speech on 6 November, he made it clear he intended to keep the promises that sent him back to the White House: ""I will govern by a simple motto: Promises made, promises kept."" It's become a slogan of sorts in his first month in office, which has been marked by a blizzard of activity and notable progress in achieving some of his goals. In areas such as immigration and foreign policy, Trump has broad power to act unilaterally - and has done so. In other areas, he has run up against legal challenges and political obstacles. Many of the other promises he's made will ultimately require action from Congress, under narrow Republican control, to become permanent. Here's a look at some of Trump's biggest ""day one"" promises and his efforts to turn them into reality. What he's said: ""When I win, I will immediately bring prices down, starting on day one."" Aug 2024 What he's done: This is perhaps his biggest challenge and a major campaign promise that remains undelivered. In his inaugural address, Trump promised to ""marshal the vast powers"" of his Cabinet to rapidly bring down costs and prices, but it's unclear how. One way, he says, is by increasing drilling to reduce energy costs. A steep price rise in January, the biggest monthly increase for 16 months, has complicated Trump's task. He blamed Joe Biden, who left office on 20 January, and Democratic spending. ""I had nothing to do with it,"" said Trump. At other times, however, he has admitted it's hard for US presidents to control prices. But economists warn some of his policies could fuel inflation and polling suggests voters would like to see him doing more about an issue that often tops their priorities. What he's said: ""On day one, I will launch the largest deportation program in American history to get the criminals out."" Nov 2024 What he's done: Immigration has perhaps been Trump's main focus since taking power, with more than a dozen executive orders aimed at overhauling the system. His plan to deport foreign nationals in the country illegally, starting with those convicted of crimes, seems to have widespread public support. But it is uncertain whether he will meet his promise to deport so many. A few raids have made headlines but the number of people being removed does not seem to be record-breaking, according to the daily figures. In his first month in office, the US deported 37,660 people - less than the monthly average of 57,000 removals and returns in the last full year of Joe Biden's administration, data obtained by Reuters shows. A DHS spokesperson told the agency that Biden-era deportation numbers were higher because illegal immigration was higher. Nationwide border encounters decreased 66% in January compared to 2024, according to the White House. What he's said: ""I'll be looking at J6 early on, maybe the first nine minutes."" Dec 2024 What he's done: True to his word, hours after taking the presidential oath, Trump issued pardons and commutations that paved the way for the release of more than 1,500 people convicted or charged in connection with the US Capitol riot. A police officer who was punched that day told the BBC the pardons were a ""slap in the face"". What he's said: ""They're dying, Russians and Ukrainians. I want them to stop dying. And I'll have that done - I'll have that done in 24 hours."" May 2023 What he's done: Trump has initiated the first talks between the US and Russia since the start of the war, but Ukraine has vowed to reject any deal hatched without it, and there's been an angry exchange between leaders. President Volodymyr Zelensky fears the US president delivering on his campaign promise to end the war but on Moscow's terms and with no security guarantees. There is also anxiety in European capitals that they are being sidelined, and that Trump may dismantle some of the sanctions imposed on Russia as punishment for the invasion. What he's said: Trump told NBC in December he ""absolutely"" planned to end birthright citizenship on day one: ""If somebody sets a foot of just a foot… on our land, congratulations. You are now a citizen of the United States of America. Yes, we're going to end that."" What he's done: In one of the first acts of his second presidency, Trump ordered an end to an automatic right to American citizenship currently received by nearly anybody born on US soil. Birthright citizenship is not the norm around the world, although it is in Mexico and Canada, and Trump's move targets those who are in the US illegally or on temporary visas. The right was established by an amendment to the US Constitution nearly 160 years ago, and most legal scholars say the president doesn't have the power to unilaterally change it. The issue could be heading for the US Supreme Court after an appeals court ruled against Trump, upholding a legal block on his plan. What he's said: ""On January 20th, as one of my many first Executive Orders, I will sign all necessary documents to charge Mexico and Canada a 25% Tariff on ALL products coming into the United States, and its ridiculous Open Borders."" Nov 2024 What he's done: Trump announced on 21 January that he would levy blanket tariffs on his neighbours on 1 February, linking them to the flow of drugs and migrants into the US. The president has long seen tariffs, which are a tax on imports, as a way to protect domestic industry and increase revenue. Canada and Mexico said they would enact retaliatory taxes on US imports. But Trump delayed starting the tariffs for one month, after promises by both countries to increase border enforcement. There had also been volatility in the markets and warnings from economic experts that these actions could cause prices to rise. "
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8yvg5359po,US measles outbreak leaves nearly 100 ill in Texas and New Mexico,2025-02-22T23:24:18.938Z,Laura Blasey,"Health officials in two US states are tracking measles outbreaks as cases rise to nearly 100 people. The Texas Department of State Health Services reported on Friday that it was aware of 90 cases diagnosed in the last month in the South Plains area, in the north-west part of the state. At least 77 of them were reported in children and teens under 17. In New Mexico, officials said nine people had become sick in Lea County, along the state's eastern border with Texas. Measles is highly contagious and can be deadly. The outbreaks come amid a rise in US anti-vaccine sentiment, including towards the measles, mumps and rubella (MMR) jab that is typically given during childhood. Health officials in Texas say their figures are likely to be an underestimate, as some parents may not report infections or may not realise their child has the disease. ""It is troubling, because this was completely preventable,"" Dr Amesh Adalja, an infectious disease physician and senior scholar at Johns Hopkins University, told CBS News, the BBC's US news partner. ""It's the most contagious infectious disease known to humans,"" he added. Symptoms of the highly-infectious illness include fever, cough, runny nose, eye irritation and a rash. A measles infection can have particularly devastating complications for pregnant women and young children, including pneumonia, neurological impairment, hearing loss and death. Survivors are at risk of developing a degenerative brain and nervous system disease known as subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE). Most US children receive two shots to protect against the illness, which together are 97% effective in protecting against measles, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Health experts say that the disease could be controlled or even eradicated with proper inoculation rates - generally defined as 95% of a community receiving the vaccine. But vaccination rates have dropped in some communities in recent decades as a loose network of vaccine sceptics have, without evidence, questioned the safety and efficacy of the shots. Robert F Kennedy Jr, recently confirmed as US President Donald Trump's health secretary, has faced strong criticism for his ties to these groups. Most states require that children receive the MMR vaccine to attend school, but many, including Texas, also allow families to file a conscientious exemption - a non-medical reason to refuse a vaccine requirement. In Texas, federal data shows that the state achieved a 94.3% vaccination rate among kindergarteners for the 2023-2024 school year, while New Mexico reached 95%. But a state survey of Texas schools found that rates of exemptions were ticking upwards for MMR and other required vaccines. In Gaines County, where 57 of the Texas cases were reported, exemptions have surged over the last decade. State data shows 17.62% of students had a conscientious exemption to at least one required vaccine during the 2023-2024 school year, up from 7.45% in the 2013-2014 year. Neighbouring Terry County, home to 20 cases, saw exemption rates go from zero to 3.73% in the same time period. Texas officials reported that of the 90 cases in their state, 85 were in people who are unvaccinated or whose vaccination status was unclear. CBS reports that the area is home to a large Mennonite community, which typically have low vaccination rates due to the group's religious beliefs. Some officials are reluctant to intervene. ""We respect everyone's right to vaccinate or not get vaccinated,"" Albert Pilkington, CEO of the nearby Seminole Hospital District, told the Texas Standard. ""That's just what it means to be an American, right?"" US children have been vaccinated against measles since 1963. The jab was improved and combined with vaccines for the mumps and rubella viruses about a decade later, and is widely considered to be safe. Prior to the vaccine's introduction, around 48,000 people were hospitalized with measles each year and 400–500 people died. In 2024, the US reported 285 cases with 114 hospitalisations. Health officials in New Mexico are offering a free vaccine clinic this week in an effort to boost protection. Texas also directed residents to contact their doctors or visit a clinic to get vaccinated if they have not previously received a shot."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8mdrvnmkno,California asks US government for billions in fire relief funds,2025-02-22T18:28:54.195Z,Ana Faguy,"California Governor Gavin Newsom has asked the US federal government for $40 billion (£31.6b) in funds to help rebuild areas of Los Angeles devastated by January fires. Newsom sent the request to congressional leaders in a letter on Friday. He said the funds would help both immediate and long-term recovery work. ""I'm asking Congress to have the back of the American people and provide disaster funding to help Californians recover and rebuild as soon as possible,"" he wrote on social media. The fires, which began 7 January, burned 37,469 acres and killed at least 26 people in the greater Los Angeles area. The funds would be used for workforce recovery, tax incentives, wildfire resilience and private property redevelopment, Newsom said. Under Newsom's proposal, the largest share of the funds - 42% - would go to public assistance in debris removal and repair work. ""The impacted communities have experienced widespread devastation and the total impact on California's economy will take years to fully qualify,"" Newsom wrote in the letter. Some 150,000 residents have been displaced since the fires broke out in early January. Much of the Los Angeles area communities of the Pacific Palisades and Altadena were destroyed during the days of blazes. The request drew support from some lawmakers who represent the area. ""This package will provide an injection of desperately needed federal aid for rebuilding homes, businesses, and community institutions, which will support the healing process for Angelenos suffering the grief and trauma of losing loved ones, homes, and every belonging they cherished,"" Judy Chu, a Democratic congresswoman, said in a statement. It's not clear how the request will be received in Congress, where both chambers are controlled by Republicans with narrow majorities. Last month, ahead of his visit to Los Angeles, President Donald Trump told Fox News he did not think the federal government should give California ""anything"" until it shifted water supply to the south of the state. Following his visit to the Palisades, Trump described the destruction as ""devastation"". ""I don't think you can realize how rough it is, how devastating is until you see it,"" Trump said. ""I mean, I saw a lot of bad things on television, but the extent of it, the size of it, we flew over it in a helicopter."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyr2xvn4dpo,Trump fires top US general CQ Brown in shake-up at Pentagon,2025-02-22T07:06:13.780Z,Rachel Looker,"US President Donald Trump has fired the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff CQ Brown, the highest-ranking officer in the country, as part of a major shake-up of top military leadership. ""I want to thank General Charles 'CQ' Brown for his over 40 years of service to our country,"" Trump posted on social media. He said five other top officers were also being replaced. Gen Brown was the second black officer to hold the post, the holder of which advises both the president and the secretary of defence on national security. US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth had previously said that Gen Brown should be fired because of his ""woke"" focus on diversity, equity and inclusion programmes in the military. Later on Friday, Hegseth announced the firings of two additional senior officers: Chief of Naval Operations Adm Lisa Franchetti and Vice Chief of Staff of the Air Force Gen Jim Slife. Adm Franchetti was the first woman to lead the US Navy. All three top officers removed on Friday were appointed by Trump's predecessor, Joe Biden. Hegseth said in a statement: ""Under President Trump, we are putting in place new leadership that will focus our military on its core mission of deterring, fighting and winning wars."" Trump said he would nominate Air Force Lt Gen Dan Caine - a career F-16 pilot who most recently served as CIA associate director for military affairs - as the new chairman of the joint chiefs of staff. Last year, at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump recalled first meeting Gen Caine in Iraq. ""He looked better than any movie actor you could get,"" Trump told the audience. In the same speech, he praised the US military but said it was ""woke at the top"". Gen Brown had been visiting troops at the southern US border on Friday, roughly two hours before Trump's post announcing his departure. Rumours had been swirling this week that the president would remove the commander, whose term was set to expire in 2027. Gen Brown made headlines in 2020 when he spoke out about race following the death of George Floyd. He posted a video message to the US Air Force describing the pressures he had felt as one of the few black men in his unit, including being questioned about his credentials. In 2022, while chief of staff of the air force, Gen Brown co-signed a memo setting out diversity goals to boost the proportion of minority officer applicants while adjusting lower the rate of white candidates, according to the Air Force Times. Colin Powell was the first black chairman of the joint chiefs of staff, serving from 1989-93. One of Trump's first acts after being sworn in last month was to fire the first female commandant of the Coast Guard, citing ""excessive focus"" on diversity. In November, before he was confirmed, Hegseth said on a podcast that there were many problems in the military, including diversity initiatives, which the Trump administration should ""course correct"". ""First of all, you got to fire the chairman of joint chiefs,"" Hegseth said in describing the steps he believed Trump should take. The Pentagon also announced on Friday that it would cut its budget and let go of 5,400 probationary employees next week. Meanwhile, a federal court in Maryland temporarily blocked Trump from implementing bans on diversity, equity and inclusion programmes. District Judge Adam Abelson ruled that the directives by Trump may violate free-speech rights in the US constitution."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93np4y0343o,19 things Trump and his team did this week,2025-02-22T03:36:13.867Z,Emily McGarvey,"Donald Trump has been back in the White House for a month. His fifth week in office saw more dramatic moves as the president continued on his plan to remake the federal government, implement sweeping cuts and reshape American foreign policy. This week he called Ukraine's war-time president a ""dictator"", pledged to make IVF more affordable and dismissed his highest-ranking military officer. If you're after a catch-up, here is a reminder of 19 major moves from the Trump administration this week. Trump on Tuesday called Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky a ""dictator"" - part of a heated back and forth between the two leaders that also saw the US president appear to blame Ukraine for Russia's invasion. His attacks came after Zelensky reacted to US-Russia talks about the war, from which Kyiv was excluded. Zelensky said Trump was ""living in a disinformation space"" governed by Moscow after Trump said the Ukrainian leader was down to 4% approval rating among the Ukrainian public - a figure Zelensky said was being spread by Russia. Zelensky's term was due to come to an end in May 2024 but his country has been under martial law since Russia launched its full-scale invasion three years ago, and elections are suspended. The ""dictator"" line prompted criticism from European leaders including German Chancellor Olaf Scholz, who said it was ""simply wrong and dangerous"". On Tuesday, US and Russian officials held their first high-level, face-to-face talks since the war started but Ukraine was not invited. Top US officials met Moscow counterparts in Saudi Arabia, prompting fears in Kyiv that the country invaded by Russia was being sidelined. On Friday, he told Fox News it was not important for Zelensky to be at peace talks but he would ""of course"" take a call from him. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio said talks with Russia were a first step towards negotiating a peace deal and nothing would be imposed on Ukraine. Russian authorities released a US national who was arrested at a Moscow airport this month for cannabis possession. Kalob Byers, 28, was freed hours before the talks between US and Russian officials over the war in Ukraine were set to begin. The US also said it will release a Russian national - Alexander Vinnik, who was arrested in 2017 on charges related to the laundering of billions of dollars using virtual currency Bitcoin - as part of a prisoner exchange that brought home American schoolteacher Marc Fogel last week. The Trump administration is moving to end New York City's congestion pricing plan, which charges vehicles entering the city in certain areas, then uses tolls to upgrade its aging transit systems. It was launched last month. ""CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD,"" Trump said on social media. ""Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!"" In response, New York Govenor Kathy Hochul said: ""We are a nation of laws, not ruled by a king. We'll see you in court."" Four women who allege they were sexually abused by the social media influencer Andrew Tate said they were ""extremely concerned"" by reports that US officials had asked Romania to relax travel restrictions against Tate and his brother, Tristan Tate, who have dual UK-US nationality. The Financial Times newspaper first reported that US officials had brought up the case with the Romanian government last week, and it was then followed up by Trump's envoy Richard Grenell at the weekend. One source told the paper that a request had been made by the US to return the brothers' passports to them so they could travel while waiting for the criminal case against them to finish. The US State Department has been approached by the BBC for comment. The US Border Patrol said there was a decrease in migrants illegally crossing the US-Mexico border in January. It recorded 29,000 arrests - the lowest since May 2020 and down from 47,000 in December, according to department figures. Trump took office on 20 January, replacing predecessor Joe Biden. The Trump administration has promised to clamp down on undocumented migration into the US, which has also included declaring an emergency at the southern border and expanded processes that allow for rapid expulsions. Trump reassigned the acting director of Immigration and Customs Enforcement this week, US media reported. The move came after Trump and border tsar Tom Homan expressed anger that deportation numbers weren't higher. The Trump administration - and his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) leader Elon Musk - are continuing a cost-cutting drive that aims to drastically reduce the federal workforce. More than 6,000 Internal Revenue Service (IRS) employees are expected to be fired, and on Friday the Pentagon said it planned to ""release"" 5,400 probationary workers starting early next week. Around 1,000 employees in the US National Park Service were let go last weekend - roughly 5% of the workforce - according to CBS News. It has also begun firing hundreds of Federal Aviation Administration employees, and the head of Professional Aviation Safety Specialists union David Spero called the firings ""shameful"". Polling suggests there is public support for less government spending but also concern that Musk's efficiency drive could go too far. Trump's administration is attempting to rehire officials with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) who worked on the government response to bird flu before being fired over the weekend, US media report. The terminations came as the latest outbreak of the bird flu has wreaked havoc on poultry and cattle farms, causing egg prices to skyrocket. A USDA spokesperson told the BBC that although ""several"" officials working on bird flu were ""notified of their terminations"" over the weekend, ""we are working to swiftly rectify the situation and rescind those letters"". It's not the first time this has happened - after firing officials with the National Nuclear Security Administration last week, US media reported that the government was trying to reinstate some, but was struggling to contact them. Trump has signed an executive order that will examine ways to make in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) treatments more affordable. Speaking at an event at Mar-a-Lago, White House staff secretary Will Scharf said the order asks that the Domestic Policy Council make recommendations within 90 days to protect access to IVF and ""aggressively"" reduce its costs. During his campaigning, Trump said that IVF treatments would be paid for by insurance companies or the government if he returned to the White House. A row erupted between the White House and the Associated Press (AP) - a global media organisation - after Google Maps changed the Gulf of Mexico's name to the Gulf of America for people using the app in the US. Trump has ordered the body of water to be renamed in US government documents. The AP says that it will not change the name of the Gulf of Mexico in its style guide, which is used by many US media outlets. Trump said on Tuesday that he will block AP from the Oval Office and Air Force One until it stops referring to the Gulf of Mexico. The media organisation sued three Trump officials in response, US media reported on Friday. The AP argues Trump's ban violates the First Amendment and is seeking an emergency hearing to declare Trump's moves unconstitutional. US justice department lawyers on Wednesday defended their decision to end a criminal case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams. Last week, the Department of Justice filed a motion to dismiss fraud and bribery charges against Adams. Seven justice department lawyers, including the top US prosecutor in Manhattan, resigned over an order to drop the case. Adams was indicted last year on the charges. He denies any wrongdoing. Trump has denied that he had any involvement in asking prosecutors to dismiss the Adams case. On Friday, a judge paused Adams' trial and ordered an outside lawyer to advise him by coming up with arguments against dropping the charges - essentially creating a legal test. On Wednesday, Trump signed an executive order ending federal benefits for undocumented migrants. The measure will seek to ensure that any federal funds to states and localities ""will not be used to support sanctuary policies or assist illegal immigration"", according to the White House. The Trump administration also suspended a service on Tuesday that helped children who come to the US without a parent or guardian to navigate the immigration court system. Trump said he is considering using a percentage of the potential savings from Elon Musk's taskforce to send payments directly to US taxpayers. ""We're thinking about giving 20% back to the American citizens and 20% back to pay down debt,"" Trump said in Florida this week, without giving further details. Before making the remarks, Musk had posted on his social media platform X that he ""will check with the President"" after a user suggested the pair should announce a ""DOGE Dividend"". During his speech at the Munich Security Conference a week ago, US Vice-President JD Vance launched a scalding attack on European democracies saying the greatest threat facing the continent was not from Russia and China, but ""from within"". Vance was expected to address possible talks to end the war in Ukraine but instead accused European governments - including the UK's - of retreating from their values, and ignoring voter concerns on migration and free speech. The speech was denounced by several politicians at the conference. Rubio boycotted a meeting of G20 foreign ministers in South Africa this week, and Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said he will not attend next week's gathering of G20 finance ministers. South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa told the meeting that a commitment to multilateralism and international law is vital to solving global crises. Announcing his refusal to attend, Rubio said South Africa was ""using G20 to promote 'solidarity, equality, & sustainability.' In other words: DEI [diversity, equity and inclusion] and climate change"". Bessent said he had other commitments in Washington. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has told US military services to identify $50bn in cuts next year so the money can be used elsewhere for Trump's priorities. The deputy defence secretary said in a statement on Wednesday that ""excessive bureaucracy"" and ""unnecessary spending that set our military back under the previous administration, including through so-called 'climate change' and other woke programs"" would end. Late Friday night, Trump announced on Truth Social, his social media platform, that the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff was leaving, as well. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has restored funding for 9/11-related cancer research after Doge attempted to cancel it last week, according to officials. The $257,000 (£199,000) contract goes towards data processing to compare cancer incidence rates among firefighters exposed to the World Trade Center toxins with firefighters who were not. Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer said: ""9/11 cancer research and funding for FDNY should have never been on the chopping block"". Trump's motorcade drove round the Daytona racetrack in the opening event of the season's Nascar series. The president's Air Force One jet gave a flyby for spectators before he met the drivers and led them for a lap around the circuit. US Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff CQ Brown was fired as the highest-ranking military officer in the country, responsible for advising the president and defence secretary. On Friday evening, Trump took to social media to announce the departure of Gen Brown, who was the second black officer in US history to hold the post. The president said five other top officers were being replaced. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth had previously said Gen Brown should be fired because of his ""woke"" focus on diversity, equity and inclusion programmes in the military."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0mlm7zdlo,Trump says Starmer and Macron 'haven't done anything' to end Ukraine war,2025-02-22T03:30:38.578Z,Max Matza,"US President Donald Trump has said French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer ""haven't done anything"" to end the war in Ukraine, ahead of their visits to the White House next week. Trump also said Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky had ""no cards"" in peace negotiations, adding: ""I don't think he's very important to be in meetings."" Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022, the UK, France and other allies have been supplying Kyiv with weapons and other aid. On Monday, European leaders held a hastily-arranged summit in Paris - a day before US-Russia talks in Saudi Arabia, and amid fears that Ukraine and Europe could be excluded from peace negotiations. Despite his criticism of Macron and Sir Keir, Trump also praised the European leaders in his interview with Fox News. He said that he considered Macron to be a ""friend"", and called the British prime minister a ""very nice guy"". Macron is expected to visit Washington on Monday, while Sir Keir will be there on Thursday. Earlier this week, the British prime minister said he was ""ready and willing"" to put UK troops on the ground in Ukraine to help guarantee its security as part of a peace deal. The BBC has contacted the PM's office for comment. While European leaders have ruled out negotiating with Russia, they have met regularly to discuss the war in Ukraine. Since Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the US, UK and EU - along with other countries including Australia, Canada and Japan - have imposed more than 20,000 sanctions on Russia. Many European nations have also signed agreements to support and provide aid to Ukraine. In January, Sir Keir signed a ""landmark"" pact, telling Zelensky: ""We are with you not just today, for this year or the next - but for 100 years - long after this terrible war is over and Ukraine is free and thriving once again."" Keith Kellogg, Trump's Ukraine envoy, said he had had ""extensive and positive"" discussions with Zelensky during their meeting in Kyiv on Thursday. Kellogg praised Zelensky as a ""courageous leader"" - only days after Trump referred to him as a ""dictator"". In recent days, Zelensky has held phone calls with various global leaders, who have expressed their commitment to ensuring Ukraine is involved in peace talks. Trump said on Friday that Russia and Ukraine would not want to begin peace talks without his own personal involvement. He also continued to criticise Zelensky, saying: ""I've been watching this man for years now as his cities get demolished, as his people get killed, as his soldiers get decimated. ""I've been watching him negotiate with no cards. He has no cards, and you get sick of it. You just get sick of it, and I've had it."" After criticising Zelensky over the past week - using talking points that analysts say sound more like they originate in Moscow than Washington - Trump offered that ""of course"" he would take a phone call from Ukraine's president. He insisted several times that Zelensky was to blame for failing to prevent the war, saying that Russia could have been ""talked out"" of invading Ukraine. Asked about Ukraine's absence from peace talks in Saudi Arabia this week, Trump said that Russia ""found it impossible to make a deal with Zelensky"". He said he believed that Russia sincerely wanted a deal to end the war, but that President Vladimir Putin ""doesn't have to make a deal"". US Vice-President JD Vance later hit back at critics who said that Trump's stance on Russia amounted to ""appeasement"". ""We are negotiating to end the conflict. It is 'appeasement' only if you think the Ukrainians have a credible pathway to victory. They don't, so it's not,"" he said in a post on X. Meanwhile, Kyiv and Washington appeared to be inching closer to signing a deal that would give the US rights to Ukraine's deposits of rare earth minerals. Trump has styled this as a way for Ukraine to repay the US for its past military support. He told reporters on Friday that the US and Ukraine were ""pretty close"" to signing the deal, adding that the US would ""get our money back"". In a video address late on Friday, Zelensky said Ukrainian and US teams were working on a draft agreement, which ""can add value to our relations"". But he stressed that ""what matters most is getting the details right"". The Ukrainian president had rejected the initial US proposal made several days ago, saying he ""cannot sell our state"". White House Security Advisor Mike Waltz said on Friday that Zelensky was ""going to sign that deal""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4klq45ngvo,Trans Euphoria star says new passport lists her as male,2025-02-22T01:59:18.120Z,Rachel Looker,"Hunter Schafer, a transgender woman and star of hit HBO teen drama Euphoria, has said a new US passport lists her as male, despite selecting female when she filled out the paperwork. ""I was shocked,"" Schafer said in a TikTok video showing the ""M"" marker on her new travel document. Her previous passport listed her as female. ""I just didn't think it was actually going to happen,"" the 26-year-old added, criticising US President Donald Trump's policies on gender. On his first day in office, Trump signed an executive order recognising only two sexes and declaring they cannot be changed. The US now issues passports with just male or female designations, based on a person's sex recorded at birth. Previously, Americans could select their gender for passports and also request to be listed as ""X"", which the Biden administration said in 2022 was being offered as an option ""for non-binary, intersex and gender non-confirming individuals"". Schafer said she had applied for a new passport after losing her old one while filming overseas. She filled out forms indicating she was female, but when she picked up her replacement, it listed her as male, according to her post. Schafer said she intended to travel abroad next week and anticipated challenges at the airport because of the new passport. She said she believed it was ""a direct result of the administration our country is currently operating under"". Trump's executive order says of the male and female sexes that they ""are not changeable and are grounded in fundamental and incontrovertible reality"". It adds: ""'Sex' is not a synonym for and does not include the concept of 'gender identity'."" The US state department, which issues passports, says on its website that it will ""only issue passports with an M or F sex marker that match the customer's biological sex at birth"". After learning about Trump's executive order, Schafer said her first reaction was: ""I'll believe it when I see it."" ""Today I saw it,"" she told fans. Schafer added: ""I just feel like it's important to share that it's not just talk - that this is real and it's happening and no-one - no matter their circumstance, no matter how wealthy or white or pretty or whatever - is excluded."" The Euphoria star said she changed her gender markers for her driver's licence and passports when she was a teenager, but that her birth certificate was never amended. ""I'm pretty sure it's going to come along with having to out myself to border patrol agents and that whole gig, much more often than I would like to or is really necessary,"" she said. On the HBO drama, now in its third season, she plays a transgender teenager, Jules Vaughn, who has a complicated relationship with the main character Rue."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75762x20kro,Trump administration to cut thousands of jobs at Pentagon and IRS,2025-02-22T00:47:32.362Z,Kayla Epstein,"The Trump administration is cutting more than 11,000 jobs at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Pentagon, as part of its sweeping efforts to shrink the size of the federal workforce. Around 6,000 layoffs at the IRS began on Thursday, coming in the middle of tax season as millions of Americans file their returns. The defence department plans to axe more than 5,000 jobs next week as part of a goal to reduce its nearly million-strong civilian workforce by 5 to 8%, the Pentagon said on Friday. It will also put a hiring freeze in place. The Trump administration has appointed Elon Musk's Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) to implement the layoffs as part of a cost-cutting drive. The probationary workers who are expected to lose their jobs at the IRS ""were not deemed as critical to filing season"", according to an email seen by CBS News, the BBC's US partner. Most Americans have a deadline of 15 April to file their taxes, though the government allows extensions under some circumstances. Probationary employees are generally those on the job for less than a year. A person who has been a long-serving employee but moved to a new position is also often considered in a probationary position. The BBC has contacted the IRS and treasury department for comment. Reports suggest the terminations will target mostly new and newly promoted employees, with half of the cuts hitting an office known as the Small Business/Self-Employed (SBSE) Division. The email from SBSE commissioner Lia Colbert says that ""while details are still developing, we understand that over 3,500 SB/SE probationary hires will be terminated by the end of this week"". About 83,000 people worked for the IRS as of the 2023 fiscal year. Many of the targeted roles appear to deal with compliance matters, or ensuring Americans pay what the government says they owe. Linda Bilmes, a professor at the Harvard Kennedy School, told the BBC: ""What people like even less than paying taxes is not being able to reach someone to help them pay their taxes accurately."" The Biden administration had secured $80bn (£63bn) in funding for new resources and staff at the IRS, to help the government bring in more revenue. Republicans, who generally advocate for lower taxes, opposed the effort and have long targeted the IRS for funding cuts. In an interview on Fox News, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick said Trump's ""goal is to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and let all the outsiders pay"". The president has proposed an ""External Revenue Service"" to generate funds from tariffs, or taxes on foreign imports, instead. The firings at the Pentagon were expected to initially affect about 5,400 probationary workers beginning next week before freezing hiring, a defence department statement said. But these job losses might not be the last. ""We anticipate reducing the Department's civilian workforce by 5-8% to produce efficiencies and refocus the Department on the President's priorities and restoring readiness in the force,"" the statement added. The defence department is the largest government agency, with a civilian workforce of about 950,000 employees, according to Reuters. Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has supported these cuts, posting on X last week that the Pentagon needs ""to cut the fat (HQ) and grow the muscle (warfighters)"". Polling indicates some discomfort among Americans for Trump's changes to the federal workforce. A Washington Post/Ipsos poll suggests that 54% of Americans disapproved of the way Trump is managing the federal government, compared to 44% who approved."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ym8n4lzp6o,Are planes crashing more often?,2025-02-22T00:44:15.751Z,"Joshua Cheetham, Yi Ma & Matt Murphy","After a series of high-profile disasters, some social media users suggested that air travel accidents were becoming more frequent. Videos of hair-raising near misses began to trend online and the US Transport Secretary Sean Duffy sought to calm fears in an interview with the BBC's US partner, CBS News. He told viewers that the recent spate of air disasters in America were ""very unique"". Duffy's intervention came after several serious incidents, including a mid-air collision in January between a commercial airliner and a military helicopter in Washington DC, in which 67 people died. Footage of a plane flipping over after landing in poor weather in Toronto, Canada, has also been widely shared online, further fuelling alarm. And while polling on the subject is limited, one recent Associated Press survey suggested these startling images of accidents have had some impact on some US consumers' confidence in flying. But BBC Verify has analysed data in the US and worldwide and found that over the past two decades there has been a general downward trend in air accidents. For the US, figures on air accidents have been compiled by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) up to the end of January this year. This NTSB data shows a general fall in air accidents in the US from 2005 to 2024 despite a significant increase in the overall number of flights over this period. It also shows that the figure for January 2025 (52), was lower than it was in January last year (58) and January 2023 (70). Data from International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), a UN body which monitors global air incidents, shows that the number of worldwide accidents per million plane departures has also seen a clear downward trend between 2005 and 2023. The ICAO definition of an aircraft accident is very broad and not only includes those in which passengers or crew are seriously injured or die, but also incidents where an aircraft is damaged and needs repairs, or goes missing. Data on the number of deaths in air accidents globally also shows that there has been a decrease over the same period, albeit with spikes in some years reflecting major air disasters. In 2014, two such events contributed to a significant spike. In March, Malaysian Airlines flight MH370 disappeared as it travelled from Kuala Lumpur to Beijing with 239 people on board. In July, another Malaysian Airlines plane, MH17, was shot down by a Russian-made missile over eastern Ukraine, killing almost 300. Data sets such as this are inclined to see sudden, large fluctuations, Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, Emeritus Professor of Statistics at the University of Cambridge, told BBC Verify. ""If you count fatalities rather than accidents it's bound to be extremely volatile and sensitive to a single large accident,"" he said. ""Random events do not occur evenly - they tend to cluster. So unfortunately we can expect aircraft accidents to be appear to be connected, even when they are not."" Regarding the series of high-profile accidents over the past few months, Ismo Aaltonen, formerly Finland's chief air disaster investigator, told BBC Verify they are not an indication of a decline in aircraft safety. ""It's very unlucky that we had this period of many different kind of accidents, but people should not draw any conclusions based on this because they are such different cases,"" he said. He noted that some incidents over the past few months were unforeseeable, citing an Azerbaijan Airlines flight which crashed in Kazakhstan in December after being targeted by a Russian anti-aircraft missile. Marco Chan, a former pilot and senior lecturer at Buckinghamshire New University, told BBC Verify that the rise in awareness of air disasters is being further fuelled because ""accidents are getting increasing exposure from social media platforms"". One video circulating on TikTok - which has been pulled from a Superman film - shows the hero preventing a jet from smashing into a stadium. Accompanying the clip is the caption: ""Pete Buttigieg every single day the last four years, judging by current events."" The viral clip suggests that aviation disasters have grown since the ex-US transportation secretary left office in January. A string of incidents in recent years involving the Boeing 737 Max aircraft has also attracted significant attention in the media and on social media, especially after a door blew out mid-flight in January 2024. Concerns over that and several other incidents saw some customers boycott planes manufactured by Boeing and a collapse in the company's share price. Experts told BBC Verify that incidents such as these and major crashes are thoroughly investigated by authorities. New details and data from accidents are fed into pilot training simulators so that they can prepare for similar scenarios in the future. ""If you look at simulators today, how advanced they are, they are like real aircraft,"" said Ismo Aaltonen. ""It's completely different to when I started flying more than 40 years ago."" Regulators can also impose penalties for safety violations which include fines, license suspensions and operational restrictions. Airlines can also be banned from countries and blocs if they don't adhere to safety standards. Despite the recent spate of incidents, air travel remains by far the safest form of travel. Of all transport-related deaths in 2022 in the US, over 95% occurred on the road, according to the latest available figures from the US Department of Transportation. Fewer than 1% were related to air travel. And if you look at the figures in terms of fatalities per distance travelled, the comparative safety of air travel is even clearer. In 2022, there were just 0.001 passenger deaths per 100,000,000 miles onboard airlines, compared with 0.54 in passenger vehicles, according to the most recent figures from the National Safety Council, a US-based non-profit organisation. ""Be careful how you make your trip to the airport"" said Mr Aaltonen. ""That's the most dangerous part of the trip compared to the actual flight."" What do you want BBC Verify to investigate?"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2glydm3gmo,"French far-right leader cancels speech, accusing Bannon of 'Nazi' gesture",2025-02-21T23:06:11.217Z,Brandon Drenon,"French far-right leader Jordan Bardella has cancelled a planned speech in the US, after President Donald Trump's former top adviser made a hand gesture that some likened to a Nazi salute. Steve Bannon yelled ""fight, fight, fight"" before extending his right arm, fingers pointed and palm down, during his speech at the Conservative Political Action Conference (Cpac) near Washington DC on Thursday evening. Bardella, who leads France's National Rally party, was scheduled to speak at the event on Friday. He said in a statement that he was cancelling his appearance over what he called a ""gesture referring to Nazi ideology"". Bannon denied the Nazi comparison and called the gesture a ""wave"", saying it was the ""exact same wave"" he did on stage at a speech seven years ago in France to Bardella's party. ""If he cancelled [the speech] over what the mainstream media said about the speech, he didn't listen to the speech. If that's true, he's unworthy to lead France. He's a boy, not a man,"" Bannon told the French news magazine Le Point. Inside the halls of the suburban convention centre hosting Cpac, Romanian far-right leader George Simion also disagreed with Bardella's interpretation of Bannon's hand gesture. ""Any historian knows that wasn't a Nazi salute,"" he told the BBC. Bannon's on-stage gesture appeared to mirror one from tech billionaire-turned-presidential adviser Elon Musk during Donald Trump's inauguration in January. Musk also denied he had performed a Nazi salute after an uproar. Bardella, seen as a future French presidential hopeful, was one of several high-profile international politicians scheduled to speak at Cpac during the four-day conference, which began on Wednesday. Former UK Prime Minister Liz Truss addressed the conservative bash on its first day, telling attendees that the British state was ""failing"". On Thursday, Argentine President Javier Milei handed Elon Musk a shiny chainsaw that he wielded on stage, celebrating sweeping cuts to the federal government by his Doge initiative. Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni is due to speak on Saturday, ahead of President Trump's address. The annual Cpac conference has become increasingly dominated by Trump's Make America Great Again movement, and this year, it has taken on a celebratory tone in the wake of his election victory in November. Speaker after speaker have lauded the blizzard of action launched by the White House in the month since the Republican returned to the Oval Office. Bannon was met with a standing ovation after his speech on Thursday, which ended with the controversial gesture. ""The only way that they win is if we retreat, and we are not going to retreat,"" he told the crowd. ""We're not going to surrender, we are not going to quit, we're going to fight, fight, fight."" Bannon was Trump's top adviser at the start of his first term in office before the president fired him. The firebrand conservative hosts the influential War Room podcast, listened to by legions of Trump supporters. He was released from prison in October, after serving four months for defying a congressional subpoena over the attack on the US Capitol on 6 January 2021. In another case, Bannon was spared prison time after pleading guilty earlier this month to defrauding donors over a fundraiser to build a US-Mexico border wall."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y93jgdvqjo,Ex-Proud Boys leader arrested outside US Capitol,2025-02-21T22:41:49.912Z,Mike Wendling,"The former leader of the far-right Proud Boys was arrested on Friday outside the US Capitol, police said. Enrique Tarrio, who was pardoned by President Donald Trump for his role in the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol, was arrested not long after holding a news conference on Friday. Protesters attempted to drown out the event, held near the site of the riot, but Tarrio's remarks to media went ahead as planned. In a statement, US Capitol Police said that after the event concluded and the Proud Boys were leaving the area, a woman put a phone near Tarrio's face. Officers allegedly saw him strike the phone and the woman's arm. At the news conference, Tarrio was joined by several other members of the group and by Stewart Rhodes, the leader of the Oath Keepers militia. Tarrio and the other Proud Boys announced plans to sue the US justice department over their imprisonment. They criticised prison conditions and said they had used a cryptocurrency to raise funds to launch the suit. A group of about 200 Proud Boys was at the US Capitol riot, and dozens were arrested and convicted before being released after Trump issued a blanket pardon on the first day of his second term in office. Following his release from prison, Tarrio hinted that he would resume his role at the helm of the Proud Boys, although some of the group's local chapters have rejected his leadership. During the news conference, while counter-demonstrators chanted against his group, Tarrio called Capitol rioters ""peaceful protesters"" and repeated conspiracy theories that the disorder that day ""was orchestrated by none other than the government itself"". Both Tarrio and Rhodes were convicted of seditious conspiracy for their roles in the US Capitol riot, which saw supporters storm Congress as lawmakers certified Joe Biden's election victory. One of the rioters, un unarmed woman, was shot dead by police, and a police officer died of a stroke the day afterwards. Tarrio had been banned from the city of Washington due to previous criminal charges and watched the riot itself on TV from nearby Baltimore. He was sentenced to 22 years in prison. Rhodes was near the Capitol but stayed outside while members of his militia entered the building. He was sentenced to 18 years in prison. Both were among the nearly 1,600 people pardoned by Trump."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0jgw4dv3dgo,Shackled Luigi Mangione in packed court over healthcare CEO Brian Thompson's killing,2025-02-21T22:07:39.807Z,Madeline Halpert and Nada Tawfik,"A lawyer for Luigi Mangione, accused of killing UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson, has argued that the 26-year-old is not being granted the right to a fair trial. The comments came during a brief procedural hearing on Friday, which drew hundreds of supporters - some from as far as Kansas - chanting the defendant's name and wearing shirts adorned with his face. Mr Mangione arrived in court with his hands and legs shackled, wearing a green sweater and a bulletproof vest. He has pleaded not guilty to the New York charges. The killing of Mr Thompson, 50, a husband and father of two, sparked a nationwide conversation about the US healthcare system, unleashing pent-up anger at the industry and some ugly reaction. Chants from Mr Mangione’s supporters could be heard from the court’s 15th floor on Friday. His brief appearance drew more people than the number that attended the public gallery in the same courtroom last year for President Donald Trump’s hush money trial. Some of Mr Mangione's supporters wore face masks and green Luigi hats, from the Super Mario video game franchise. ""What a joke,"" muttered a court officer watching the spectacle. Among members of the public in court was Chelsea Manning, who was convicted more than a decade ago of espionage for leaking secret military files to Wikileaks. Investigators say Mr Mangione was motivated to kill Mr Thompson because of anger with US healthcare insurance companies. In addition to the New York state-level charges, he is accused of federal stalking and murder offences that could potentially carry a death penalty. The separate cases were a source of frustration for Mr Mangione's lawyer, Karen Friedman Agnifilo, who argued before the packed court on Friday that her client was being treated differently to other defendants. ""His right to a fair trial is continuing to be impacted,"" she said at the hearing, which lasted less than 30 minutes. She cited her client's detainment in federal custody and remarks made by city officials about the case as factors that could influence the proceedings. At the beginning of the hearing to discuss a pre-trial schedule, Ms Agnifilo said her client should not have to be shackled while in court, arguing it denied him the presumption of innocence guaranteed to all defendants. ""He is a model prisoner"" in federal custody, Ms Agnifilo said. But Judge Gregory Carro said court security preferred for Mr Mangione to remain shackled. Ms Agnifilo also took issue with Mr Mangione remaining in federal custody. She said the federal jail made it harder for him to meet lawyers to prepare for his court appearances. Mr Mangione's lawyer also complained that the chief New York City detective on the case and Mayor Eric Adams had spoken to HBO, the US TV network, about evidence that the defendant's legal team had not even seen yet. During the proceedings, prosecutors went over the mountain of evidence they plan to present at trial, including DNA, police reports and photographs from the scenes of the crime, body camera footage, phone records and other materials. The judge set a deadline of 9 April to submit pre-trial motions. In addition to the New York cases, Mr Mangione also faces charges of forgery, carrying firearms without a licence, and other counts in Pennsylvania, where authorities arrested him at a McDonald's. A fundraiser for legal expenses for Mr Mangione - an Ivy League-educated member of a prominent Baltimore family - has raised over half a million dollars since his arrest. He is being held at the Metropolitan Detention Center Brooklyn, the same facility where Sean 'Diddy' Combs is awaiting trial on sex-trafficking charges."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyg54r9897o,"LA mayor sacks fire chief, blaming her for mishandling wildfires",2025-02-21T21:29:02.739Z,Samantha Granville,"Los Angeles Mayor Karen Bass has sacked the city's fire chief, blaming her for mishandling the response to last month's devastating wildfires. Bass said Kristin Crowley had failed to warn her about an imminent fire risk. ""We know that 1,000 firefighters that could have been on duty on the morning the fires broke out were instead sent home on Chief Crowley's watch,"" the mayor also said in a statement. Bass has appointed Ronnie Villanueva, an LAFD veteran, as interim fire chief. The wildfires claimed 26 lives, destroyed thousands of homes, and displaced over 150,000 residents. The city charter allows the mayor to fire department heads, including the chief, without city council approval. However, Crowley has 10 days to appeal, and would need a two-thirds council vote (10 members) to overturn Bass's decision. While securing those votes is unlikely, even a failed appeal could politically challenge Bass. The mayor has taken political heat for her response to the historic fires, almost since the moment they broke out while she was out of the country. Bass had travelled to Ghana in early January, despite the National Weather Service warning of the heightened risk of wildfires and damage from a major windstorm. Crowley and Bass tussled publicly, too, over the response - with Crowley blaming budget cuts for problems with trying to contain the fires, even though the department's operating budget had technically grown. At a press conference on Friday where Bass repeated her belief that Los Angeles was not properly prepared and that residents' lives had been at risk, the mayor said she knew she wanted to fire then-Chief Crowley weeks ago. She said she decided to wait until the city was out of a state of emergency. Calling the firefighters heroic in taking on the Palisades fire, Bass added that ""bringing new leadership to the fire department is what they and the people of Los Angeles deserve"". One of Bass's biggest critics, Rick Caruso, a major force in local business and real estate who ran for mayor, blasted Bass on X for firing Crowley, saying the former chief had spoken ""honestly about the severe and profoundly ill-conceived budget cuts the Bass administration made"" and alleging she had been fired for speaking out. ""The Mayor's decision to ignore the warnings and leave the city was hers alone,"" he also wrote. ""This is a time for city leaders to take responsibility for their actions and their decisions."" Kristin Crowley made history as the department's first female fire chief when she was appointed in 2022. During her tenure, she prioritized firefighter recruitment, diversity initiatives, and modernizing outdated department policies. However, her leadership faced controversy, particularly regarding staffing shortages during the recent fires. Current and retired LAFD chief officers have accused her of mismanaging the wildfire response, highlighting in a recent letter issues such as inadequate evacuation plans and insufficient firefighting resources. They called for her resignation, saying that ""a large number of Chief Officers do not believe you are up to the task."" Crowley also faced backlash for her focus on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives within the department. Her critics argued that this emphasis diverted attention from essential firefighting operations, potentially compromising the department's effectiveness during crises. LAFD spokesperson Erik Scott said the department was ""aware of the mayor's announcement"" and had ""no further comments or interviews on this matter at this time."" Bass has called for a full investigation into the wildfires response, and Governor Gavin Newsom has called for a similar investigation at the state level. "
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crkn4m0ym32o,Salman Rushdie attacker found guilty of attempted murder and assault,2025-02-21T20:49:02.020Z,Alys Davies,"A New Jersey man who stabbed renowned British-Indian author Sir Salman Rushdie multiple times on a New York lecture stage has been convicted of attempted murder and assault. Hadi Matar, 27, now faces a sentence of more than 30 years in prison. The attack in August 2022 left Sir Salman with severe injuries including damage to his liver, vision loss in one eye and a paralysed hand caused by nerve damage to his arm. The jury's guilty verdict on Friday came after a two-week trial in Chautauqua County Court in western New York state, near the site of the attack. The jury also found Matar guilty of assault for wounding the interviewer, Henry Reese, who was on stage with the author. Mr Reese suffered a minor head injury during the attack. Matar's sentencing date has been scheduled for 23 April. Sir Salman, 77, testified that he was on stage at the historic Chautauqua Institution when he saw a man rushing towards him. Recalling the incident, he said he was struck by the assailant's eyes, ""which were dark and seemed very ferocious"". He initially thought he had been punched, before realising he had been stabbed - 15 times in total - with wounds to his eye, cheek, neck, chest, torso and thigh. The attack took place more than 35 years after Sir Salman's novel, The Satanic Verses, was first published. The novel, inspired by the life of the Muslim Prophet Muhammad, sparked outrage among some Muslims, who considered its content to be blasphemous. The book was banned in some countries after it was published in 1988. Sir Salman faced countless death threats and was forced into hiding for nine years after Iran's religious leader issued a fatwa - or decree - calling for the author's death due to the book. But in recent years, the author said he believed the threats against him had diminished. During the trial's closing arguments on Friday, prosecuting lawyer Jason Schmidt played a video in slow-motion of the attack, the Associated Press reports. ""I want you to look at the targeted nature of the attack,"" Mr Schmidt said in court, according to the news outlet. ""There were a lot of people around that day but there was only one person who was targeted,"" he told the jury. During the two-week trial, defence lawyer Andrew Brautigan argued that prosecutors had failed to prove Matar intended to kill Sir Salman. Matar had pleaded not guilty. His lawyers declined to call any witnesses of their own and Matar did not testify in his defence. In an interview with the New York Post from jail in 2022, Matar praised Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Khomeini, for calling for Sir Salman's execution. ""I don't think he's a very good person,"" Matar said about the author. ""He's someone who attacked Islam."" He added that he had only read a few pages of the Satanic Verses. Matar, born in Fairview in New Jersey to parents who emigrated from Lebanon, has also been charged in a separate federal case with providing material support to the Lebanon-based militant group Hezbollah, according to an indictment unsealed in July. Hezbollah is designated a terrorist organisation by Western states, Israel, Gulf Arab countries and the Arab League."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ym8yyremeo,Judge pauses NYC mayor Eric Adams trial in corruption case,2025-02-21T19:06:16.288Z,Rachel Looker,"A judge paused the trial against New York City Mayor Eric Adams on Friday to gather further arguments, according to a new court order. US District Judge Dale Ho has ordered an outside lawyer to get involved in the case and argue whether the charges should be dismissed. Adams is facing fraud, bribery and other charges, but he denies any wrongdoing. Trump administration officials aim to dismiss the case against him, arguing that it has damaged his ability to aid the president's agenda. Adams' trial, scheduled for mid-April, is now off the calendar indefinitely. Long time US Supreme Court lawyer Paul Clement has been tapped as the outside lawyer, with possible oral arguments to begin 14 March. Clement is a former US Solicitor General who served during the George W Bush administration. He has often represented conservative positions at the Supreme Court. Judge Ho wrote in court documents that the appointment of Clement is ""appropriate"" adding, ""particularly so in light of the public importance of this case."" Before the judge earlier this week, Justice Department lawyers defended their decision to end the criminal case against Adams. Emil Bove, a top official at the department who served as Trump's criminal defence lawyer, instructed federal prosecutors last week to drop the case. Bove argued that the case against Adams had ""restricted"" the mayor's ability to address ""illegal immigration and violent crime"" - two of President Donald Trump's key priorities. Manhattan's lead prosecutor and six other high-level Justice officials resigned in protest, saying there was no legal justification for the directive. Danielle Sassoon, the interim US attorney for the Southern District of New York, was the first of the lead prosecutors to resign. In a letter to the US attorney general, she alleged that Adams' lawyers - while meeting with Bove and other prosecutors - ""repeatedly urged what amounted to a quid pro quo"" in an effort to dismiss the case. Bove's office later filed a motion to dismiss, prompting the judge to call a hearing. During an interview alongside Trump's border czar Tom Homan last week, Adams denied his side had proposed that the Justice Department drop the case in exchange for immigration measures, a move Sassoon had said amounted to a ""quid pro quo"". Adams said the allegations were ""silly"". Several New York officials in the state and the city have called for Adams to be removed from office or for him to resign. Despite having the authority, New York Governor Kathy Hochul decided on Thursday not to remove Adams from office. Instead, she announced a plan to limit his authority. The New York governor said she would propose legislation and measures aimed at exerting more oversight over the mayor's office. Adams responded there would have been no legal basis to remove him. Hochul proposed a new inspector general position for New York City, providing more resources for officials to take legal action against the Trump administration, and expanding funding for the state comptroller's office to conduct more oversight of the city. Adams was indicted last year for allegedly accepting gifts totalling more than $100,000 (£75,000) from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours. He denies the charges. His administration has been plagued by staff departures and scandals, even prior to the charges being announced against him. A number of figures in his orbit have also been charged as part of the investigation."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly25yny3ego,Musk wields his Doge chainsaw - but is a backlash brewing?,2025-02-21T18:03:20.768Z,Anthony Zurcher,"Wearing a black ""Make America Great Again"" hat and dark sunglasses, Elon Musk - the multi-billionaire tasked by Donald Trump with taking a metaphorical chainsaw to the federal government - received a rock-star welcome as he took the stage at a right-wing gathering on Thursday. He even had a literal chainsaw. As the crowd of several thousand cheered, Argentine President Javier Milei, also a favourite at the annual Cpac event, emerged from backstage. He handed Musk a shiny chainsaw with ""viva la Libertad carajo! – Spanish for ""Long live liberty, damn it!""- emblazoned on the blade. Musk waved the power tool high, shouting: ""This is the chainsaw for bureaucracy! Chainsaw!"" It was a remarkable moment on a day typified by less animated speeches about the dangers of big government and the accomplishments of Trump's first month back in the White House. It demonstrated how Musk is the only conservative who approaches Trump's ability to energise a crowd. Outside of Washington, however, there are signs that Musk's chainsaw approach to federal government – which includes shuttering agencies, defunding programmes and mass civil service layoffs – may be cutting too close to the bone. At about the same time as Musk was celebrating the work of his so-called ""Department of Government Efficiency"" at the event near Washington DC, Republican congressman Rich McCormick was holding a town hall forum for his constituents. Many in Roswell, Georgia, were angry about the impact of the Musk-inspired cuts and let the congressman know it. ""Congress controls the budget, not the president,"" a woman said. ""You are doing a disservice to set that down and not stand up for us."" McCormick's response was drowned out by jeers. ""I understand trying to do more with less – that's reasonable,"" another constituent said. ""What's not reasonable is taking this chainsaw approach."" Earlier this month, Pew Research found that 54% of Americans have an unfavourable view of Musk, including 37% that responded ""very unfavourable"". Only 23% of Americans told Reuters-Ipsos pollsters this week that the president has the right to fire ""any federal employee who disagrees with the president"". Fifty-eight percent said they were concerned that popular government programmes, like Social Security retirement benefits for the elderly and subsidised student loans – could be affected. Just over half of Americans in a CNN poll said Trump had gone ""too far"" in exercising his presidential power. At an earlier event at Cpac on Thursday, Speaker of the House Mike Johnson praised Musk and his team. ""They are exposing this massive fraud, waste and abuse that we have not been able to uncover because the deep state has hidden it from us,"" he said. Many Republicans have agreed with this sentiment, even if it means ceding congressional power over government spending to the president. Congressional conservatives have been trying to downsize the federal government for decades with limited effectiveness – and now Musk and Trump are delivering, albeit through a sweeping expansion of executive power. North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis told CBS News he believed Doge's approach was necessary because Republicans had failed to get legitimate answers from bureaucrats about how to make government more efficient. ""And the way to force people to justify investments on exceptions is to shut everything down,"" Tillis said. ""I know it's disruptive, but I think they need to have the capacity to bring things back online that make sense."" That may change, however, if Trump's poll numbers – which have dipped slightly recently – continue to decline and if Republican legislators are challenged by constituents at town hall meetings or have their offices flooded with angry calls. Members of Congress across the US have begun stepping forward to defend federal programmes – including funding for academic research, agriculture, veterans services and national parks – that have been affected by Musk's ""Department of Government Efficiency"" actions. Senator Katie Britt of Alabama called for a ""smart, targeted approach"" to cuts that could target health research conducted in her home state. Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski, a moderate Republican, complained on social media that many of the proposed layoffs ""will do more harm than good"". ""I share the administration's goal of reducing the size of the federal government,"" she wrote on X, ""but this approach is bringing confusion, anxiety and now trauma to our civil servants."" The Trump administration has already walked back some of its announced layoffs in key sectors – including Department of Energy employees who handle nuclear weapons security, Department of Agriculture teams tasked with containing the recent outbreak of bird flu, and workers in a programme that monitors the health of first responders and survivors of the 11 September World Trade Center attack. ""I think many of these firings are indiscriminate,"" said Susan Collins of Maine, another centrist Republican senator. ""The fact that workers were let go who are working on avian flu, and the fact that workers have also been fired who are responsible for nuclear safety, shows that we need a far more careful approach."" At his appearance last week at the White House, Musk acknowledged that his team might make mistakes in its eagerness to slash government spending – ""but we will act quickly to correct any mistakes"", he promised. That may be cold comfort for Americans adversely affected by the Doge chainsaw, however. And it could come at a political price. History has shown that even when mistakes are fixed, voters often remember these kind of missteps the next time they head to the polls."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl0kw7136ko,Ten NY prison guards charged in fatal beating of inmate,2025-02-21T16:32:59.516Z,Mike Wendling,"Ten former New York state prison guards have been charged in connection with the fatal beating of a prison inmate. Officers were seen on body camera footage hitting Robert Brooks while he sat handcuffed on a medical examination table at the Marcy Correctional Facility in December 2024. Brooks died the following day. On Thursday, a grand jury handed down indictments on charges including second-degree murder, manslaughter and tampering with evidence. Of the nine officers who appeared in court on Thursday, all pleaded not guilty. Another is set to appear in court next week, the county district attorney said. Bodycam videos appear to show a prison officer placing something in Brooks's mouth before striking him, and another officer hitting him in the stomach with a shoe. At one point, an officer is seen lifting Brooks by the neck before forcefully putting him on the examination table. A medical examiner ruled Brooks's death a homicide. A special prosecutor assigned to the case, Onandaga County District Attorney William Fitzpatrick, detailed Brooks's serious injuries on Thursday, including broken bones and cartilage, bruising to his internal organs and repeated restrictions to his airways which caused severe brain damage. Brooks ""did absolutely nothing"" to provoke the assault and ultimately died by choking on his own blood, Fitzpatrick said, according to the BBC's US news partner CBS. Shortly after the incident, New York Governor Kathy Hochul ordered the firing of 13 officers and a prison nurse who were allegedly involved in the assault. Fitzpatrick said prison officers Anthony Farina, Nicholas Anzalone, David Kingsley, Christopher Walrath and Mathew Galliher were charged with second-degree murder, which carries a maximum sentence of life in prison. All five pleaded not guilty at arraignments on Thursday. Michael Mashaw, Michael Fisher and David Walters were charged with manslaughter and face a sentence of up to 15 years if convicted, while Nicholas Gentile was charged with tampering with evidence, which is punishable by up to four years behind bars. They all pleaded not guilty to the charges. Another unnamed suspect indicted for second-degree murder will surrender at a later date, Fitzpatrick said, and three others, also unnamed by authorities, have reached plea agreements. The union that represents the officers, New York State Correctional Officers & Police Benevolent Association, said the actions of those involved in the incident were ""incomprehensible and not reflective of the majority of our membership"". In a statement it added: ""The indictments and arrests today of those officers who allegedly were involved in causing Mr. Brooks death, should be afforded the same presumption of innocence that every citizen is afforded until proven guilty in a court of law."" Several attorneys for the defendants declined to comment on the case Friday, and the BBC attempted to contact legal representatives for the other officers. The investigation into Brooks's death continues. At the time of his death, Brooks, 43, had served nine years of a 12-year prison sentence for stabbing his son's mother. He had been transferred to the Marcy prison, about 220 miles (350km) north of New York City, from a nearby facility just hours before the beating."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93npyelnewo,Farmers say bird flu a 'crisis' as egg prices soar,2025-02-21T16:10:59.472Z,Madeline Halpert,"For Brian Kreher, a fourth-generation farmer in the small town of Clarence, New York, the latest outbreak of bird flu has meant many sleepless nights. He considers his 18-acre farm one of the lucky ones. With extensive safety precautions, he hasn't lost any birds to the virus, which has ravaged poultry farms across the US. But the outbreak forced him to make tough calls, like deciding whether to accept a new batch of baby chicks from a hatchery near a virus hotspot in Pennsylvania. If he didn't, he would have no chickens to replace those that die or get sick. ""I had no choice,"" Kreher told the BBC. ""It was either accept those baby chicks, or over the next year, we slowly exit farming."" ""Egg farmers are in the fight of our lives and we are losing,"" he said. Though the avian flu, or H5N1, has circulated among American poultry flocks for years, an outbreak starting in 2022 has wreaked havoc on farms, killing over 156 million birds and sending egg prices skyrocketing. The virus then got a foothold among dairy cows last year, and this month, a different strain - tied to severe infections in humans - was found in the cattle. The worsening outbreak comes as President Donald Trump's new administration makes sweeping cuts to government staffing and research funding that public health experts say threatens the country's ability to respond to bird flu and other potential pandemics. This week, the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) told the BBC it fired several officials who were working on the response to bird flu before trying to hire them back days later. The administration also promised billions in funding cuts to the National Institutes of Health, which scientists say could hamper research that helps them understand the evolution of viruses. ""Right now, the risk to most Americans remains low, but the virus is continuing to surprise us, and so that could change, and could change quickly,"" said Michaela Simoneau, a global health security fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. ""I worry, as all of these funding cuts are in the political conversation, that we don't cut those programs that have been shown to be most essential."" Trump officials said they are working on a new plan to respond to bird flu, one that includes more safety precautions and vaccines while moving away from culling - a process where farmers kill all their birds after one flock becomes infected to prevent the spread of the highly contagious and fatal disease. When asked for details about the new strategy, the White House did not provide specifics to the BBC, but said Joe Biden's administration had ""crushed American agriculture with regulatory uncertainty"", inflation and ""radical environmental policies"". Scientists have seen a number of warning signs in recent months that the avian flu is adapting to infect humans, said Andrew Pekosz, a molecular biology professor at Johns Hopkins University. Influenza viruses don't typically grow well in mammals, so the length of time the virus has circulated in dairy cows is concerning because it allows more opportunities to evolve, Mr Pekosz said. Bird flu infected cattle for the first time ever in the US at the beginning of last year. Since then, there have been nearly 1,000 confirmed cases across 17 states. There also have been 68 confirmed cases among humans, most of whom worked closely with animals. Then, in February, a new variant of the virus - called D1.1 - was detected in dairy cows and an infected worker in Nevada for the first time. The strain also caused two severe infections in humans in North America, a teenager in hospital in British Columbia and a patient in Louisiana who died from the virus. The new variant also means there are now at least two instances in which cows have caught the virus from wild birds, and not other dairy herds. ""We're seeing these little red flags, real signs that the virus is making some inroads,"" Mr Pekosz said. The virus has upended poultry and dairy farms where workers have had to kill millions of birds to prevent more infections. It's a battle US consumers have felt at the grocery store and a recurring theme during the presidential campaign - in January, the average cost of eggs in the US rose more than 15% from a year ago, to $4.95 a dozen. Mr Kreher said that despite a host of security measures, including washing vehicles on farms, wearing steel-toed boots and using lasers to deter wild birds, the outbreak continues to worsen across the country. Bird flu ""is on our minds from the moment we get up to the moment we sleep, if sleep comes"", he said. ""We need new strategies to fight this virus."" California poultry farmer Christian Alexandre has seen firsthand the financial and emotional devastation of a bird flu outbreak. In 2022, he had to kill all 45,000 of his chickens when the virus spread at his family farm near the Oregon border. ""It was extremely painful,"" said Mr Alexandre, president of the American Pastured Poultry Producers Association. In response to soaring egg prices, Trump officials now say they want to move away from the slaughtering, focusing instead on preventative measures. Kevin Hassett, director of the National Economic Council, told the BBC's US partner CBS News last week that he is working on a plan with newly confirmed USDA leader Brooke Rollins to combat the virus ""with biosecurity and medication"". ""Rollins and I have been working with all the best people in government, including academics around the country and around the world, to have a plan ready for the president next week,"" Hassett said. Mr Alexandre said he was not sure that vaccinations and other precautions could replace the need to cull flocks - but he said new ideas were desperately needed. ""What farmers and the USDA have been doing has just obviously not worked,"" he said. ""We're in a crisis."" Vaccines for birds against the avian flu already exist in countries around the world, and last week, the USDA granted conditional approval to a new shot developed by Zoetis. Still, many poultry industry groups oppose vaccinating birds against the virus. This is because most countries don't accept exports of poultry that are vaccinated because of fears that it masks the presence of the virus, said Tom Super of the National Chicken Council. Public health experts have been critical of the US government's response to bird flu since the virus first spread to dairy cows, arguing Biden officials fell short in their disease surveillance efforts. But Trump's team has slowed communications about the disease, which also concerns public health experts. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has reportedly withheld weekly reports on bird flu and canceled weeks of briefings with lawmakers and state health officials. ""I haven't seen anything from this administration that would say that they're taking this outbreak any more seriously,"" Mr Pekosz said. Ms Simoneau sees one encouraging sign from the Trump administration: Gerald Parker, a bird flu expert, veterinarian and former top-ranking health official, was chosen to lead the White House's Pandemic Office. At the same time, she said, the wide cuts and the decision to withdraw from the World Health Organization under Trump's leadership could hamper efforts to respond to H5N1. ""We're cutting ourselves off from that global information system at a time when we really need all of those signals that we can get,"" she said. Ms Simoneau said fatigue and a decrease in trust in public health officials following the Covid pandemic makes for a difficult environment for any administration to respond to a potential health crisis. But, she said, the threat is one Trump officials should take seriously. ""We don't know if this could be an emergency for humans next week, or if it could be several months from now, or if it might not happen at all,"" Ms Simoneau said. ""But taking your eye off the ball isn't really an option."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c74k9ppdwzeo,Grand jury recommends Alabama police department be 'abolished',2025-02-21T15:32:01.083Z,,"An Alabama grand jury has called for the city of Hanceville's police department to be ""immediately abolished"", arguing the officials were acting like ""more of a criminal enterprise"" than as law enforcement. It comes as five of the small town's officers - including the police chief - were arrested as a part of a probe into the department, local officials said ""This is a sad day for law enforcement, but at the same time, it is a good day for the rule of law,"" Cullman County District Attorney Champ Crocker said at a news conference. The entire police force was placed on administrative leave a day after the arrests were announced. The district attorney on Wednesday indicted police chief Jason Shane Marlin, officers Cody Alan Kelso, 33; Jason Scott Wilbanks, 37; William Andrew Shelnutt, 39; Eric Michael Kelso, 44; and his wife, Donna Reid Kelso, 63. The six are accused of tampering with evidence, misusing state criminal databases and distributing controlled substances to each other. The probe started after a 911 dispatcher, 49-year-old Christopher Michael Willingham, died of a drug overdose at the police department last year. The Alabama grand jury found that his death was the ""direct result"" of the police department's ""negligence, lack of procedure, general incompetence and disregard for human life"", Mr Crocker said at the news conference. The grand jury found that the department more generally had failed to preserve and maintain evidence, allowing people who were not authorised to access evidence to do so. The panel recommended that another agency take the lead in policing the small city because of ""a rampant culture of corruption"". In a statement on Wednesday, Jim Sawyer, the mayor of Hanceville, said the city would fully cooperate with all probes into the police department. He added that the city council would consider the grand jury's recommendations ""and act swiftly and decisively to address the problems""."

Christina Fulton accuses her 34-year-old son, Weston Cage, whom she described as a ""300-pound professional fighter"", of attacking her without provocation. According to the lawsuit, Fulton, 57, is suing her son for assault and battery and Cage, 61, for negligence, claiming he failed to prevent their son's alleged behaviour. The lawsuit seeks unspecified damages for the ""catastrophic physical, emotional, and economic harm she has endured due to an unprovoked attack by their son, Weston"". Nicolas Cage's lawyers called the lawsuit ""frivolous"". Weston Cage was arrested in June last year and charged with two felony counts of assault with a deadly weapon following accusations that he attacked his mother and another individual. He pleaded not guilty to both charges. Ms Fulton claims she visited her son on 28 April 2024 after receiving ""urgent messages"" from his friends, according to the civil complaint submitted to the Los Angeles County Superior Court. Upon arriving, she alleges he attacked her in a ""manic rage"", assaulting her in the car park, lift and lobby of his residence. The lawsuit says she was left with a concussion, multiple contusions, neck and throat injuries, dental trauma, tinnitus, abdominal trauma and PTSD. Ms Fulton alleges that Nicolas Cage was aware of their son's ""long history of mental and psychological disorder"" and previous alleged acts of ""violent assault and battery"", but continued to enable such behaviour by providing financial support. The lawsuit adds that Mr Cage bought an apartment for their son next door to his own residence, bailed him out of jail multiple times, and drank alcohol with him despite knowing about his alleged struggles with substance abuse. In a statement to the BBC, Nicolas Cage's lawyer, Brian Wolf, said the lawsuit was ""absurd"". ""Weston Coppola is a 34 year old man,"" Mr Wolf said. ""Mr Cage does not control Weston's behavior in any manner and is not responsible for Weston's alleged assault of his mother."" Weston Cage's lawyer, Michael A Goldstein, said Ms Fulton's decision to file a lawsuit against her own son was not surprising, given what he described as her past history of litigation against family members. ""It appears to be nothing short of a money grab and call for attention,"" said Mr Goldstein. Ms Fulton correctly advised the responding LAPD officers that her son was in the midst of a mental health crisis at the time of the incident, he added. In an interview with the BBC, Joseph Farzam, the attorney representing Ms Fulton, agreed that most people are not responsible for their adult children's actions. But he said the law was very clear that a parent can be responsible for an adult child with any mental disability if they cannot support themselves. ""This is a unique situation,"" he told the BBC. ""Weston has a history of violence and his father has not stopped him, but enabled him, bailed him and made the situation much worse."" Ms Fulton, who was in a relationship with Nicolas Cage from 1988-91, previously sued the actor in 2009 over a financial dispute. She alleged he owed her $13m (£10m) and had reneged on a promise to buy her a home in Hancock Park, a wealthy LA enclave. That case was settled in 2011 under undisclosed terms. This is not the first bout of legal trouble for Weston Cage. In 2011, he and his then-wife, Nikki Williams, were arrested on felony domestic violence charges. In 2017, he was detained on suspicion of driving under the influence and hit-and-run. He pleaded no contest, was given three years of probation and had to go to a recovery programme and complete community service."

Canada's thrilling 3-2 overtime win in the 4 Nations Face Off final in Boston took place amid rising tensions between the two neighbours. Not only is there the looming threat of an economically damaging trade war, there are Trump's persistent musings on making Canada the 51st US state. The American national anthem has been regularly booed by Canadian sports fans in recent weeks but this time it was the US home fans doing most of the booing. As their jeers rang out, the Canadian national anthem was sung with different lyrics in protest over Trump's statements. A representative for singer Chantal Kreviazuk told CBC News she intentionally sang ""that only us command"" instead of ""in all of us command"". In a post on Instagram with a photo of the adjusted lyrics, Kreviazuk said: ""We should express our outrage in the face of any abuses of power."" On any ordinary day, this fixture would have been a significant one for the two neighbouring countries who have long been friendly rivals on the ice. But recent events gave it added spice. And the sudden-death goal from Connor McDavid which sealed the win prompted delirium among the travelling fans. The US president was unable to make the game but he called the team to wish them good luck. He also repeated his desire to absorb Canada, writing in a Truth Social post ahead of the game that he hoped the country ""will someday, maybe soon, become our cherished and very important, Fifty First State"". For fans across North America, the final was a ""dream match-up,"" ice hockey writer Daniel Nugent-Bowman told the BBC. Not since the 2014 Winter Olympics had the top men's ice hockey players from Canada and the US faced off in such a consequential game. Both countries boast some of the biggest stars in the National Hockey League (NHL), like Canadians Mitch Marner and McDavid, and Americans Auston Matthews and Jack Eichel. The game was a chance for this new generation of players to prove themselves. But in Canada, the game was also a personal one, giving both die-hard and casual fans an opportunity to bask in national pride at a time when the country's sovereignty looks to be threatened by its closest neighbour. Few Canadians would dispute how integral ice hockey is to the country's national identity. The sport has served as a backdrop to some of the most patriotic moments in Canada's history, like Sidney Crosby's overtime gold medal goal at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver. Historically, Canada has had the upper hand against the US. The two countries have met 20 times in best-on-best tournaments since the 1976 Canada Cup, with Canada winning 14 of those games."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg1ln145l3o,Kash Patel vows to 'rebuild' FBI after Senate confirms him,2025-02-21T02:39:39.077Z,Brandon Drenon,"The FBI's new director, Kash Patel, has vowed to ""rebuild"" the bureau after he was confirmed by the US Senate to lead the law-enforcement agency that he has long attacked. The upper chamber of Congress narrowly approved President Donald Trump's nominee by 51-49. Two Republicans voted no. Democrats had warned he would seek retribution against Trump's enemies, although the nominee has denied any plans to pursue political vendettas. In his confirmation hearings, Patel, 44, also denied keeping a list of ""deep state"" enemies, while playing down controversial past remarks he had made such as referring to law enforcement officials who investigated Trump as ""criminal gangsters"". Patel was voted against by all Democratic senators and two Republicans who have often dissented, Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska. He was the 18th cabinet official approved by lawmakers since Trump was inaugurated a month ago. ""I am honored to be confirmed as the ninth Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation,"" Patel said on X, shortly after he was confirmed by the Senate. ""My mission as Director is clear: let good cops be cops - and rebuild trust in the FBI."" ""We will rebuild an FBI the American people can be proud of,"" he added. Patel takes the helm of an FBI in flux after the justice department forced out some of its top officials and demanded the names of agents who investigated the 2021 riot by Trump supporters at the US Capitol. News of Patel's confirmation was greeted by an ovation on the other side of Washington DC where Republicans were gathering for the annual Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC). Florida Senator Rick Scott stood on CPAC's stage and asked the crowd: ""What do you think about Kash Patel?"" Loud applause was the response. To most Republicans, Patel is a disruptor who will lead an overdue shake up the nation's top law enforcement agency, which they and Trump claim has been weaponised against conservatives. But Democrats say Patel is a far-right conspiracy theorist with little experience in law enforcement, and someone who would put fealty to Trump above his oath to lead a department that is meant to operate independently. ""[Patel's] poor judgment and lack of experience make him wholly unqualified to keep Americans safe as our FBI Director. I voted no,"" Senator Martin Heinrich said on X. Patel replaces Christopher Wray who Trump picked in 2017. Wray resigned before inauguration day last month, after the incoming Republican president indicated he would fire him."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy83958r2d0o,Zizians: What we know about the 'cult' linked to six deaths,2025-02-21T02:05:38.256Z,Mike Wendling,"A cult-like US group known as Zizians has been linked to a string of murders, sparking several arrests – who are the people behind this group and what do they believe? Jack Lasota, 34, who allegedly leads a group of a few dozen followers known as Zizians, was arrested on Sunday alongside Michelle Zajko, 32, and Daniel Blank, 26, on charges including trespassing and obstruction. Authorities say they are investigating at least six killings across the US that are allegedly connected to members of the group, including a double homicide in Pennsylvania, a knife attack in California, and the shooting of a US border guard in January. Three other alleged members of the group have already been charged with murder. Lasota, a transgender woman, is allegedly the leader of the group. She earned a degree in computer science from the University of Alaska-Fairbanks in 2013 and, according to her blog, moved to the San Francisco area three years later. There, she wrote that she applied for a series of jobs at tech companies and startups - including a brief internship with Nasa - and began to associate with people involved in the rationalist movement, an intellectual trend popular in Silicon Valley that emphasises the power of the human mind to see clear truth, eliminate bias and bad thinking, and improve individuals and society. Lasota began blogging using the alias ""Ziz"", but soon fell out with mainstream rationalists as her writings spun off in bizarre directions. The blog included posts of thousands of words, blending Lasota's personal experiences, theories about technology and philosophy, and esoteric comments about pop culture, computer coding and dozens of other subjects. At one point, during a long diatribe about the TV series The Office, artificial intelligence and other subjects, she wrote: ""I realized that I was no longer able to stand people. Not even rationalists anymore. And I would live the rest of my life completely alone, hiding my reaction to anyone it was useful to interact with. I had given up my ability to see beauty so I could see evil."" Other themes included veganism – total avoidance of any animal food or products – and anarchism. In 2019 Lasota and three others were arrested while holding a protest outside an event held by a rationalist organisation. The last posts on her blog date from around this time. Over the next few years, Lasota and others would move around the US, according to reports, at one point living on a boat, and later staying on property owned by others in California and North Carolina. In 2022, a warrant was issued when Lasota failed to show up for a court hearing, related to the protest outside the rationalist organisation meeting. But her lawyer at the time stated she was ""now deceased after a boating accident in the San Francisco Bay area"". An obituary - noting that Lasota loved ""adventure, friends and family, music, blueberries, biking, computer games and animals"" - even appeared in an Alaska newspaper. But the story was wrong: Lasota was still alive. Jessica Taylor, an artificial intelligence researcher who says she knew several of the group members, told the Associated Press that Lasota and the Zizians stretched their rationalist beliefs to justify breaking laws. ""Stuff like thinking it's reasonable to avoid paying rent and defend oneself from being evicted,"" Taylor said. Poulomi Saha, an associate professor at the University of California, Berkeley, who studies cults, says that while there is no strict legal definition of such a group, several of the Zizians' attributes align with the popular cultural conception of the term. ""This is a group of individuals that seem to share some unorthodox viewpoints,"" she said. ""That in and of itself wouldn't open up them up to the cult label… but then there is this leadership figure 'Ziz.'"" Saha noted, however, that there is still significant uncertainty about the relationships between group members and about what may have motivated alleged acts of violence in recent years. Not long after the obituary was published, Lasota resurfaced along with other members of the group in Vallejo, California, which is north of San Francisco. Several members were living in vans and trucks on land owned by a man named Curtis Lind. At some point the Zizians allegedly stopped paying rent, and Lind sued to evict them. But the dispute escalated and in November 2022, Lind was attacked, stabbed 50 times and blinded in one eye. In an act of what police would later say is self-defence, he fired a gun, which killed Emma Borhanian, a former Google employee who was one of the Zizians and who had previously been arrested at the rationalist protest. Two other members, Suri Dao and Somni Logencia, were arrested and charged with attempting to murder Lind. They remain in prison awaiting trial. Lasota was also at the scene of the attack, but was not charged with a crime. The following month, two parents of a Zizian member were killed in a small Pennsylvania town. Richard Zajko, 71, and his wife, Rita, 69, were found shot in the head in their home. The Zajkos were the parents of Zizian member Michelle Zajko, who was briefly held by police but not charged with a crime. Lasota was arrested and charged with obstructing law enforcement and disorderly conduct in connection with the incident. Despite the links to those two attacks, the group mostly flew under the radar without receiving much wider public attention until earlier this year. On 17 January, Lind, the California landlord who had allegedly been attacked by members of the group, was killed. Vallejo Police Department say he was stabbed to death by an assailant wearing a mask and black beanie. Police later charged Maximilian Snyder with murder, and alleged that Snyder killed Lind in order to stop him from testifying during the attempted murder trial. That was followed just a few days later by the killing of a US border patrol agent on the other side of the country. Two Zizians, Teresa Youngblut and Felix Bauckholt, were pulled over by US Border Patrol Agent David Maland near the Canadian border in Vermont. A firefight ensued. Bauckholt, a German citizen who also went by the name Ophelia, was killed in the shootout along with Maland. Youngblut - who was previously known as Milo - was wounded and later arrested on firearms charges. The shooting led to a wider hunt for members of the group after police said the gun used to kill Maland was bought by Michelle Zajko. After the Vermont shootout, police in Pennsylvania said they had uncovered new evidence about the shooting of Zajko's parents, and Lasota was wanted for failing to appear at several court hearings. The whereabouts of the pair were unknown until Sunday, when they were arrested with fellow group member Daniel Blank in Maryland. A police report said a resident of Frostburg, about 160 miles (260km) north-west of Washington DC, had called police saying he wanted three ""suspicious"" people off his property after they asked to camp on his land for a month. Maryland State Police said that the trio were charged with trespassing and obstruction, and that Lasota and Zajko were additionally charged with weapons violations. All three were denied bail. A lawyer for Lasota, Daniel McGarrigle, declined to comment on the arrest but instead sent the BBC a statement he had previously issued about his client, saying: ""I urge members of the press and the public to refrain from speculation and premature conclusions."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c80yrglnn79o,Governor Hochul will not remove NYC Mayor Adams from office,2025-02-21T00:00:25.197Z,Kayla Epstein,"Governor Kathy Hochul has decided not to remove New York City Mayor Eric Adams from office, but instead announced a plan to limit his authority following a string of scandals. The New York governor said she would propose legislation and measures aimed at exerting more oversight over the mayor's office. Adams responded there would have been no legal basis to remove him. The US justice department is currently pushing to drop a corruption case against Adams, which a former top prosecutor alleged was a deal in exchange for the mayor's co-operation on immigration enforcement. Adams was indicted on corruption and bribery charges last year, and his trial is scheduled for April. The mayor pleaded not guilty and has denied wrongdoing. Announcing her proposed ""guardrails"" against Adams on Thursday, the governor said she decided not to use her power to remove the mayor as she could not defy the ""will of the voters"". In her new plan, she has proposed a new inspector general position for New York City, providing more resources for officials to take legal action against the Trump administration, and expanding funding for the state comptroller's office to conduct more oversight of the city. Hochul said these steps would ""make sure our leaders are operating only with the city's best interest in mind"". The plan would still require approval from the New York City Council and state legislature. The mayor said in a statement later: ""While there is no legal basis for limiting New Yorkers' power by limiting the authority of my office, I have told the governor, as we have done in the past, that I am willing to work with her to ensure faith in our government is strong."" Hochul's attempt to rein in the mayor comes as he awaits the decision of a New York judge regarding his corruption case. Adams was indicted last year for allegedly accepting gifts totalling more than $100,000 (£75,000) from Turkish citizens in exchange for favours. The Trump administration ordered its Manhattan prosecutors to drop the case against Adams, arguing it impedes on his official duties for national security. Shortly after the directive, the top Manhattan federal prosecutor in the case, Danielle Sassoon, resigned in protest. Several other federal prosecutors followed. In a letter to the US attorney general, Sassoon alleged that the justice department and Adams' lawyers had engaged in a quid-pro-quo for the mayor to enforce Trump's immigration policies in exchange for dropping the case. Amid the uproar, Hochul announced that she was weighing whether to use her powers to remove Adams. Adams denied he had propositioned the justice department to drop the case in exchange for immigration enforcement. His attorney, Alex Spiro, argued in court that because Adams lost his security clearance due to his criminal charges, the case should be dismissed so that he can again participate in high-level public safety conversations. The case has sent the city's government into upheaval and infuriated New Yorkers, dozens of whom appeared for Adams' hearing this week to boo him as he arrived at court. A handful of supporters held signs on the courthouse steps. As the Trump administration seeks to dismiss the charges against Adams, the president has sought to flex his influence over New York City, announcing he intends to revoke approval for the city's congestion pricing programme that started in January. In her remarks, Hochul took aim directly at the Trump administration, referring to him at one point as a ""king"". ""We know they'll stop at nothing to try to exercise control over New York,"" she said of the Trump administration."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rqpp52j5vo,Who is Kash Patel? Trump's new FBI director vows to shake up the agency,2025-02-20T23:33:21.762Z,Ana Faguy,"Kash Patel, a one-time aide to President Donald Trump, has been confirmed by the US Senate to lead the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). Patel, a former defence department chief of staff and ex-federal prosecutor, is a staunch Trump supporter and a fellow critic of the US government's top law enforcement agency. He was confirmed in a party line vote of 51-49, with only two Republicans joining all Democrats against him, citing concerns over his qualifications to lead the agency and claiming that he will pursue retribution against critics of Trump. Patel has previously suggested dramatically limiting the authority of the FBI, which Republicans allege has unfairly targeted conservatives in recent years. The FBI's outgoing director Christopher Wray has denied such allegations. Patel replaces Christopher Wray whom Trump picked in 2017. Wray resigned before inauguration day last month after the incoming Republican president indicated he would fire him. The FBI director leads 37,000 employees across 55 US field offices. They also oversee 350 satellite offices and more than 60 other foreign locations expected to cover almost 200 countries. Patel only narrowly cleared the final hurdle, reflecting the deep divisions over his nomination - the last three FBI picks were approved by at least 90 senators. In his confirmation hearings, Patel denied keeping a list of ""deep state"" enemies, while playing down controversial past remarks he had made, such as referring to law enforcement officials who investigated Trump as ""criminal gangsters"". The 60-name roster includes former President Joe Biden, former Attorney General Merrick Garland and former National Security Adviser John Bolton, among others. In his memoir Government Gangsters, published in 2023, Patel called for an eradication of what he called ""government tyranny"" within the FBI by firing ""the top ranks"". Many conservatives believe a ""deep state"", or unelected bureaucratic cabal, is working to thwart Trump's agenda. Attorney General Pam Bondi, who is now Patel's boss, told lawmakers during her confirmation hearing earlier this month that there would be no enemies list at the Department of Justice under her leadership. Patel, the son of Indian immigrants, is a former defence lawyer and federal prosecutor. He caught the attention of Trump - who was then serving his first term as president - after becoming a senior counsel to the House of Representatives intelligence committee in 2017. He quickly rose within Trump's circle after he was hired as a national security aide in 2019, and in 2020 was appointed chief of staff to the head of the Pentagon. As well as his 2023 memoir, Patel has published two pro-Trump children's books. He is on the board of Trump Media and Technology Group, which owns Trump's social media platform, Truth Social. He has also reportedly had a consulting contract with the company. After announcing Patel as his FBI pick, Trump posted on social media calling him ""an advocate for truth, accountability, and the constitution"". ""Kash is a brilliant lawyer, investigator, and 'America First' fighter who has spent his career exposing corruption, defending justice, and protecting the American people,"" Trump said."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8le2p353zo,Mitch McConnell announces he will not run for re-election,2025-02-20T18:17:28.284Z,Kayla Epstein,"US Senator Mitch McConnell has announced that he will not seek re-election in 2026 following a 40-year career in Congress. McConnell, 83, was the longest-serving party leader in Senate history, but stepped down from Republican leadership while facing health issues. Despite supporting much of Donald Trump's agenda during his first administration, McConnell has become a more vocal critic of the president as he faces retirement at the end of his term. ""I have some unfinished business to attend to,"" he said in a speech on the Senate floor that announced that his ""current term in the Senate will be my last"". In his speech, McConnell encouraged his fellow Senators to use their constitutional powers at a time when Trump has sought to greatly expand the reach of the presidency. McConnell has voted against Trump's appointments the most of all Senate Republicans by opposing Pete Hegseth for defense secretary, Tulsi Gabbard as director of national intelligence and Robert F Kennedy Jr for health secretary. He stressed that Congress is a co-equal branch of government to the president's, and it was a fundemental responsibility to confirm federal officials who ""possess authentic devotion to the rule of law above all else"". ""The weight of our power to advise and consent has never been lost on me,"" said McConnell, who had himself thwarted many a Democratic president's agenda in the legislative branch. At the end of his speech, senators and staff applauded and gave him a standing ovation. The Kentucky politician developed a reputation as a wily tactitian and perpetual thorn in the side of Democrats. Even when his party was in the minority, McConnell used arcane procedures and blunt political force to achieve sometimes seismic results. In one of his most stunning manoeuvres, he held up President Barack Obama's US Supreme Court nomination at the end of his second term. The blockade allowed an incoming president Trump to appoint a conservative judge instead, paving the way for a sweeping transformation of the nation's highest court. That, in turn, has led to the overturning of national abortion rights and a broad expansion of presidential immunity and power. McConnell also oversaw Trump's remaking of the federal judiciary, helping the president appoint a new slate of conservative judges across the US. But McConnell cooled significantly on the former president after the 6 January 2021 riot at the US Capitol, where McConnell and other lawmakers were swept into hiding from a violent mob. ""There's no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,"" McConnell said in a speech following the attack. Yet he did not vote to convict Trump on impeachment charges that stemmed from the riot. During the Biden administration, McConnell took a hawkish stance on Ukraine, becoming an outspoken advocate for US support even as Trump and his Maga base called for an insolationist response. While he was heavily criticised for bending and changing many of the Senate norms to push through his conservative agenda, the longtime Republican stressed the importance to respect the legislative body. ""I assure my colleagues I will depart with the great hope of the endurance - the endurance - of the Senate as an institution,"" McConnell said."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5d6dq44e7o,"Passengers on crashed Toronto plane offered US$30,000 each",2025-02-20T14:45:11.004Z,Jessica Murphy and James FitzGerald,"Delta Air Lines is offering US$30,000 (£23,792) to each person on board a plane that crash-landed in Toronto on Monday - all of whom survived. As it landed in the Canadian city, the plane skidded along the runway in flames before flipping over and coming to a halt upside down. Passengers described their amazement as most of them walked away without injuries. It remains unclear what caused the incident, which is under investigation. There were 76 passengers and four crew on the flight, which had travelled from the US city of Minneapolis before making its crash-landing in Canada. A spokesperson for Delta said the money offer had no strings attached and did not affect customers' rights. Toronto law firm Rochon Genova says it has been retained by certain passengers and their families over the crash-landing. Lawyer Vincent Genova said the group expected a ""timely and fair resolution"", highlighting that his clients ""suffered personal injuries of a serious nature that required hospital attention"". In an email to the BBC, Mr Genova said the $30,000 compensation is an ""advance"" payment meant to assist plane crash victims with short-term financial challenges, and the airline will seek to deduct it from any later settled claims. There is precedent to these types of payments, like in 2013, when Asiana Airlines offered passengers of a San Francisco plane crash $10,000 in initial compensation. Last year, Alaska Airlines offered a $1,500 cash payment to passengers after mid-air door-plug blowout on a flight from Portland. Following this week's incident in Toronto, the plane crew and emergency responders were praised for their quick work in removing people from the wrecked vehicle. The plane's various safety features have also been credited for ensuring no loss of life. All of the 21 passengers who were taken to hospital had been released by Thursday morning, the airline said. Delta's chief told the BBC's US partner CBS News that the flight crew were experienced and trained for any condition. The airline's head Ed Bastian told CBS the plane crew had ""performed heroically, but also as expected"", given that ""safety is embedded into our system"". He said Delta was continuing to support those affected. Several theories about what caused the crash have been suggested to the BBC by experts who reviewed footage, including that harsh winter weather and a rapid rate of descent played a role. One passenger recalled ""a very forceful event"", and the sound of ""concrete and metal"" at the moment of impact. Another said passengers were left hanging upside down in their seats ""like bats"". The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder have been recovered from the wreckage. The investigation is being led by Canada's Transportation Safety Board (TSB), supported by US officials. On Wednesday evening, the wreckage was removed from the airport runway. The accident was the fourth major air incident in North America in a space of three weeks - and was followed on Wednesday by a crash in Arizona in which two people lost their lives when their small planes collided. Experts continue to insist that air travel is overwhelmingly safe - more so than other forms of transport, in fact. That message was emphasised by US Secretary of Transportation Sean Duffy, who told CBS on Wednesday there was no pattern behind the incidents, each of which he said was ""very unique""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly4zw759plo,Two Texas teenage girls arrested for 'mass casualty attack' plot,2025-02-20T13:57:19.533Z,Madeline Halpert,"Two teenage girls in the US state of Texas have been arrested for plotting a ""mass casualty attack"" with pipe bombs and guns, police say. The girls, ages 15 and 16, were planning an attack at Memorial High School in a suburb of Houston, police told KHOU, an affiliate of the BBC's US partner CBS News. The plot - which was shared on social media - was detailed enough that officials deemed it to be credible, CBS reported. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) said its Threat Mitigation Team was involved in the response to help local police arrest the teenagers immediately. ""We are treating this matter with the utmost urgency and commitment, as threats of violence in our schools will not be tolerated,"" the Montgomery County Sheriff's Office said in a statement. A letter sent to Memorial High School families said police quickly arrested a student over a ""potentially credible threat in the planning stages identified on social media"". The school said it was implementing additional safety measures after the incident. The sheriff's office said one of the teenagers, a student at Willis High School in Conroe, Texas, was being held on unrelated charges, while the other, a student in the Spring Branch school district nearby, was in custody in a nearby county. Police have not named the two girls, as they are not adults. The students were arrested within 30 minutes of the FBI calling to notify the school about the threat, according to ABC News."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9845854nmno,"Rihanna unwavering in support, and other takeaways from A$AP Rocky trial",2025-02-20T04:02:47.211Z,Samantha Granville,"It was a trial that could have dismantled the future for one of hip-hop's hottest stars. The felony assault trial of A$AP Rocky - in which he was found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend - captured global headlines. There were outbursts during the proceedings and surprise visits in court by his longtime partner, singer Rihanna. Jurors in Los Angeles heard three weeks of testimony chronicling the bitter falling-out of childhood friends and the fight that led to the rapper, whose real name is Rakim Mayers, being charged on accusations he opened fire in the middle of a Hollywood street. After the rapper was acquitted, he left freely with singer Rihanna, who was seated behind him as the verdict was read. Here are five big things we learned while inside the courtroom. As the not guilty verdict was read in court, the rapper immediately jumped from the defence table and leapt over a wooden barrier to hug Rihanna, who was seated behind him in between his mother and sister. The couple embraced tightly, both breaking into tears as the courtroom erupted in cheers. Rihanna, a Grammy award-winning artist, was in court multiple days during the trial, including on Valentine's Day. On one of the days in court, she brought the couple's two young children, who were both dressed in suits with pacifiers in their mouths. You could hear them cooing inside the courtroom as they flipped through children's books. Joe Tacopina, the rapper's defence attorney, said Mr Mayers tried to shield Rihanna and their family from the criminal proceedings, but said that ""wild horses couldn't keep her away"" from the trial. Though she was often stoic and staring straight ahead while in court, she never flinched or showed emotion when prosecutors made negative comments about her partner. Following his acquittal, Rihanna expressed her gratitude on social media, stating, ""The glory belongs to God and God alone! Thankful, humbled by his mercy!"" The A$AP Mob is a hip-hop collective founded in 2006 in Harlem by a group of high school friends in New York. They adopted the ""A$AP"" title, which means ""Always Strive and Prosper"". The group, which has had more than 20 members over the years, have presented themselves as a family, but they've been plagued by jealousy, rivalries and disagreements since the death of its founder, A$AP Yams. Though there have been fallouts and issues between some members, this trial is the most notable instance of a complete dismantling of a relationship between members. A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron, was once a close friend and member of the Mob, accused Mr Mayers, known as A$AP Rocky, of shooting him during an altercation in 2021. During the trial, his defence team argued that Mr Ephron harboured resentment toward his former friend, feeling sidelined as A$AP Rocky's fame grew and saw mainstream musical success. They argued Mr Ephron was after money. Several members of the A$AP Mob testified during the trial in favour of Mr Mayers. A$AP Twelvyy challenged Mr Ephron's account of the events and suggested that he was the aggressor during the altercation, not Mr Mayers. A$AP Lou also took the stand, telling jurors that a Glock 43 magazine found during a search of Mr Mayers's home belonged to him, not the rapper. None of the A$AP members publicly testified for Relli. Do you know what AWGE stands for? If you know, I think both me and the jury would love to still know. During the trial, AWGE came up when A$AP Twelvyy was on the stand. He was asked by prosecutors about its meaning. But before he could answer, A$AP Rocky - who was seated with his attorneys - cut in and shouted, ""Don't say!"" Twelvvy abided and responded, ""I just know it's AWGE"". It was an astonishing moment. Criminal defendants don't typically say much during trials - let alone halt a witness from answering a question during their criminal trial. When asked about this exchange after the trial, A$AP Rocky's attorney Joe Tacopina explained what happened. He said it was an ""acronym for his company that had to do with his family. I'm gonna leave it at that."" Mr Tacopina went on to explain it was a private thing that the rapper didn't want revealed publicly to millions, especially in a criminal court case. But the answer really led to more questions. What does it mean and why is it so secretive? Here's what we do know: AWGE is the name of A$AP Rocky's mysterious creative collective and record label, and it's long been the subject of intrigue. Founded in 2014, the group operates across music, fashion and art, collaborating with brands like Mercedes-Benz and PacSun. Members include artists, designers and directors, and everyone remains loyal to one rule: no one publicly reveals what ""AWGE"" actually stands for. On the company's website there are two rules listed: ""#1 Never reveal what AWGE means. #2 When in doubt always refer to rule #1."" A$AP Rocky's fans do have some guesses though: Despite the guesses, the rapper and his team have never officially confirmed any meaning. Instead, they've leaned into the secrecy, with members often responding to questions about AWGE with the phrase, ""If you know, you know."" A$AP Rocky's trial unfolded at a pivotal moment in his career, with the rapper riding a wave of creative and commercial success. The rapper is set to release his first solo album in nearly a decade and is scheduled to co-headline Los Angeles' Rolling Loud festival in March 2025. Additionally, he is starring in a summer blockbuster alongside Denzel Washington. Director Spike Lee's upcoming film ""Highest 2 Lowest"" is slated for a summer release. But his influence extends beyond music—his AWGE collective has been collaborating with brands like Mercedes-Benz and Puma. He's been celebrated for his fashion sense, too, and is known as being one of music's best-dressed men. In May, he is set to co-chair the 2025 Met Gala - one of fashion's biggest nights - alongside big names like Anna Wintour, British race car driver Lewis Hamilton, singer Pharrell Williams and basketball superstar LeBron James. His relationship with Rihanna, one of the most famous singers, has further cemented his cultural relevance. The couple welcomed their second child, Riot Rose, in August 2023, and their growing family had become a symbol of hip-hop royalty. The trial wasn't just a battleground for the rapper's freedom—it also saw intense clashes between legal teams. Celebrity defence attorney Joe Tacopina, known for his aggressive courtroom style, relentlessly challenged the credibility of the prosecution's key witness, A$AP Relli, whose legal name is Terell Ephron. He painted Mr Ephron as an opportunist seeking financial gain and called the prosecution's case flimsy due to a lack of physical evidence. Mr Ephron got so fed up with the rapper's attorney during questioning that he called Mr Tacopina ""annoying"". Meanwhile, prosecutors pushed back, accusing Mr Tacopina of attempting to intimidate witnesses and dismiss key testimonies. Both sides were very liberal with their use of objections in court, and it sometimes felt as though both sides were trying to throw the other off their game, rather than being based on legal guidelines. It also got personal between the two sides. At one point during closing arguments, Mr Tacopina and prosecutor John Lewin traded misconduct allegations, with Mr Lewin accusing Mr Tacopina of using steroids and Mr Tacopina firing back by calling Lewin a ""hunchback"". After a short break, the judge attempted to lighten the mood by theatrically introducing the attorneys like boxers before resuming the trial."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vdnlmgyndo,Trump has vowed to end birthright citizenship. Can he do it?,2025-02-20T03:23:24.807Z,,"In one of his first acts as the 47th president of the United States, Donald Trump signed an executive order aimed at ending automatic citizenship rights for nearly anyone born on US territory - known as ""birthright citizenship"". It's a policy change he's long promised - but implementing it won't be easy. The matter looks likely to be decided by the US Supreme Court. Trump's order seeks to deny citizenship to the children of people who are either in the US illegally or on temporary visas. But it already has been blocked by courts in the early stages of what promises to be a long battle. Most legal scholars say the president doesn't have the power to unilaterally change the law in this area, which is based on an amendment in the US Constitution. The first sentence of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution establishes the principle of birthright citizenship: ""All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the state wherein they reside."" Immigration hardliners argue that the policy is a ""great magnet for illegal immigration"" and that it encourages pregnant women to cross the border in order to give birth and remain in the US, an act that has been pejoratively called ""birth tourism"" or having an ""anchor baby"". Supporters of birthright citizenship point out that it has been the law of the land for well over a century and that eliminating it would create a ""permanent subclass of people born in the US who are denied full rights as Americans."" The concept of birthright citizenship, also known by the legal term ""jus soli"", is based in English common law and was generally accepted to apply to white men throughout early American history. However, it did not become part of the Constitution until 1868, when the 14th Amendment was passed in the wake of the US Civil War in order to settle the question of the citizenship of freed, American-born former slaves. Previous Supreme Court cases, like Dred Scott v Sandford in 1857, had determined that African Americans could never be US citizens. The 14th Amendment overrode that. In 1898, the US Supreme Court ruled that birthright citizenship applies to the children of immigrants in the case of US v Wong Kim Ark. Wong was a 24-year-old child of legal Chinese immigrants who was born in the US, but denied re-entry when he returned from a visit to China. Wong successfully argued that because he was born in the US, his parents' immigration status did not affect the application of the 14th Amendment. The court ruled in Wong's favour and outlined a few limited exceptions to birthright citizenship, such as for children of diplomats. ""Wong Kim Ark vs United States affirmed that regardless of race or the immigration status of one's parents, all persons born in the United States were entitled to all of the rights that citizenship offered,"" writes Erika Lee, director of the Immigration History Research Center at the University of Minnesota. ""The court has not re-examined this issue since then."" Most legal scholars say President Trump cannot end birthright citizenship with an executive order. ""He's doing something that's going to upset a lot of people, but ultimately this will be decided by the courts,"" said Saikrishna Prakash, a constitutional expert and University of Virginia Law School professor. ""This is not something he can decide on his own."" Mr Prakash said that while the president can order employees of federal agencies to interpret citizenship more narrowly - agents with the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, for example - that would trigger legal challenges from anyone whose citizenship is denied. The Trump administration's arguments rest on the clause in the 14th Amendment that reads ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"". It argues that the language excludes children of non-citizens who are in the US unlawfully. Courts have generally disagreed. In Plyler v Doe, a 1982 Supreme Court case involving a different part of the 14th Amendment, justices rejected an argument made by the state of Texas that undocumented immigrants were not ""persons within its jurisdiction"". The court ruled that migrants are both subject to US laws and granted the protections afforded by them. A constitutional amendment could do away with birthright citizenship, but that would require a two-thirds vote in both the House of Representatives and the Senate and approval by three quarters of US states - a virtual impossibility on such a controversial proposal, given the current finely balanced divide in American politics. According to Pew Research, about 250,000 babies were born to unauthorised immigrant parents in the United States in 2016, which is a 36% decrease from a peak in 2007. By 2022, the latest year that data is available, there were 1.2 million US citizens born to unauthorised immigrant parents, Pew found. But as those children also have children, the cumulative effect of ending birthright citizenship could potentially increase the number of unauthorised immigrants in the country to 4.7m in 2050, the Migration Policy Institute, a think tank, found. In an interview with NBC's Meet the Press, Trump said he thought the children of unauthorised immigrants should be deported alongside their parents - even if they were born in the US. ""I don't want to be breaking up families,"" Trump said last December. ""So the only way you don't break up the family is you keep them together and you have to send them all back."" The case has now reached appellate court level and looks likely to end up at the conservative-dominated Supreme Court. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco has rejected the Trump administration's request to pause a lower-court judge's order. The appellate ruling upholds - for now - a nationwide injunction issued by a judge in Seattle at the behest of four Democratic-led states: Washington, Arizona, Illinois and Oregon. Seattle Judge John Coughenour called Trump's order ""blatantly unconstitutional"". Four federal judges have ruled against the policy - with one in Massachusetts writing that the Constitution ""leaves no room"" for Trump's interpretation of birthright citizenship. Judges in Maryland and New Hampshire have also blocked Trump's executive order. In the meantime, birthright citizenship remains the law of the land. More than 30 countries practise automatic ""jus soli"", or ""right of the soil"" without restriction in almost all cases. Other countries, like the UK and Australia, allow for a modified version where citizenship is automatically granted if one parent is a citizen or permanent resident."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62z31ng7l0o,Judge puts off decision on dropping charges against NY Mayor Adams,2025-02-20T01:16:42.237Z,Kayla Epstein,"Justice Department lawyers on Wednesday defended their decision to end a criminal case against New York City Mayor Eric Adams, facing tough questions from a judge about their rationale for the controversial move. Judge Dale Ho did not immediately rule on the motion to dismiss the charges, saying: ""I'm not going to shoot from the hip right here on the bench."" Last week, Emil Bove, a top official at the department and one of President Donald Trump's former personal attorneys, instructed federal prosecutors in Manhattan to drop the corruption case. Manhattan's lead prosecutor and six other high-level Justice officials resigned in protest, saying there was no legal justification for the directive. Bove's office later filed a motion to dismiss, prompting the judge to call a hearing. Adams has been charged with conspiracy, fraud, soliciting illegal campaign contributions, and bribery. He denies any wrongdoing. Often, judges sign off on dismissing charges from the bench at the end of a hearing, and the approval is typically viewed as routine. But this case has taken an unusual turn, with the former lead prosecutor, Danielle Sassoon, alleging the federal government is in a quid pro quo with the mayor of the largest city in the US. In his directive, Bove had said the mayor's legal situation ""restricted"" his ability to address ""illegal immigration and violent crime"" in New York City. Sassoon, the interim head of the Southern District of New York at the time, protested the decision in a letter to the US attorney general that soon became public. She alleged Adams had pledged to help enforce Trump's immigration policies in exchange for the case being dismissed. Adams has denied Sassoon's claim and called it ""silly."" Trump, meanwhile, has denied meddling in the mayor's case and Bove has denied a quid pro quo. The impact of the seven resignations has swept throughout New York City politics, energising a field of potential challengers to replace Adams. New York Governor Kathy Hochul is publicly weighing removing him from office before the upcoming city elections, as well. On his way in to court on Wednesday, Adams was met with dozens of protestors waving signs and chanting that he has ""got to go."" So many members of the public lined up to witness the hearing that the courthouse opened multiple overflow rooms. Judge Ho questioned both Bove and Adams attorney Alex Spiro in detail for more than an hour, after asking Adams a series of standard questions to ensure he understood the terms of the motion to dismiss - including that he could be prosecuted in the future. The judge pointedly asked if there had been ""anything promised to you to induce you to consent to the motion?"" ""Not at all,"" Adams answered. Bove shot back at Sassoon's allegations and argued thecase prevented Adams from doing his job. The mayor lost his security clearance during the prosecution, he said, and he could not receive necessary information about homeland security, immigration, and terrorism. But Judge Ho asked if Trump, as president, could simply restore Adams' security clearance. Bove conceded that he could. When Bove argued that the case, which was set to go to trial next month, could amount to election interference, because Adams ""can't campaign"", the judge paused and then said, with an audible exhalation, ""Okay"". Justice Ho has pledged to reach a timely resolution. It's unclear what would happen if he does not dismiss the charges, but Spiro said they could appeal against that ruling. After the hearing, Bove released a statement saying those in the department who did not support Trump's ""critical mission"" should resign. ""I went to New York today to show the men and women of the Justice Department as well as the American people that I am personally committed to our shared fight: ending weaponized government, stopping the invasion of criminal illegal aliens, and eliminating drug cartels and transnational gangs from our homeland,"" he said. Adams' indictment has embroiled his administration in scandal, with several city officials resigning. A Democrat, Adams has accused investigators of pursuing a case against him because of his criticism of former President Joe Biden's immigration policies. He has also expressed a willingness to work with Trump, and met Trump at his Florida home days before the Republican took office. Adams denied there was any discussion of his case."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjywvne2k9o,Trump administration moves to end New York City congestion charge,2025-02-19T23:10:23.231Z,Christal Hayes,"The Trump administration is moving to end New York City's congestion pricing plan, which charges vehicles entering the city in certain areas, then uses tolls to upgrade its aging transit systems. The Trump administration said the federal government has jurisdiction over highways leading into the city and is revoking its approval of the controversial program over concerns it unfairly burdens working-class residents in the region. ""CONGESTION PRICING IS DEAD,"" President Trump said on social media. ""Manhattan, and all of New York, is SAVED. LONG LIVE THE KING!"" New York, which launched the program just last month, is vowing to fight Trump, arguing the program is helping minimise traffic and travel times. ""We are a nation of laws, not ruled by a king,"" New York Gov Kathy Hochul said. ""We'll see you in court."" The program poses a $9 (£7.15) toll on vehicles entering Manhattan between 60th Street and the southern tip of the island in the Financial District. The toll is in place on weekdays from 5 am to 9 pm and on weekends from 9 am to 9 pm. New US Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy notified Gov Hochul that he was rescinding approval of the program and would work with officials to halt the tolls. He called the program a ""slap in the face to working class Americans"". ""Commuters using the highway system to enter New York City have already financed the construction and improvement of these highways through the payment of gas taxes and other taxes,"" he argued. ""The toll program leaves drivers without any free highway alternative, and instead, takes more money from working people to pay for a transit system and not highways. It's backwards and unfair."" New York officials vowed immediately to fight the Trump administration. Its transit agency, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority (MTA), on Wednesday asked a judge to make a declaratory judgement to prevent the administration from moving forward with plans to end the program. Hochul said the tolls will continue, and in a fiery speech at a subway station on Wednesday, said Trump was trying to take away the state's rights as part of his ""revenge tour."" ""New York hasn't laboured under a king in over 250 years and we sure as hell are not going to start now,"" Hochul said. ""This is an attack on our sovereign identity, our independence from Washington. We are a nation of states. This is what we fought for."" Hochul held up a photo posted earlier Wednesday by the official White House account on X, which showed Trump in a faux magazine cover wearing a crown, with the words, ""long live the king"". ""We are not subservient to a king or anyone else out of Washington,"" Hochul said. ""So this is the fight we're in. It's all about our sovereignty."" She and others at the news conference argued the new program lowered traffic by 9% during the month since it started. It's also cut traffic accidents in half and increased the use of other transportation, such as the city's subway system, she said. Transportation officials have argued the program would help relieve traffic in the city and help first responders trying to reach emergencies quickly. Money raised from the tolls would help bolster funds for its aging subways, which have garnered headlines over the years for massive underground floods during heavy rains. New Jersey's governor Phil Murphy sent a letter to Trump last month - the same day the president took office - asking him to assess the program and its impacts to his state. On Wednesday, he applauded the Trump administration for halting the program, saying in a statement that the program placed an unfair ""burden"" on commuters who work in the city. ""The current program lines the MTA's pockets at the expense of New Jerseyans,"" he said."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce98zeex9ymo,Two killed after small planes collide midair in Arizona,2025-02-19T22:48:01.748Z,Brajesh Upadhyay,"At least two people have died after two small planes collided midair near an airport in Arizona, police said. A Cessna 172S and a Lancair 360 MK II, both fixed-wing, single-engine aircraft, had two passengers each aboard when they collided at Marana Regional Airport, north-west of Tucson, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) said. The NTSB, which is leading the investigation into the incident, said on X that based on preliminary information, the aircraft ""collided while upwind of runway 12"", which is one of two runways at the airport. It added that the Cessna ""landed uneventfully"" while the Lancair ""impacted terrain near runway 3 and a post-impact fire ensued."" No information about the victims was provided. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) said the two planes collided at around 08:25 local time (15:25GMT) on Wednesday. ""Two people were on board the Lancair and two people were on board the Cessna 172,"" the statement said. Marana Regional Airport is an ""uncontrolled field"", meaning it does not have an operating air traffic control tower. Pilots often use a Common Traffic Advisory Frequency to announce their position to other pilots who are in the airport vicinity. The deadly collision follows a recent string of aviation related incidents. Last month a helicopter collided with an American Airlines passenger plane in Washington DC, killing all 64 passengers and three crew members. The same week, a small medical transport plane crashed into several buildings in the US city of Philadelphia, killing all six people on board and at least one other person on the ground. On Monday, a Delta Air Lines flight in Toronto skidded along the runway in flames before flipping over and coming to a dramatic halt upside down. All 80 people on board survived. The latest crash comes as the US aviation sector on Wednesday called on Congress for emergency funding for air traffic control technology and staffing."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04z90607v4o,US man dies awaiting sentencing for shooting teen Ralph Yarl,2025-02-19T22:25:58.578Z,,"A Missouri man has died weeks before his sentencing for shooting a 16-year-old boy who accidentally went to the wrong address. Andrew Lester, 86, pleaded guilty last week to second-degree assault after opening fire on Ralph Yarl in Kansas City on 13 April 2023. Lester was scheduled for sentencing on 7 March and was facing seven years in prison. In a statement, the Yarl family expressed frustration that ""justice was never truly served"". Ralph Yarl rang Lester's doorbell while going to pick up his younger brothers. Prosecutors said Lester shot the teen without speaking to him. The boy survived and has since graduated from high school. The Clay County prosecutor's office said in a statement on Wednesday: ""We have learned of the passing of Andrew Lester and extend our sincere condolences to his family during this difficult time. ""While the legal proceedings have now concluded, we acknowledge that Mr Lester did take responsibility for his actions by pleading guilty in this case. ""Our thoughts remain with both families affected by this tragic incident as they continue their healing process."" But in a statement to the Kansas City Star, the Yarl family expressed dissatisfaction that ""the man responsible escaped sentencing"". They added: ""One of the reasons we pushed for a speedy trial was to ensure the public would see that our society does not condone shooting an unarmed, innocent child simply for ringing the wrong doorbell - especially when that child was targeted because of the color of his skin."" Police initially said there was a ""racial component"" to the shooting, but authorities ultimately did not charge Lester with a hate crime. Lester and his lawyers said he was acting in self-defence and thought the teenager was trying to break into his home. Ralph Yarl told authorities his mother sent him to pick up his siblings from a playdate at around 22:00 local time that night. He mixed up similar street names - Northeast 115 Street and Northeast 115th Terrace - which put him on Lester's doorstep and about a block away from the house he was trying to find. After he rang the doorbell, Lester shot him twice - once in the forehead and once in the arm. Prosecutors have said the boy ""did not cross the threshold"" of Lester's home and survived after fleeing to neighbouring homes for help. Police initially detained Lester for questioning and released him without charges, sparking protests in Kansas City. The demonstrations drew support from celebrities including actresses Halle Berry, Kerry Washington and Jennifer Hudson. Lester turned himself in after an arrest warrant was issued. The case was one of several in spring 2023 in which Americans were injured after minor mistakes resulted in gun violence. One of the victims, 20-year-old Kaylin Gillis, was fatally shot after a car she was in pulled into the wrong driveway in upstate New York."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7x63685p2o,Canada trucker protests organiser gets three-months house arrest,2025-02-19T17:57:00.991Z,Jessica Murphy,"A key organiser behind the ""Freedom Convoy"" trucker protests that gridlocked Canada's capital for weeks in 2022, has been sentenced to three months of house arrest. Pat King, 47, was convicted in November on five of nine criminal charges: mischief, counselling to commit mischief, counselling to obstruct a public or peace officer, and two counts of disobeying a court order. In his Wednesday sentencing, an Ontario Superior Court judge gave King nine months credit for time already spent behind bars. Prosecutors had asked for a 10-year sentence. King was part of a group that led a convoy of trucks to Ottawa during the pandemic to protest against Covid-19 measures. Speaking outside the courthouse on Wednesday, King's lawyer Natasha Calvinho called the sentencing decision ""balanced"". ""This is an end to a very long and very drawn out process,"" she said. As part of the conditional sentence, King will also have a period of probation after his release from house arrest, which he will serve in his home province of Alberta. The trucker protests received international attention in 2022 and inspired similar copycat demonstrations abroad. King is the first organiser of the Freedom Convoy to be convicted and sentenced. Two other organisers, Tamara Lich and Chris Barber, will learn the outcome of their trial next month. King's lawyers argued during his trial that he was part of a peaceful demonstration against public health restrictions and government mandates, and that police were to blame for rising tensions during the protest. Crown prosecutors argued that he was a key figure behind the protests, which they say had disrupted and harmed the residents and workers of downtown Ottawa for weeks. The February 2022 protests were initially sparked by a federal vaccine mandate for truck drivers crossing the US-Canada border. Convoys of some 400 heavy trucks and other vehicles descended on Ottawa and blockaded city streets around parliament for three weeks. They were stopped after Prime Minister Trudeau enacted the never-before-used Emergencies Act, which allowed police to clear the streets and freeze the bank accounts of protesters. King was arrested shortly after on 18 February and was released on bail five months later. He was ordered back behind bars briefly after he breached court-imposed rules on his social media use."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2dnnvvjkeo,"Why did a plane crash in Toronto, and how did everyone survive?",2025-02-19T14:16:47.767Z,James FitzGerald,"Passengers have described their amazement after most of them escaped unscathed from a plane that crash landed in Toronto on Monday afternoon. The Delta flight skidded along the runway in flames before flipping over and coming to a dramatic halt upside down, losing its tail and an entire wing in the process. Some of the 80 people on board were then left hanging upside down while still strapped to their seats, before they scrambled over luggage to escape onto the snowy runway. No-one died in the incident, which is under investigation. Analysts have suggested the harsh winter weather may be to blame, or that the plane landed badly. They have also credited the plane's safety features with saving lives. The incident took place shortly after 14:00 local time on Monday (19:00 GMT). It involved a model CRJ-900 plane, operating as Delta Air Lines flight DL4819. The aircraft arrived at Toronto from the US city of Minneapolis and was carrying 76 passengers and four crew members. As it landed, the plane appears to have struck the runway, slid for some distance and then flipped over, observed Dan Ronan, a journalist and pilot licensed by the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), who spoke to BBC News. In a video statement released on Tuesday, Transportation Safety Board senior investigator Ken Webster said that after the initial impact parts of the aircraft separated. The fuselage came to rest slightly off the right side of the runway, upside down and facing the other direction, he said. Footage obtained by TMZ showed part of the aircraft bursting into flames as the landing happened. Firefighters rushed to put these out. Passenger Pete Carlson told broadcaster CBC it was ""a very forceful event"", recalling the sound of ""concrete and metal"" at the moment of impact. He and others on board were suspended upside down in their seats, and had to release themselves on to the cabin ceiling before leaving the inverted aircraft. All 80 people on board survived. On Tuesday morning, Delta said 21 injured passengers were initially transported to local hospitals - with 19 later released. Delta has promised to give more updates. Mr Webster said investigators have recovered the cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder from the wreckage as part of their investigation. BBC Verify has analysed recordings of communications between the plane and air traffic control. At no point in discussions was there anything to suggest trouble was anticipated with the landing. This was confirmed by Marco Chan, a former pilot and a senior lecturer at Buckinghamshire New University in the UK, and plane crash investigator Ismo Aaltonen, who also listened to the audio recording. Mr Chan also said the plane appeared to have made a hard landing - involving an unusually high rate of descent. It seems to have touched down with one wheel first, Mr Chan told the BBC, which might have caused the landing gear to collapse on impact. This could have led to the right wing hitting the runway and in turn causing the plane to roll. The weather may also have been significant. The airport fire chief stated that the runway was dry at the time of the incident. Airport authorities had said earlier that although recent heavy snow had stopped, ""frigid temperatures and high winds [were] moving in"". As the plane came in to land, air traffic controllers told the pilots of 38mph (61km/h) gusts and the possibility of a ""slight bump in the glide path"", CNN reported. The pilots appear to have attempted what is known as a crab manoeuvre, Mr Ronan said. This involves turning a plane into the wind, and then directly on to the runway at the last moment. ""The sheer survivability of this is really amazing,"" Mr Ronan told the BBC, pointing out that the aeroplane's fuselage (body) had stayed intact. Other commentators hailed the craft's safety features. CNN analyst and former FAA inspector David Soucie said the plane had broken apart as it had meant to, with the detachment of the wings stopping the fuselage ripping apart. Graham Braithwaite, professor of safety and accident investigation at the UK's Cranfield University, said planes were also designed so that passengers involved in an accident did not hit things likely to cause injury. ""Even the design of the seat back or the tray table is all part of how we consider making that survivable space,"" he told the BBC. ""And the seatbelt that people have is so important - that is the ultimate thing that stops people being thrown around the cabin like this,"" he added. The flight attendants have also been praised for getting everyone off the flipped aeroplane quickly. Emergency crews on the ground were labelled ""heroic"" by the airport chief after reaching the crash site in a matter of minutes. Mr Carlson said the passengers themselves had worked together very effectively. ""What I saw was everyone on that plane suddenly became very close in terms of how to help one another, how to console one another,"" he said. Mr Ronan highlighted the importance of the plane's high-impact 16g seats, which he said were ""designed to absorb a great deal of punishment"". The seats can withstand deceleration of 16 times the force of gravity, and must pass rigorous testing using human dummies to model crash dynamics. The seat legs, attached to a track on the floor, must be able to pitch down 10 degrees on one side and roll 10 degrees on the other side so that they do not break, said Kevin Campbell, founder of Aviation Consulting & Engineering Solutions, who is FAA-authorised to approve seats that are required to comply with the regulations. In previous accidents, the FAA had seen seats piled up in the fronts of aircrafts, with bodies still attached in many cases, Mr Campbell said. Mr Ronan said the regulations keep ""the seat in place and bolted to the floor, so you have a higher degree of survivability in your seat itself and you have less likelihood that the seat is going to become detached, where you're now strapped into a moving object that's being bounced around the cabin"". The regulations also require a passenger to be able to withstand hitting their head and legs on the seat in front of them, and seats help absorb weight in their spine so that they do not break their back. Seatbelts are also less stretchy than they used to be so the restraint is more secure. ""As a result of that aircrafts are much, much safer,"" Mr Campbell said, and those factors were ""absolutely"" at play in improving safety in this crash. ""It really is remarkable that the seats did exactly what they were supposed to do, they stayed intact... the seatbelts worked just as they were supposed to, and the seats did not become detached from the floor,"" Mr Ronan said. ""Think of how many head injuries we would have had, spinal injuries we would have had, if the seat became detached."" This marks the fourth major air crash in North America in less than a month, and other recent incidents remain under investigation. Those incidents followed another high-profile crash in South Korea in December, in which 179 people were killed. Despite these, experts say air travel remains overwhelmingly safe - and increasingly so. Additional reporting by Mallory Moench, Tom Joyner and Josh Cheetham"

Krystena Murray, from the state of Georgia, became pregnant after IVF treatment at the Coastal Fertility clinic in May 2023. But it became clear that the embryo she had been carrying in fact belonged to another couple - after Ms Murray gave birth to a boy who was of a different ethnicity to both her and the sperm donor she had chosen. Despite the error, Ms Murray wanted to keep the child, and raised the baby for several months until the biological parents were granted custody. In a statement released through her lawyer, Ms Murray said: ""To carry a baby, fall in love with him, deliver him, and build the uniquely special bond between mother and baby, all to have him taken away. I'll never fully recover from this."" Ms Murray, a white woman, gave birth to a black baby in December 2023. She never posted photos of the child online or allowed her friends and family to see him. She eventually purchased an at-home DNA kit, and the test results she received in late January 2024 confirmed they were not biologically related, according to the complaint filed against the clinic. She informed the clinic about the mix-up the following month. It alerted the biological parents, who sued for custody when the baby was three months old. Ms Murray voluntarily gave up custody after being told by her legal team she stood no chance of winning in family court. The baby now lives with his biological parents in another state under a different name. The complaint says to this day Ms Murray does not know whether the clinic, Coastal Fertility Specialists, mistakenly transferred her embryo to a different couple, or what might have happened to it afterwards. In a statement to CBS News, the BBC's US partner, Coastal Fertility acknowledged the mistake and apologised for the distress that was caused. ""This was an isolated event with no further patients affected,"" the statement said. ""The same day this error was discovered we immediately conducted an in-depth review and put additional safeguards in place to further protect patients and to ensure that such an incident does not happen again."" There have been several lawsuits in recent years brought against US fertility clinics over IVF mix-ups. IVF is a procedure during which a woman's eggs are fertilised by a man's sperm in a laboratory before the embryos are implanted into a woman's uterus."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjev24184vjo,Trump administration trying to rehire USDA bird flu officials it fired,2025-02-19T13:06:36.980Z,Madeline Halpert,"US President Donald Trump's administration is attempting to rehire officials with the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) who worked on the government response to bird flu before being fired over the weekend, US media report. The layoffs were a part of a cost-cutting mission across the US government by Trump and his Department of Government Efficiency (Doge) leader Elon Musk. The terminations came as the latest outbreak of the bird flu has wreaked havoc on poultry and cattle farms, causing egg prices to skyrocket and raising concerns among public health experts. A USDA spokesperson told the BBC that although ""several"" officials working on bird flu were ""notified of their terminations"" over the weekend, ""we are working to swiftly rectify the situation and rescind those letters"". ""USDA's Food Safety and Inspection Service frontline positions are considered public safety positions, and we are continuing to hire the workforce necessary to ensure the safety and adequate supply of food to fulfil our statutory mission,"" the spokesperson added. Bird flu has circulated among American poultry flocks for years, but the virus found a new foothold in the US last year when it began to infect dairy cows. Since then, dozens of humans in close contact with the animals have been infected as well, including a Louisiana patient who was the first to die from the virus in the US last month. At the same time, the outbreak has worsened on poultry farms, forcing farmers to cull their chickens, leading to egg shortages and high prices. Earlier this week, the US reached an agreement to buy 15,000 tonnes of liquid egg from Turkey to help plug the shortage, a Turkish trade official told the BBC. Ibrahim Afyon, the president of the Egg Producers Central Union in Turkey, said the egg products would be sent to the US in two batches by the end of June. Trump launched his mass cost-cutting programme in an effort to weed out what he sees as taxpayers' money being wasted. Polling suggests cutting government spending has widespread support. But the USDA firings are not the first time the administration has attempted to rehire federal employees within days of laying them off. After firing officials with the National Nuclear Security Administration last week, US media reported that the government was trying to reinstate some of those employees, but was struggling to get in contact with them. The layoffs were in addition to an estimated 75,000 workers who have accepted buyout offers from the White House to leave voluntarily. Several Democratic states have filed lawsuits attempting to block some of these mass government layoffs as well as the newly formed Doge's access to sensitive data. But in a victory for Trump and Musk, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan rejected one of these requests on Tuesday, arguing Democratic states had failed to link Trump's layoffs to ""imminent harm"" in their states. Trump and Musk appeared on Fox News on Tuesday night to defend the mass cuts they are making across the government, with Musk claiming Doge is just trying to ""restore the will of the people through the president"". ""What we're finding is that there's an unelected bureaucracy,"" he said. Additional reporting by Zeynep Erdim"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0qz32wzeego,When is Sean 'Diddy' Combs' trial and what is he charged with?,2025-02-19T11:08:26.998Z,Brandon Drenon,"Sean ""Diddy"" Combs, one of the most successful rappers and music moguls in the US, will soon be on trial for sex trafficking and racketeering charges. He also faces dozens of lawsuits from individuals who say they were harmed and exploited by the rapper through drugs, alcohol and physical abuse. Mr Combs has pleaded not guilty to the criminal charges and rejected the accusations in the individual lawsuits, calling them attempts ""for a quick payday"". If convicted, he faces up to life in prison on the racketeering charge and a minimum of 15 years for sex trafficking. Mr Combs - who has also gone by the names Puffy, Puff Daddy, P Diddy, Love, and Brother Love - emerged into the hip-hop scene in the 1990s. His early music career success included helping launch the careers of Mary J Blige and Christopher Wallace - aka Biggie Smalls, or the Notorious B.I.G. His music label Bad Boy Records soon became one of the most important labels in rap and expanded to include Faith Evans, Ma$e, 112, Mariah Carey and Jennifer Lopez. Mr Combs also had a prolific business career outside of music, most notably, signing a deal with British drinks company Diageo in 2007 to promote the French vodka brand, Cîroc, in the US. In 2023, he released his fifth record The Love Album: Off The Grid and earned his first solo nomination at the Grammy awards. He also was named a Global Icon at the MTV Awards that year. In the federal criminal case, Mr Combs is charged with racketeering conspiracy, sex trafficking and transportation to engage in prostitution. He is accused of kidnapping, drugging and coercing women into sexual activities, sometimes by using firearms or threatening them with violence. In a raid on his Los Angeles mansion, police found supplies that they said were intended for use in orgies known as “freak offs”, including drugs and more than 1,000 bottles of baby oil. Separately, Mr Combs faces a number of lawsuits accusing him of rape and assault. Tony Buzbee, a Texas lawyer handling some of these cases, said that more than 100 women and men from across the US have either filed lawsuits against the rap mogul or will do so. In December 2023, a woman known in court papers as Jane Doe alleged that she was ""gang raped"" by Mr Combs and others in 2003, when she was 17. She said she was given ""copious amounts of drugs and alcohol"" before the attack. Mr Combs' legal team dismissed the flurry of lawsuits as ""clear attempts to garner publicity."" His current legal issues began when he was sued by his ex-girlfriend Casandra Ventura, also known as Cassie, in late 2023. She accused him of violently abusing and raping her. That lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount a day after it was filed, with Mr Combs maintaining his innocence. Since then, multiple women have filed lawsuits accusing Mr Combs of sexual assault, with accusations dating back to 1991. He denies all claims. His controversial history with Ms Ventura resurfaced in 2024, when CCTV footage leaked by CNN showed Mr Combs kicking his former girlfriend as she lay on a hotel hallway floor in 2016. He apologised for his behaviour shortly afterwards, saying: ""I take full responsibility for my actions in that video. I was disgusted then when I did it. I'm disgusted now."" Mr Combs has consistently denied the allegations made against him in the civil lawsuits, and has previously labelled them as ""sickening"" – suggesting they were ""made against me by individuals looking for a quick payday"". In a statement issued at the start of February - in response to a claim from a lawyer that he would face more than 10 more civil lawsuits - Diddy's own lawyer restated that his client was innocent. In a statement to the BBC in response to the federal criminal charges, his lawyer said: ""Mr Combs and his legal team have full confidence in the facts and the integrity of the judicial process. ""In court, the truth will prevail: that Mr Combs never sexually assaulted or trafficked anyone - man or woman, adult or minor."" Diddy's lawyers later filed a motion to dismiss an aspect of the federal indictment in which he is accused of ""transportation to engage in prostitution"". His team argued he was being unfairly targeted due to his race. Mr Combs has been held at the Metropolitan Detention Center in Brooklyn, New York since his arrest on 16 September 2024. His lawyers have argued for his release in the run-up to the trial, citing the jail’s “horrific” conditions. Critics describe the prison as overcrowded and understaffed, and describe a culture of widespread violence. A New York federal judge denied the request for bail, arguing that Mr Combs was a “serious flight risk”. Prosecutors have alleged that Mr Combs has been breaking prison rules by contacting potential witnesses ahead of the sex trafficking trial. They accuse him of ""relentless efforts"" to ""corruptly influence witness testimony"". US District Judge Arun Subramanian ruled his trial will begin on 5 May. Prosecutor Emily Johnson told the judge that the government will need three weeks to present its case. Defence lawyer Marc Agnifilo said the rapper's team will need a week for theirs. Mr Combs' trial - scheduled to take place at the Daniel Patrick Moynihan courthouse in New York City - is expected to be public. All of Mr Combs' court proceedings thus far have been open to the media and the public, but not livestreamed. Most federal courts do not allow cameras or electronics in the courtroom. Mr Combs faces up to life in prison if convicted on the racketeering charge. He faces another statutory minimum sentence of 15 years if he is found guilty of the sex trafficking charge."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2qepd3yn8o,A$AP Rocky not guilty of firearm assault on LA street,2025-02-19T06:53:33.316Z,Samantha Granville,"Rapper A$AP Rocky has been found not guilty of firing a gun at a former friend. A jury in Los Angeles acquitted the musician, whose legal name is Rakim Mayers, on two felony assault charges that carried up to 24 years in prison. Terell Ephron claimed the Grammy-nominated hip-hop star opened fire at him during an argument on a Hollywood street on 6 November 2021, grazing his knuckles with one of the shots. Mr Mayers, who is also a fashion mogul and the longtime partner of pop star Rihanna, denied the charges, arguing that the weapon was a prop gun and that his former friend, who calls himself A$AP Relli, was only after money. As the first not-guilty verdict was read on Tuesday, the court rang with screams and clapping. Mr Mayers rushed towards his family and Rihanna, who were seated behind him. He dived over a wooden barrier to embrace them. Rihanna had been a repeated presence in court during the trial, and for Tuesday's verdict, brought along their two sons, two-year-old RZA and one-year-old Riot. Mr Mayers also hugged his lawyers and appeared to have tears in his eyes as the second not-guilty verdict was read. ""Thank God for saving my life,"" Mr Mayers said aloud. He thanked members of the 12-person jury. The rapper was arrested on the two felony assault charges after a heated argument with his former friend in the heart of Hollywood. Mr Mayers and Mr Ephron have known each other since high school in New York and were part of the A$AP Mob hip-hop collective. Their friendship cooled as A$AP Rocky's career took off. Authorities said Mr Ephron met Mr Mayers on 6 November 2021, a day after the pair had a disagreement, outside a hotel about a block from the iconic Hollywood Walk of Fame.  An altercation ensued. Mr Mayers was alleged to have pulled out a gun from his waistband and pointed it at Mr Ephron, telling him: ""I'll kill you right now."" ""He looked me in my eyes and pointed the gun at me,"" Mr Ephron testified. Mr Ephron said he told the rapper to fire the weapon, but Mr Mayers started walking away. As he left, Mr Ephron followed, shouting at him. Prosecutors alleged that at this point, Mr Mayers once again pulled out the gun and fired multiple shots, with one bullet said to have grazed Mr Ephron's knuckles. Much of the trial hinged on whether the firearm in question was a harmless prop gun, as Mr Mayers's defence said, or a real weapon capable of causing harm, as Mr Ephron and prosecutors alleged. The weapon has not been recovered by authorities. Jurors were able to watch some footage of the altercation because parts were captured on surveillance video, including audio of gunfire, but no video evidence directly showed any shooting. Mr Ephron took two days before reporting the incident to authorities and brought shell casings he said he had retrieved from the scene. But police who responded to reports of a shooting in the area did not locate any shell casings. Mr Ephron, who said he returned with his girlfriend hours later, said he knew exactly where to look, but no surveillance footage corroborates his account. He was not admitted to hospital in Los Angeles and instead went for medical treatment after flying back to New York. Lawyers for Mr Mayers suggested that Mr Ephron had planted the shell casings to frame the rapper. The trial was marked by emotional and combative exchanges, particularly when Mr Ephron - the trial's star witness - took the stand. At one point, Mr Ephron called Mr Tacopina - a defence attorney for Mr Mayers - ""annoying"", which led to a reprimand from the judge. Another witness, A$AP Twelvyy, was asked by prosecutors about a photograph showing Mr Mayers's bed with the letters ""AWGE"" emblazoned on the furniture. When asked what that stood for, Mr Mayers unexpectedly interrupted the proceedings and yelled, ""Don't say!"" Twelvyy ultimately refused to elaborate. Outbursts from defendants during trials are uncommon, especially in front of a jury. However, for a criminal suspect on trial to interject and instruct a witness not to answer a prosecutor's question during cross-examination is something nearly unheard of in a court. The rapper is set to release his first solo album in nearly a decade and is scheduled to co-headline Los Angeles' Rolling Loud festival in March 2025. Additionally, he stars alongside Denzel Washington in Spike Lee's upcoming film Highest 2 Lowest, due to be released the coming months."

Sir Sadiq Khan hopes that altering the famous shopping street will increase visitor numbers, create jobs, and boost growth for London. The consultation is the mayor's latest attempt to change the street; his attempt in 2018 was blocked by the then Conservative-run local authority. Last year following the general election, the Labour government gave the mayor planning powers to create a Mayoral Development Corporation (MDC) around Oxford Street, allowing him to take control of the area away from Westminster City Council. The exact boundaries of the proposed area have not yet been announced as the MDC's formation is part of the consultation. Sir Sadiq said: ""Oxford Street has been known as the nation's high street but the area has suffered in recent years. ""My proposals are designed to unlock the true potential of Oxford Street and deliver a world-class, accessible, clean, avenue. ""These proposals would help to restore this famous part of the capital and support good businesses, while creating new jobs and boosting growth."" Karim Fatehi, CEO of the London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, urged businesses to participate in the consultation. Adam Hug, leader of Westminster Council, said: ""Subject to the outcome of the mayor's consultation, our role is to ensure that the mayor's proposed Oxford Street transformation delivers for local communities, as well as for London. ""We have already fought hard to secure numerous improvements from the mayor of London to ensure that any plans for Oxford Street are deliverable and meet the needs of local residents, businesses, and wider London."" Dee Corsi, chief executive at New West End Company, a partnership of businesses and property owners in the West End, said: ""We have long championed the regeneration of Oxford Street, recognising its vital importance to London and the UK economy. ""The launch of the public consultation marks a significant milestone in the journey of the nation's high street."" But one London cabbie told BBC London pedestrianisation would be a ""nightmare for drivers"". ""Being a cab driver 26 years this year, Khan is just shutting down London,"" she said. ""He's not thinking about disabled people or anybody that just wants to get in a cab to get home. From a cab driver's point of view, it's very negative. ""From a pedestrian's point of view, it's a win, because it's safe."" An Oxford Street shopper said pedestrianisation ""would make it so much easier for shopping"", while another said it would be a ""bonus"" if it stopped cyclists from using the road. Londoners can have their say on proposals until 2 May. Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on Facebook, X and Instagram.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-64125045,Who is Andrew Tate? The self-proclaimed misogynist influencer,2025-02-27T18:28:03.000Z,,"The controversial British-American influencer Andrew Tate has left Romania, where he was charged with rape, human trafficking and forming an organised crime group to sexually exploit women. He and his brother are believed to be on a private jet heading to the US, sources told the BBC. Tate was put under house arrest in Romania in August 2024 when prosecutors launched a second criminal investigation against himself and his brother Tristan, as well as four other suspects. They all deny wrongdoing. Separately, the brothers are wanted in the UK to face allegations of sexual assault which they also deny. The brothers have also been accused of tax evasion in the UK. A British court ruled in December 2024 that police could seize more than £2m ($2.4m) from them for failing to pay tax on £21m in revenue from their online businesses. Andrew Tate said the ruling was ""not justice"" and called it a ""co-ordinated attack"". Warning: Contains references to sexual violence. Self-proclaimed ""misogynist"" Andrew Tate first rose to fame after an appearance on the British version of reality TV show Big Brother in 2016. He only lasted six days on the programme, before being removed following the emergence of a video that appeared to show him attacking a woman. He said at the time that the footage had been edited and was ""a total lie trying to make me look bad"". Now, the 38-year-old former kickboxer boasts more than 10 million followers on X, formerly Twitter - and a worldwide profile. Tate - full name Emory Andrew Tate - was born in December 1986. He is named after his father, an American who worked for the US Air Force in Britain, and who was also a chess master. His mother and father met in the UK before moving to America where Tate was raised until his parents divorced. Following the divorce, Tate moved to Luton, England, with his mother. Both Tate and his younger brother Tristan said they experienced poverty in England. In interviews, they recalled going to KFC to save other people's leftover chicken and freezing it for future meals. Tate was a kickboxing world champion four times - but it was online where he found worldwide fame. Tate has appeared in countless videos, flaunting an ultra-luxurious lifestyle of fast cars, private jets, and yachts. Shortly before he was first arrested in December 2022, he engaged in a row with environmental activist Greta Thunberg on Twitter. He claimed to have 33 cars and said he would send her a list of their ""respective enormous emissions"". On TikTok, videos with the #AndrewTate hashtag have been viewed billions of times. That figure also includes videos made by people criticising the influencer. In an interview with another YouTuber, he said he was ""absolutely a misogynist"", and added: ""I'm a realist and when you're a realist, you're sexist. There's no way you can be rooted in reality and not be sexist."" In that same video, he described women as ""intrinsically lazy"" and said there was ""no such thing as an independent female"". Andrew Tate has been singled out for the effect he has had in spreading misogyny online among boys and young men by authorities in the UK. Speaking at the launch of a report into violence against women and girls in July 2024, Deputy Chief Constable Maggie Blyth said: ""We know that some of this is also linked to radicalisation of young people online, we know the influencers, Andrew Tate, the element of influencing of particularly boys, is quite terrifying."" The report stated that police were now working with counter-terrorism teams to combat the risks of young men being radicalised. Numerous social media platforms, including YouTube, Facebook, Instagram and TikTok, have banned him - with the latter saying that ""misogyny is a hateful ideology that is not tolerated"". Tate was banned from Twitter for saying women should ""bear responsibility"" for being sexually assaulted. He has since been reinstated on the platform, now known as X. In the past, Tate has used extreme language relating to acts of violence against women. In a text seen by BBC Panorama, he wrote to one woman: ""I love raping you"". In a combative interview with the BBC in June 2023, when pushed on whether his controversial views on women harmed young people, the influencer claimed he was a ""force for good"" and that he was ""acting under the instruction of God to do good things"". Andrew Tate and his brother face a number of civic and criminal legal cases. Tate was detained alongside his brother Tristan in December 2022 in a suburb of the Romanian capital, Bucharest, as part of an investigation into allegations of human trafficking and rape, which they deny. The pair were charged along with two Romanian female suspects in June 2023. In response to the charges against them, the media team for the Tate brothers said: ""While this news is undoubtedly predictable, we embrace the opportunity it presents to demonstrate their innocence and vindicate their reputation."" In December 2023, the Tate brothers were ordered not to leave Romania after they made a request to visit their mother in hospital in the UK. A Romanian court ruled in early July 2024 that Tate and his brother could leave the country but had to stay within the European Union. This decision was opposed by prosecutors, and overturned less than two weeks later by the Bucharest Court of Appeal. In March 2024, British police investigating Andrew Tate on allegations of rape and human trafficking were granted a warrant to extradite him and his brother to the UK. Separately, in May 2024, lawyers for four women who claim they were assaulted by Tate and his brother said they were bringing a civil case against him at the High Court in the UK for ""damages for injuries they suffered as a result"". A representative for the Tate brothers said in response that they ""unequivocally deny all allegations"". Another legal issue facing the pair in the UK is a civil case brought in July 2024 by Devon and Cornwall Police, in which they are accused of failing to pay any tax on £21m of revenue from their online businesses, including online ""wealth creation"" platform Hustlers' University. A third person known only as J is also accused as part of the case, with the force seeking to recover about £2.8 million held in seven frozen bank accounts, an application which the defendants are contesting. Tate has described himself as a ""self-made multi-millionaire"" and said he earned money through ""a little webcam business from my apartment"". ""I had 75 women working for me in four locations and I was doing $600,000 a month from webcam,"" he said in a podcast interview. In a now-deleted page on his website, he said he brought women into the ""adult entertainment industry"". ""My job was to meet a girl, go on a few dates, sleep with her, test if she's quality, get her to fall in love with me to where she'd do anything I say and then get her on webcam so we could become rich together,"" he wrote on the page - which was subsequently taken down in February 2022. Tate works alongside his brother, Tristan, who told the Daily Mirror that their business was ""all a big scam"" which saw men pay to talk to women online. ""I've seen men sell cars, TVs... This guy's gran passed away and they were waiting for the sale of the house. When the house was sold he'd get £20,000 and promised it to [a model], to pay for her fake financial problem,"" Tristan told the Mirror."

A Jump Air flight from Southampton was on the approach to Guernsey Airport in August when it descended below the minimum height allowed during poor visibility. The report by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) found there was confusion between the pilot and co-pilot which resulted in delays to the plane making a climb. It then diverted and landed safely back at Southampton Airport. The AAIB said the operator had taken a number of safety actions since the incident. Guernsey airline Aurigny said the flight was being operated by Jump Air - an aircraft, crew, maintenance and insurance (ACMI) or ""wet lease"" provider. A spokesman said this was commonplace and typically used by airlines to increase capacity during peak periods or when its fleet capacity is impacted. It added: ""We are encouraged by the report findings that Jump Air has implemented a number of changes since the incident. ""We are very glad all those involved are safe and the safety and welfare of our customers and crew is always our priority.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwynnj58414o,Manx ferry chartered to Channel Islands for a year,2025-02-27T16:32:30.427Z,Ashlea Tracey,"Manx back-up freight vessel MV Arrow will operate a year-long charter in the Channel Islands, the government-owned ferry firm has confirmed. Isle of Man Steam Packet Company said the agreement would come into force on 24 March, after the return of the Ben-my-Chree from dry dock. The Steam Packet said the vessel would undergo port trials and pilotage training before entering service. Danish ferry operator DFDS confirmed the MV Arrow would act as the firm's main freight vessel for the Jersey to Portsmouth route from 28 March. Currently based in Douglas, the MV Arrow can carry 66 14m (46ft) trailers and accommodate 12 passengers. It was bought by the Steam Packet for about £8m in 2022 as a back-up freight vessel for the island's then flagship ferry, the Ben-my-Chree. While it has remained an option for the firm since the arrival of the Manxman in July 2023, under the company's sea services agreement with the Manx government the former flagship ferry must be retained for back-up passenger and freight services. Jersey's government signed a contract with DFDS to operate ferry services in the Channel Islands in December. On March 28 the Danish firm is set to take over the contract from previous provider Condor Ferries, which had also used the MV Arrow to increase freight capacity. It will travel to Teeside for its own dry-docking before its charter with DFDS following the return of the Ben-my-Chree to Manx waters next month. Steam Packet managing director Brian Thomson said the year-long charter would take place while the firm ""future fleet strategy"" was agreed, he said. A committee of Manx politicians recently recommended a new sea services framework should be developed for the Isle of Man by the end of 2025. A spokesman for DFDS said the MV Arrow would be the main freight vessel for the Portsmouth route, alongside its RoPax vessel Stena Vinga, which would provide freight and passenger capacity. The Danish firm said it was making a ""considerable investment"" into its fleet to provide ""modern and comfortable accommodation"" through a refurbishment of the fast ferry Levante Jet, which would service the Jersey to Poole route from April.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdryre7y4n0o,Son loses case against parents over move to Africa,2025-02-27T15:35:00.536Z,Sanchia Berg and Levi Jouavel,"A 14-year-old boy has lost a court case he brought against his own parents after they moved him from London to Ghana to go to boarding school. The boy, described in court as shy, articulate, a keen cook and footballer, said his parents had tricked him into going to Africa, saying it was to visit a sick relative. He said had he known he was being sent to boarding school ""there would have been no way I would have agreed to it"". But the High Court in London also heard his parents were worried he was being ""groomed"" into criminal activity. In a written statement to the court, he said: ""I feel like I am living in hell. I really do not think I deserve this and I want to come home, back to England, as soon as possible."" In his judgment, High Court judge Mr Justice Hayden said he recognised that ""this is, in many ways, both a sobering and rather depressing conclusion."" He said that he was satisfied that the parents' wish for their son to move to Ghana was ""driven by their deep, obvious and unconditional love"". The boy was at risk of suffering greater harm returning to the UK, he said. He said that the boy's parents believe ""and in my judgement with reason"" that their son has ""at very least peripheral involvement with gang culture and has exhibited an unhealthy interest in knives"". The boy's father told the judge the couple did not want their son to be ""yet another black teenager stabbed to death in the streets of London."" The boy, who had lived in the UK since birth, said he was ""mocked"" and ""never settled in"" at the school in Ghana. He said he ""could also barely understand what was going on and I would get into fights"". The boy wrote that he was ""so scared and desperate"" that he emailed the British High Commission in Accra as well as contacting the charity Children and Family Across Borders, who it is believed put him in touch with lawyers at the International Family Law Group. ""I am from London, England, and I want to go back home,"" he wrote. He said he had been ""mistreated"" at the school, adding: ""I'm begging to go back to my old school."" However the High Court heard that the boy's parents had sent him because they feared for his safety in London. In a statement, his mother said sending him to Africa was ""not a punishment but a measure to protect him"". She referred to the murder of Kelyan Bokassa, the 14-year-old boy who was stabbed to death on a bus in Woolwich in January. That was ""every parent's worst nightmare"", she said. She said she did not believe her son would survive in the UK and did not want to be part of her son's ""destruction"". Rebecca Foulkes, representing the boy's father, said the boy met 11 of the points on a checklist produced by the children's charity NSPCC to indicate whether a child might have joined a gang or was being criminally exploited. That included being absent from school, having unexplained money, buying new things, and carrying weapons. She said it was not only the parents who were worried. His school claimed it had ""suspicions about him engaging in criminal activities"" and had observed him in expensive clothes and with mobile phones. The boy said he had never been part of a gang, nor ""involved in gangs in any way"". He said he ""does not know anyone involved in a gang"" and he does not carry a knife. He acknowledged in his statements that ""my behaviour wasn't the best"" and said he thought that was the reason his parents sent him to Africa. The case centred on the question of parental responsibility, and whether the parents acted unlawfully by sending their son to boarding school without his consent. In a statement issued after the judgement, his parents said: ""This has been a really difficult time for us all."" They added: ""Our priority has always been protecting our son and our focus now is on moving forward as a family."" James Netto from the International Family Law Group, who represented the boy, said the court judgment had been a ""real shock"" to the teenager. ""He was obviously incredibly disappointed, incredibly upset and is considering his next steps carefully."" The boy's barrister, Deirdre Fottrell KC, pointed out the school was not simply far from home - but a completely different jurisdiction. The boy wrote that his education was suffering. He felt the Ghanaian classes were not as challenging as those in his English school, and he had been out of formal education entirely since last summer, studying online. He wrote: ""I want to have an education again and grow up like a normal person. I feel like my brain is hurt here. I feel like now I am dumber than people I used to be smarter than."" The boy's father has recently visited him in Africa, and he told the court that he and his son had got on well. He said he would like his son to remain in Ghana, and said they visited a different boarding school where the boy could be considered for a place. The father said they were both very impressed. However, questioned by Ms Fottrell, he acknowledged there was no place in that school until September, and that his son had not said he wanted to go there. The boy's solicitor said he had recently seen a rise in similar cases where teenagers were trying to return to the UK. ""Teenagers are often placed in exceptionally challenging or vulnerable situations, and are now beginning to turn to the court for protection,"" Mr Netto said. He said he had seen cases where ""in their parents' eyes"" young people were ""falling in with the wrong crowd or are adopting what their parents see as unorthodox or challenging behaviours"". Following the judgment, he added: ""We have already received enquiries from young people in exactly the same situation as this young man."" "
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-53699511,How many people cross the Channel in small boats and how many claim asylum?,2025-02-27T15:14:08.000Z,,"The government has announced a series of measures to tackle people smuggling, including a new criminal offence of endangering the lives of others at sea. Almost 37,000 people crossed the English Channel in small boats in 2024. The number of people claiming asylum in the UK during the year to December 2024 was the highest since records began, in 1979. As at 10 February 1,554 people had crossed the Channel since the start of 2025. In 2024 as a whole, 36,816 were detected making the crossing. The highest figures were for 2022, when 45,755 people arrived. Since 2018, when figures were first recorded, more than 150,000 people have arrived in small boats. Of those who arrived in 2024, more than 23,000 did so after Labour won the July 2024 general election. The Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill sets out Labour's plan to treat people smugglers like terrorists. Suspects face travel bans, social-media blackouts and phone restrictions. A new offence of endangering lives at sea will carry a jail term of up to five years. And those convicted of acts in preparation for smuggling - such as buying boat parts - will face up to 14 years in prison. Separately, the government has issued guidance saying anyone entering the UK by an irregular route - such as a small boat crossing - will normally be refused citizenship. Previously, refugees who entered this way could apply for citizenship after 10 years. The Refugee Council estimates at least 71,000 people will be affected. The International Organization for Migration (IOM), a UN agency, tracks the number of people who die attempting to cross the Channel. The IOM estimates that at least 78 migrants died in 2024, making it the deadliest year on record. It says that at least 225 migrants have lost their lives attempting to cross since 2018. Its figures include people who were travelling to a crossing point and died in other circumstances, such as car crashes or as a result of medical issues. The Refugee Council said that government enforcement efforts have increased the dangers of crossings, with more people crammed into less seaworthy boats. According to the latest Home Office figures, Afghans were the top nationality arriving by small boat in 2024, with just under 5,919. Syrians made up the second largest group, followed by people from Iran, Vietnam and Eritrea. These five nationalities accounted for 61% of all small-boat arrivals. Albanians were the top nationality detected arriving by small boat in 2022, with 12,658 arrivals, but only 616 people came from the country in 2024. More than 108,130 people claimed asylum in the UK in the year ending December 2024, the Home Office figures show, the highest number since records began, in 1979, an increase of 18% compared with 2023, and almost twice the number in 2021. The previous peak, of 103,000 was recorded in 2002, as people fled conflicts in Afghanistan, Somalia and Iraq. Claims fell sharply after 2002, dropping to a 20-year low of 22,600 in 2010. But numbers rose again throughout the 2010s, as refugees fled Syria, and have risen again recently, after an increase in recorded small-boat arrivals. And in 2024, almost one out of every three (32%) of those claiming asylum arrived via this route. In the year to December 2024, the largest number of asylum seekers came from Pakistan, with more than 10,500 applications. A quarter of all applications came from people from Pakistan, Afghanistan (8,508) and Iran (8,099), Ukrainian refugees who came to the UK after Russia's invasion of their country are not included in the figures. As at 17 December 2024, 267,200 visas had been issued to Ukrainian refugees, who came through legal routes set up by the UK government. There are also separate arrangements for a few other specific groups, such as some Afghan refugees and Hong Kong citizens. The Home Office figures show 91% of the 7,800 refugees resettled in the UK in 2024 arrived through the Afghan Resettlement Programme. Some people wait months or even years for their claims to be considered. At the end of December 2024, 90,686 cases relating to 124,802 people were awaiting an initial decision. That is 5% fewer than were waiting at the end of 2023 - but the the number of outstanding cases is still higher than before 2022. Former Conservative Prime Minister Rishi Sunak had pledged to clear older claims by the end of 2023. But 4,500 ""complex cases"" were still awaiting a decision at the end of December that year and 1,428 remained unresolved at the end of December 2024. The Home Office can remove people with no legal right to stay in the UK, or refuse to let them enter. In the year to the end of December 2024,8,200 people who were not granted asylum were returned to their home country, an increase of 28% from 2023. Albanians were the most common nationality for enforced returns in 2024 - 84%, compared with 87% of all returns in 2023. Between 2018 and December 2024, 4,995 people who came to the UK in small boats were returned - about 3% of the total small-boat arrivals during the period. There were more than 180,000 arrivals by sea in Europe during 2024, with Italy receiving more than a third. Greece and Spain also received large numbers. In 2023, there were 263,000 arrivals by sea in Europe. In the year ending September 2024, 1.11 million people claimed asylum in the European Union and European Economic Area, down 3% compared with the previous year. Germany received the most applicants, 294,415 - more than a quarter of the total. France was second (162,390) followed by Italy (162,305), Spain (161,470) and the UK (99,790)."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zzxeeveeo,UK asylum claims hit highest level since 1979,2025-02-27T14:53:05.456Z,Cachella Smith and Tom Symonds Rob England,"The number of people claiming asylum in the UK in 2024 has reached its highest level since records began in 1979, Home Office figures show. According to data published on Thursday, 108,138 people claimed asylum in the year to December 2024 - an increase of 18% on 2023 and almost twice the number in 2021. The Home Office said the previous recorded peak was in 2002. The new high follows an uptick in recorded small boat arrivals in recent years. The number of small boat arrivals also increased in 2024 - 25% higher than in 2023 - but the figure was 20% lower than in 2022. The UK now receives the fifth largest number of asylum seekers in the ""EU plus"" area at a time when the government is under pressure to cut the asylum decision backlog. These figures, which cover the end of the Conservative government and the start of Labour, show the number of asylum cases awaiting an initial decision fell by 5% last year - with more than 90,600 cases, relating to around 124,800 people, pending a decision as of the end of 2024. The number remains higher than before 2022. The UK also sent more people into immigration detention last year, with that figure increasing by 12%. Meanwhile, the UK returned 2,251 people to another country who had arrived by small boat last year, a 10% increase compared to 2023. There has also been a sharp increase in people granted citizenship - with the figure standing at more than 269,600 in 2024. The prime minister's deputy official spokesman said there were ""no quick fixes"" to the ""global"" problem of illegal migration, but the government had a ""serious long-term plan to restore order to the asylum system"". Border Security and Asylum minister Angela Eagle criticised the previous government for a ""broken asylum system"", saying Labour inherited a ""huge backlog"" of claims. ""We are beginning to get some order to the system but it will take time to make certain that we can get a grip and start making the system work again."" Asked why claims are so high, Eagle said ""many people want to come here"", further referring to those coming on work and student visas and then claiming asylum. She underlined ""we have to be much tougher"" dealing with visa overstayers. Shadow home secretary Chris Philp described the figures as ""no surprise,"" saying there was ""no deterrent"". Philp added that the blame for the numbers ""lies firmly at Labour's feet, who have been slow to act to tackle the crisis unfolding on our border"". The British Red Cross's policy, research and advocacy director Mubeen Bhutta called for the government to create ""more safe routes"" to prevent people taking dangerous journeys to the UK. ""Behind today's numbers are real men, women and children who have been forced to flee their homes. Too many are making perilous journeys to find safety, because they have no other option,"" Bhutta said in a statement. ""For the vast majority of people, there is no way to claim asylum in the UK without already being here."" New guidance issued for visa and immigration staff earlier this month set out that anyone entering the UK illegally having made a dangerous journey to do so, including those already here, will normally be refused citizenship. The measure was criticised by the Refugee Council as well as some Labour MPs. The Refugee Council said on Thursday it was ""encouraged"" the government continued to work on the ""broken asylum system"" during its first six months in power. However, it called for further efforts to cut the backlog of asylum applications to avoid people ""stuck in hotels, trapped in limbo and unable to work"". The government's use of hotels to house asylum seekers has continued to rise, with more than 38,000 in hotels at the end of December. That figure was still lower than the peak of 56,000 hit in September 2023. The government has pledged to stop this practice by the end of the parliament. The government is legally obliged to provide accommodation to asylum seekers who cannot afford to support themselves while their claims are being considered. But the number of people seeking asylum in the UK has hit record levels, leading to a shortage of spaces in existing accommodation. While irregular arrivals rose last year, the number of work and study visas - which account for a majority of arrivals, not including visitors and transit, examined by the Home Office - dropped. The previous Conservative government introduced measures to reduce legal migration with changes to visa processes – including an increase to the minimum salary for a UK skilled worker visa. The Conservatives also banned health and social care workers and most international students from bringing family to the UK. The number of people coming to the UK on work visas last year fell by about 250,000. This was almost evenly split between fewer people coming for work (down by more than 125,000) and fewer family members coming with them (down by nearly 120,000). Both falls were largely driven by trends in the health and care worker route. The previous government introduced a special visa to bring people into the sector. This led to huge rises in visas issued - especially since people coming to work in care tend to bring more family with them than people coming on other work visas. But Rishi Sunak's government tightened the rules late in 2023, leading to falls in people coming on this visa throughout last year. In September 2024, the current Labour government announced further measures including stronger rules around visa sponsorship of migrant workers. A White Paper is due to be published this year setting out a plan to reduce legal migration. Dr Ben Brindle, researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford, referred to a ""boom and bust"" in some visa categories over recent years. ""The large declines in visa grants have been possible primarily because the number of visas previously being issued in the post-Brexit immigration system was so high,"" he said. ""Despite the declines, overall visa grants to non-EU citizens remain well above pre-Brexit levels."""

The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) announced £100m of funding in December as part of its Plan for Change - an initiative to improve social care across England - with £25m being released nationwide this week. Seven hospice operators across the region will share £1.07m of funding. Minister for Care Stephen Kinnock said it was the ""largest investment in a generation"" and would help ""transform hospice facilities across England"". Paul Brinsley, CEO of Cornwall Hospice Care, said the £161,000 it is set to receive would help it improve sustainability and reduce overheads by installing insulation and improving double glazing, while it was exploring options for how to invest the next batch of money. Mr Brinsley said it was ""exciting"" to get money to invest in one-off capital projects, but added it was a ""struggle"" getting longer-term funding. The remainder of the funding - which will be used to ""modernise facilities, improve IT systems and ensure patients receive the highest quality care"" - would be released in April, DHSC said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5dyyq6v86o,Ten Church of England clergy face disciplinary action,2025-02-25T18:59:41.536Z,Aleem Maqbool Steve Swann,"The Church of England says it is initiating disciplinary proceedings against 10 members of clergy following a review of evidence in the report into the prolific abuser, John Smyth. Among those facing action are former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey and Rev Andrew Cornes - who was due to be on the committee picking the next Archbishop of Canterbury. Smyth, who died in 2018, used horrific violence to attack boys at his Winchester home in the 1970s and 1980s, the Makin Review into his abuse found. Justin Welby, who stepped down as Archbishop of Canterbury earlier this year because of the scandal, is among several senior figures not facing action because of ""insufficient evidence"" for disciplinary proceedings. Also not facing action but coming under criticism in the Makin Review are four serving bishops - the current Bishop of Lincoln Stephen Conway, Bishop of Episcopal Ministry in the Anglican Communion Jo Bailey Wells, Bishop of St Edmundsbury and Ipswich Martin Seeley and the Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba. A survivor of Smyth's abuse told the BBC he was relieved that some were ""at long last"" being held to account for their failings but said he was surprised others had not been named. The long-awaited report was released in November and detailed ""the prolific, brutal and horrific"" abuse perpetrated against more than 120 boys and young men by Smyth at Christian camps from the late 1970s in England until his death in South Africa in 2018. That review led to the resignation of Justin Welby for what he acknowledged was his ""personal and institutional responsibility"". The Church's National Safeguarding Team has since reviewed the evidence against nearly 40 other active clergy criticised in the report, deciding that some of it meets the threshold for further action. Those who are facing disciplinary proceedings by the Church of England are accused in the report of various degrees of failing to act during the timeline of Smyth's abuse. The report said former Archbishop of Canterbury George Carey had been informed of the abuse in an outline of a report in 1983 which ""contained enough information about abuses to signal a need for action regarding John Smyth"". Lord Carey denied seeing it and told the review he did not know Smyth when he studied at Trinity Theological College when Lord Carey was principal. Makin said that ""seems highly unlikely"" given Smyth's public prominence at the time. He gave up his ""permission to officiate"" in December following a BBC investigation into the Church of England's handling of a separate sexual abuse case. Another priest that now faces disciplinary action is Canon Andrew Cornes, a retired clergyman from the Chichester diocese who was due to be a member of the Crown Nominations Commission that will appoint the next Archbishop of Canterbury. The Makin review said Rev Cornes was told in 1982 by a victim of Smyth about abuse he suffered. It said there was ""no evidence to suggest that Andrew Cornes took action to respond to this, he suggests that he thought that the matter was being dealt with"". The Church of England has clarified that Rev Cornes has ""voluntary stepped back from ministry pending the outcome of this process and will not be participating in the Crown Nominations Commission"". The full list of clergy to face disciplinary action includes: Because of the length of time after their alleged failures to act took place, the initiation of the disciplinary process for each needs to be approved by the Church's President of Tribunals. Given the vulnerability of the victims involved, it is understood they are likely to proceed. The so-called clergy disciplinary measure process could lead to anyone found guilty being prohibited from exercising church ministry for life. Mark Stibbe was groomed and brutally beaten by Smyth after joining his school's Christian Forum in 1977 and has waited decades for justice. Mr Stibbe said he was ""relieved"" those identified in the review would be ""held to account for their failings"". ""I, along with my fellow Smyth survivors, wait with keen interest to see whether any disciplinary measures are enforced,"" he said. ""I am surprised that those senior clergy who in 2013 knew the full extent of Smyth's abuses, and who did not properly ensure that Smyth was brought to justice, are not named in the list released today,"" he added. ""Nevertheless, it's good to know that after all these years not only the truth is being discovered but that justice is being done"". Alexander Kubeyinje, the Church of England's national director of safeguarding, said survivors and victims had endured lifelong effects from Smyth's ""appalling abuse"". ""We have announced next steps in the process looking at both risk and disciplinary processes,"" he added. Smyth had also worked as a barrister representing morality campaigner Mary Whitehouse whilst he ran the camps for young evangelical Christians. Reports of his physical abuse of boys were first revealed in an investigation by Channel 4 News, in February 2017. Smyth and his wife Anne were excommunicated by his local church in Cape Town, South Africa, the year before he died.

Ryan Castellucci previously lost a High Court challenge to have their gender recorded as non-binary on a gender recognition certificate - a document which changes someone's legal sex - after moving to the UK in 2019. They had obtained legal recognition as non-binary in California in 2021, and were issued an American passport in 2022 listing their sex as 'X'. Dismissing the appeal, Lord Justice Singh said the issue was ""potentially controversial"" and was ""better suited to resolution in Parliament than the courts"". At an earlier hearing, the court heard how Castellucci, a cyber security expert who moved to the UK from California, uses the title ""Mx"" and refers to themselves using they/them pronouns. While they have undergone surgery and hormone treatment, they told the court they continue to use the name Ryan as it is considered unisex in the US. Castellucci described the experience of trying to obtain legal documents listing them as non-binary as an ""ordeal"" and the court heard they worried about possible difficulties related to their gender identity when applying for British citizenship. They also raised concerns about how their gender identity would be reflected on their death certificate, when their US documents state they are non-binary. Lord Justice Singh, sitting with Dame Victoria Sharp and Sir Andrew McFarlane, said that only 11 countries worldwide, as well as some US states including California, recognise non-binary gender in law. Non-binary is an umbrella term for those those who do not identify as exclusively male or female. In a judgment published on Tuesday, Lord Justice Singh said: ""The concept of 'gender' in the Gender Recognition Act (GRA), when referred to in the context of the domestic law route, is confined to two genders."" He added that, at an earlier appeal in 2023, the government said ""no changes were currently needed and more research and consultation would be needed before any changes were contemplated"". He continued: ""There is no general consensus, either in the Council of Europe or more generally around the world, in favour of recognising non-binary status. ""Furthermore, this is an area of social policy which is highly sensitive and potentially controversial, thereby being better suited to resolution in Parliament rather than in the courts. ""This is not only for reasons of democratic legitimacy but also for reasons of institutional competence."" Anna Dews, associate solicitor at Leigh Day, the firm which represented Castellucci, said they were considering appealing the ruling. She said: ""Ryan's only registered gender is non-binary. Despite Parliament legislating for the UK to recognise foreign-acquired genders, the courts have so far ruled that non-binary foreign genders do not count. ""Ryan considers that there cannot be true gender equality without recognition of the fact that not all genders are binary."""

The UK Department for Transport has committed up to £5m towards the project with that sum matched by the Scottish government. The funding had previously been agreed through the Borderlands Growth Deal but the new UK Labour government wanted to carry out a spending review before releasing its share. It paves the way to appoint a project manager to assess the ""benefits and challenges"" of extending the line beyond Tweedbank and on to Carlisle. The news comes ahead of the 10th anniversary of the opening of the line between Edinburgh and the Borders later this year. Both the Scottish and UK governments agreed in 2021 to provide £10m towards exploring the feasibility of progressing the line from Tweedbank to Carlisle. However, it has taken four years for the funding package to be finally unlocked. UK government Scotland Office Minister Kirsty McNeill said: ""It's great news that the UK Department for Transport has now confirmed up to £5m towards feasibility work to explore the potential to extend the Borders Railway from Tweedbank to Carlisle. ""We look forward to working with deal partners as the feasibility work progresses."" Scotland's Transport Secretary Fiona Hyslop said the Scottish government remained committed to providing £5m towards taking the project forward. ""We welcome the news that the UK government will now match our commitment of up to £5m for a feasibility study to extend the Borders Railway and are supportive of partners securing a project manager with the technical expertise to deliver the project well,"" she said. Rail Minister Lord Hendy added: ""I'm pleased to commit to the progression of the Borders Railway extension, which would open up the route for more people to explore the region's picturesque landscapes and rich heritage, and I look forward to seeing how the proposal develops."" Scottish Borders Council leader Euan Jardine said they were making ""significant strides"" towards the extension of the line. ""We have already seen the positive impact the Waverley line has brought to the Borders,"" he said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-47158287,What is assisted dying and how could the law change?,2025-02-25T12:30:24.000Z,,"MPs voted in support of a proposal to legalise assisted dying in England and Wales, in November 2024. Months of detailed scrutiny and further votes in the Commons and Lords are required before the bill could become law. At present, laws throughout the UK prevent people from asking for medical help to die. The Terminally Ill Adults (End of Life) Bill was introduced by backbench Labour MP Kim Leadbeater. It proposes giving terminally ill people the right to choose to end their life. It says that anyone who wants to end their life must: Once a patient's application has been approved, they would then have to wait 14 days before proceeding. A doctor would prepare the substance being used to end the patient's life, but the person would take it themselves. The bill defines the coordinating doctor as a registered medical practitioner with ""training, qualifications and experience"" at a level to be specified by the Health Secretary. It does not say which drug would be used. It would be illegal to use dishonesty, pressure, or to coerce someone into declaring they want to end their life, with a possible 14-year prison sentence. Under the original proposals, a High Court judge would have to approve each request to end a life. However, Leadbetter has suggested a panel of legal and medical experts should oversee applications instead. The panel would be chosen by a new Voluntary Assisted Dying Commission which would be led by a High Court judge or senior former judge. The proposal follows concerns that the High Court would not have capacity to rule on each individual case. However, some opponents have said the move undermines the bill's safeguards. The change would need to be approved by the MPs scrutinising the bill. Many months of activity lie ahead in the Commons and the Lords. There are 23 MPs on the committee reviewing the legislation line-by-line. They include 14 supporters - including two ministers - and nine opponents. The committee is holding public hearings and taking evidence from experts. It will then propose amendments to the bill. It is hoped that the committee process will be finished in time for the bill to return to the House of Commons on 25 April. At that stage, all MPs will have a chance to debate and vote on the changes proposed by the committee. There would then be more scrutiny in the Commons and the Lords, and further voting. Even if the bill clears all its parliamentary hurdles, MPs have been told there would be a period of up to two years before any new law would be implemented. It is possible the bill could fall and not become law at all. The historic vote saw 330 MPs support the assisted dying bill, and 275 reject it. MPs were given a free vote on the issue, which meant they could make their own decision rather than follow party instructions. The government is impartial on the issue. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was among those to vote in favour of the bill, as was Chancellor Rachel Reeves. However, Deputy Prime Minister Angela Rayner, Foreign Secretary David Lammy, Health Secretary Wes Streeting and Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood all voted against. Most Conservative MPs rejected the bill, including party leader Kemi Badenoch. The former PM Rishi Sunak and former deputy PM Oliver Dowden were among the minority of Tory MPs who supported it. When MPs last voted on the issue in 2015, they rejected different proposals by 330 votes to 118. A separate bill is under discussion in Scotland. Liberal Democrat MSP Liam McArthur drafted the Assisted Dying for Terminally Ill Adults (Scotland) Bill. If passed by MSPs, eligible applicants would have to: The bill is being considered by the health committee ahead of an initial vote by MSPs. The first stage of the committee's work is due to be completed by 23 May 2025. In October 2024, Scottish Health Secretary Neil Gray said the proposed legislation went beyond the limits of Holyrood's powers, and was a matter for Westminster. However, McArthur said he was confident the UK and Scottish governments could find a solution if MSPs backed his bill. Parts of the British Isles but able to set their own laws, the Isle of Man and Jersey are both considering proposals to allow assisted dying. The Isle of Man's Assisted Dying Bill is reaching its final stages in the Manx parliament. Adults expected to die within 12 months would be eligible. And politicians are debating whether to reduce the residency criteria from five years (as specified in the bill) to 12 months. Once the outstanding issues are resolved, the bill is likely to receive royal assent and become law, with the scheme potentially in place by 2027. Jersey's politicians backed the principle of legalising assisted dying in 2021. And in May 2024, they approved plans to allow assisted dying for those with a terminal illness ""causing unbearable suffering"". Final legislation is currently being written, and once approved, an 18-month implementation period would begin, meaning new rules would take effect in summer 2027 at the earliest. Opponents warn that people could be put under pressure to end their lives and want improvements to palliative care instead. Paralympian and House of Lords crossbencher Baroness Grey-Thompson is a vocal critic. She told the BBC she is worried about ""the impact on vulnerable people, on disabled people, [the risk of] coercive control, and the ability of doctors to make a six-month diagnosis"". Actor and disability-rights activist Liz Carr, who made BBC One documentary Better Off Dead?, also opposes changing the law. ""Some of us have very real fears based on our lived experience and based on what has happened in other countries where it's legal,"" she wrote on X. Dr Gordon Macdonald, from campaign group Care Not Killing, said: ""The safest law is the one we currently have. ""This bill is being rushed with indecent haste and ignores the deep-seated problems in the UK's broken and patchy palliative care system."" Leadbeater argues the law needs changing because some people ""have a horrible, harrowing death"", however good their end-of-life or palliative care is. Cancer patient Nathaniel Dye worked on the bill with Leadbeater. He said it would allow people a death which was ""as kind and compassionate as possible"". The Dignity in Dying campaign group said the bill provides the ""most detailed, robust proposals"" on the issue that ""Westminster has ever considered"". According to chief executive Sarah Wootton, the fact that every year ""up to 650 terminally ill people end their own lives, often in lonely and traumatic ways,"" shows that the status quo is not working. One of the highest-profile advocates for change is broadcaster Dame Esther Rantzen, who has stage-four lung cancer. ""All I'm asking for is that we be given the dignity of choice,"" Dame Esther told BBC News. ""If I decide that my own life is not worth living, please may I ask for help to die?"" Both the British Medical Association, which represents doctors, and the Royal College of Nursing are neutral on the issue. There is some debate over exactly what the various terms mean. However, assisted dying generally refers to a person who is terminally ill receiving lethal drugs from a medical practitioner, which they administer themselves. Assisted suicide is intentionally helping another person to end their life, including someone who is not terminally ill. That could involve providing lethal medication or helping them travel to another jurisdiction to die. Euthanasia is the act of deliberately ending a person's life to relieve suffering in which a lethal drug is administered by a physician. Patients may not be terminally ill. There are two types: voluntary euthanasia, where a patient consents; and non-voluntary, where they cannot because, for example, they are in a coma. The Dignity in Dying campaign group says more than 200 million people around the world have legal access to assisted dying. Switzerland has allowed assisted suicide since 1942. Its Dignitas facility - which accepts foreign patients as well as Swiss nationals. Between 1998 and 2023 it helped 571 Britons to die. Assisted suicide is also legal in Austria. In the US, 11 states - Oregon, California, New Mexico, Colorado, Washington, Hawaii, New Jersey, Vermont, Maine and Washington DC - allow ""physician-assisted dying"". It permits doctors to prescribe lethal drugs for self-administration. Voluntary euthanasia is legal in Canada where it is called medical assistance in dying. It can be provided by a doctor or nurse practitioner, either in person or through the prescription of drugs for self-administration. Medically-assisted dying accounted for 4.7% of deaths in Canada in 2023. It is also legal in Spain and Colombia, both of which also permit assisted suicide. Assisted dying is legal in some parts of Australia but the law differs across states. New Zealand's End of Life Choice Act legalises assisted dying and allows adults in their final months of life to request assistance from a medical professional. Three countries have laws that allow people who are not terminally ill to receive assistance to die: The Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.

The charity told the BBC ""an organisation-wide consultation"" has begun and said that ""hard-won rights are being rolled back for marginalised communities across the world"". Only roles with dedicated funding would be safe, Stonewall's CEO Simon Blake told staff in a call on Thursday. When asked by the BBC how much foreign aid spending cuts related to their decision, Stonewall said there are ""a number of reasons for the consultation"". Stonewall has 114 employees, according to the UK charity commission website. The charity's largest funder in recent years has been the Global Equality Fund (GEF), which is overseen by the US state department. It has given Stonewall more than £500,000 between 2021 and 2025. Stonewall's accounts show the GEF granted it £137,254 in 2021-22, £204,442 in 2022-23 and £233,583 in 2023-24. The GEF is a pooled fund from several countries and private business, with a focus on ""advancing LGBTI rights around the world"". But, according to the Times, it has not published accounts since 2015. President Trump is a long-term critic of overseas spending and has said it needs to be brought in line with his ""America First"" strategy. The US government has announced a freeze on funding for aid projects while it undertakes a ""review"" to ensure they align with Trump's priorities. Mr Blake warned about the impact that Trump's policies would have on Stonewall and LGBTQ+ rights globally. ""The work to advocate for LGBTQ+ equality has never been more important and Stonewall is rising to meet the challenge,"" Stonewall said in a statement to the BBC. ""We are seeing an unprecedented political backlash against the principles of inclusion. Stonewall is adapting to ensure that it is fit for purpose and able to meet the challenges of this new political era."" The statement added that ""many charities in the UK are facing tough choices for a range of reasons, including the economic environment. Stonewall is no different"". The charity also said that its work in eastern Europe is ""a good example of the type of project that may cease if funding isn't replaced"". Stonewall's projects in eastern Europe help communities and law enforcement agencies to respond to anti-LGBTQ+ violence and provide ""vital services to victims"", according to Mr Blake.

Simon Tite, 42, from Coventry, planned to propose to partner Emma Francis, 39, at Plemont Bay on Saturday for their sixth anniversary. But Mr Tite said strong winds led to the cancellation of a ferry from Poole in Dorset and repair work meant they were unable to access his desired beach for the proposal. However, after success when he popped the question on board a boat, he said: ""It couldn't have been any better. Despite the fact it was challenging to get there, it was 100,000% worth it."" Mr Tite said Plemont was Miss Francis's ""favourite place in the world"". He said the pair drove to Poole on Thursday with the intention of catching the Condor Ferry on Friday. He said: ""We got to Poole and all the ferries were cancelled because of the weather. ""I was like: 'I do not believe this'. ""I desperately booked flights for us to come on the Friday from Southampton."" Mr Tite said the proposal plans were met with another obstacle after he discovered access to the preferred beach was blocked off due to repair work. He said he contacted the government's infrastructure department to see if it would allow them to access the beach to walk on it. Officials said no due to safety reasons. Mr Tite said he then arranged a boat ride for the proposal, adding he planned for the pair to swim into the bay He said he hired wetsuits but the rigid inflatable boat (RIB) company said there ""was no way"" the pair could get into the water due to the strong winds. Mr Tite said: ""The wind and the waves were just amazingly massive."" He then popped the question on board the RIB at sea. Miss Francis said: ""I had a face like thunder because I'd been told, in February: 'You're gonna put a wetsuit on. ""Every turn it was: 'Oh, we're not doing this now.' ""I didn't know what was happening at all."" However, despite that the ""bizarre"" experience and eventually realising what was happening, Mrs Tite-to-be said the location was ""perfect"".

Milk production firm Arla said it planned to close its Settle site by the end of 2026, putting 128 roles there under threat. The company, which is headquartered in Leeds, plans to move more of its operations to its Lockerbie site in Scotland, including some that are currently based in Stourton, Leeds. Deanne Ferguson from the GMB union said the closure would be ""a devastating blow for the dedicated workers at Settle and for the local community which relies on this key employer"". Arla Foods' vice president of production, Fran Ball, said the company would be entering into a period of consultation with its employees over the plans. Ms Ball said the proposals ""form part of our strategy to strengthen our manufacturing network and futureproof dairy production in the UK"". An Arla spokesperson said it ""remains committed to being a major employer in the Yorkshire region"". The spokesperson said more than 1,000 people were employed in Leeds, including about 500 people at the company's headquarters in Leeds Valley Park and a further 450 people at its dairy in Stourton. No jobs were under threat in Leeds, they added, although about 24 roles would be impacted due to the changes. Last year the company invested £65m investment in its Stourton site, according to the spokesperson. The company said it planned to invest almost £90m into its Lockerbie site, creating 90 new jobs. The plans include creating a UHT milk ""centre of excellence"". UHT and lacto-free milk is currently produced in Settle. Ms Ferguson said the closure would have ""a significant economic and social impact"". ""We will now begin urgent discussions with Arla to explore all possible options to protect jobs. ""We call on Arla and all stakeholders to engage in full and transparent discussions about the future of the workforce and to consider all available alternatives to compulsory redundancies.""

Natalia Polischuk, from Kyiv, has shared her thanks on the day that marked three years since the beginning of the war in Ukraine. Islanders have stepped up to help in many ways, including knitting and sending thousands of baby hats, taking on daring challenges to raise funds, and even driving to and from the borders to deliver vital aid. Marc Laine, who delivered small generators to Ukraine, said he felt compelled to help residents of the country. He said: ""The first time we went [to Ukraine], we took generators and we were welcomed everywhere - there was a lot of comradery. ""I was inspired by everyone we met - if they weren't involved directly in the conflict, they were doing something to help in their own time, there was so much enthusiasm. ""People in Guernsey have been great, Humanitarian Aid Guernsey are fantastic - they have shipped massive donations from the public to Ukraine."" Ms Polischuk said: ""I think the support is important and we are very grateful for the people of Guernsey. ""I do believe that the generators saved numerous lives in the winters - a lot of places was out of electricity for hours. ""Those generators helped to sustain schools, kindergartens, hospitals - I know that Marc and his team brought smaller generators which helped military hospitals. ""The support is greatly appreciated - the fact that many people from around the world helped... that was huge."" Follow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgp4l170kpo,"Southport attack yoga teacher: 'If I didn't get out, everyone was going to die'",2025-02-24T05:59:05.478Z,Judith Moritz & Jonathan Coffey,"A yoga teacher who almost died in the Southport attack has described for the first time the desperate moments when she helped several children run to safety, despite having been stabbed five times. Leanne Lucas told BBC Panorama how she called 999 as the attacker chased after them. ""I just knew that if I didn't get out, everyone was going to die,"" she said. A 13-year-old helping to run the class, whom we are calling Sarah, also told the BBC that attacker Axel Rudakubana looked ""possessed"" as he stabbed her. Leanne and Sarah are the first survivors who escaped the room to speak publicly. Ten people were injured and three children were killed in the attack last July. Sarah - who is now 14 and whose identity is protected by a court order - was seriously wounded but managed to lead several other children, including her younger sister, to safety. Sitting alongside her parents, she told us how another ""incredible"" girl, who appeared to be only about 10 years old, was keeping other children calm, telling them: ""Don't worry, your parents are going to be here, everything's going to be OK."" The two survivors of the attack, at a Taylor Swift-themed dance and yoga workshop, recounted how they had helped others escape the terrifying violence and how neighbours had rushed to their aid. They also revealed how misinformation spread following the attack, including messages on social media blaming Leanne for the deaths. Leanne and Sarah both expressed shock at how authorities had missed warning signs about the attacker. ""It's so shocking how much evidence they had on him, how he slipped through the net,"" said Leanne. ""You see the best and the worst at the same time,"" said Sarah, who described seeing ""the evil side of people"" in Rudakubana's violence and ""all the good of all the community coming together as well to help everyone"". With the mammoth Eras tour reaching the UK, the summer of 2024 was Taylor Swift's summer. So when children's yoga instructor Leanne Lucas and her friend, dance teacher Heidi Liddle, organised a workshop themed around the singer, it sold out within a week. Twenty-five little girls, the youngest five years old, signed up for a morning of dancing, yoga, and making friendship bracelets at the Hart Space studio on 29 July. Sarah offered to help the two teachers and took photos at the event. As the session was drawing to a close, Leanne gathered all of the children together. ""We went round the circle and they said how they were feeling and one of the little girls said: 'This is the best day of my life',"" Leanne said. The girl, nine-year-old Alice Aguiar, died later that night. Seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and six-year-old Bebe King were also killed in the attack. Rudakubana, the killer, had arrived by taxi, wearing a bright green hoodie and a medical face mask that covered his mouth. Dashcam footage shows him trying a locked door at the Hart Space before walking through an open doorway and heading up the stairs. Leanne saw the attacker briefly through the window, but she had no idea who he was – or that he posed a threat. The next thing she knew, he was in the room. ""He opened the door and grabbed a child. I don't know what he was doing. I didn't see anything. He then grabbed the next child, and the next child. And then I shout: 'Who is that?'"" Sarah was one of the first to be attacked. ""I saw him stab a child in front of me. And then I saw the knife coming towards me and him coming towards me,"" she said. ""And that's when I saw it go into my arm. And that's when I turned and he must have got my back, but I didn't feel it at the time, because of the adrenaline."" The attacker made his way through the room, before reaching their teacher. ""He moves through the girls by the table and moves next to me,"" Leanne told us, reliving the scene in her mind. ""I just felt something go in my back and my brain just said – he got me."" Leanne suffered five stab wounds – to her spine, her head, her ribs, her lung, and her shoulder blade. Despite this, she managed to get herself and several of the girls out of the room and call the police. ""I just knew that if I didn't get out everyone was going to die,"" she told us, wiping tears from her eyes. ""He was bigger than me. And I just thought: I need to get some help. So we all run towards the door. We were shouting: 'Run!' I called 999 on the landing and I asked for the police."" She said she then saw a flash of green - the attacker's hoodie - ""and I go into panic mode and he's chasing us"". It's clear that more children would have died if the teachers and Sarah hadn't taken the action they did. At Rudakubana's sentencing, the judge said Leanne ""tried to save as many children as she could"" while being attacked, and that ""she did all she could before escaping"". Leanne says: ""The police said we'd all be dead if me and Heidi [fellow organiser] hadn't done what we'd done and that gives nothing for the children who did die... that doesn't take that away."" But like many of those who saved lives that day, she still torments herself. Sarah was left with life-threatening injuries and fractures to two of her spinal vertebrae. ""I remember seeing the girls all like huddling around the stairs,"" she told us calmly. ""So I remember shouting for them to get down and get out. So I was physically pushing them down the stairs to get everyone out. ""I thought that he wasn't going to stop until he killed everyone. I thought that he wanted to kill us all."" Despite her injuries, Sarah managed to lead several other children out of the Hart Space, up the driveway and across the street, where local resident Steve was fixing his garden wall. Sarah told him she had been stabbed and thought she was dying, but Steve reassured her and led the children into his house. ""Everyone was in a blind panic,"" Sarah told us. Steve describes Sarah as ""a hero"". ""She led all them kids away."" He and his wife began taking care of the children. One of the girls who had been stabbed was ""tiny"", Steve recalled, and he could see others were injured too. Meanwhile, James Dixon had heard the screams while working at the garage next door to the Hart Space. ""As a parent, you can tell the difference between a scream of play and a scream of terror,"" he said. ""And this was – nightmares, pain. They were terrified."" A parent was in her car, calling the police, with five or six children in the back. One appeared to be seriously injured. James ran over to another child who had collapsed. ""She asked me: 'Am I going to die?' Which just breaks your heart, but I told her no,"" he said. She was so badly injured he was afraid his reassurance might not be true. ""I focused everything on her to make sure to keep her alive."" James saved the seven-year-old girl's life. Two more workers from the garage, Colin Parry and Julian Medlock, had rushed over to help. They saw Leanne, leaning against a car, ""completely in shock"", said Colin. He asked her if she needed help, but she told him: ""Just look after the girls. Just look after the girls."" ""My brain is going 100 miles an hour but my body won't do anything,"" Leanne recalled. ""And there are people asking me questions and I am saying: 'Go and get the children.' ""I just don't know what else I could have done,"" she said. At the same time, window cleaner Joel Verite had spotted Leanne as he was driving past on his round. He screeched to a halt and saw her point up to the studio, saying that a man was stabbing children up there. Businessman Jon Hayes, who had been working in an adjoining office, had also been stabbed after confronting the attacker. Joel raced inside, shouting as he climbed the stairs. He saw Rudakubana standing at the top of the staircase. ""We locked eyes for a brief second. He's got a knife,"" Joel said. ""My life flashed before my eyes. Who else is with him? Who is going to come behind me?"" Steve had run over from his house, armed with hammers. He met Joel, who had stepped back from the staircase after facing off with the knifeman. ""We had a little chat to ourselves and said, right, are we going to go in and do him or what?"" Steve said. But at that moment, the police arrived. They entered the studio with a Taser, subdued Rudakubana and arrested him. Steve said he saw the police knocking on the locked door of one of the toilets. Inside was Heidi Liddle, Leanne's friend. After helping some of the children escape, she had found an eight-year-old girl hiding in a toilet and had saved her by locking them both inside. It was now noon - the time when the workshop had been due to end - and the street had filled with distraught parents looking for their children. Sarah's dad arrived and saw Joel carrying a child. ""My initial thought was, God - and I just ran for the building,"" he told us. But Steve was telling parents that many of the children were sheltering at his house. There, the door was open and his youngest daughter came out. ""I just gripped tight, ever so hard. She goes, 'I'm fine. I'm fine'."" Still outside the Hart Space studio, Sarah's mum saw ""blood everywhere"". ""There were bloody hands on cars,"" she said. ""When I looked up, I just saw my husband at the end of the street. He was waving me over and I just ran towards him. I just tried not to look at anything or anyone."" Leanne and eight children - including Sarah - were treated for life-threatening injuries. ""I asked someone if I was going to die,"" Leanne said. ""And she didn't say no. She's just said 'you're in the best place'."" Leanne said she heard someone discuss possible paralysis and something about her lungs. Sarah was taken to the same hospital, where her father was told they had had to operate on her lung, which had collapsed from a puncture wound. While Leanne recovered from life-saving surgery, rioting began, first in Southport, then spreading across the UK, following false rumours that the attacker was a Muslim asylum seeker. She said she was targeted on social media by people who blamed her for the children's deaths. ""I just was scared of everybody. And still thinking it was all my fault. If I hadn't arranged the day, if I had never advertised in certain places, if I hadn't used that studio,"" she said. She saw videos of riots taking place on her own street. ""I was like, are they trying to get me?"" Sarah told us ""disinformation"" on social media was one of the reasons she wanted to tell her story - ""to get my voice and the truth out there to everyone"". Others who acted bravely on that day share Leanne's sense of disbelief and turmoil. ""Those screams haunt me,"" says James, who saved a seven-year-old girl's life. ""I'd think to myself, if I ran a little bit quicker, a little bit braver, took a weapon..."" We first met Leanne in January. She had endured six months of waiting for her attacker to be tried. But on the day his trial was due to begin, Axel Rudakubana pleaded guilty to three charges of murder and 10 of attempted murder. For Leanne, this was another act of malice. ""I found out he pleaded guilty on the news,"" Leanne recalled. ""I felt so angry. We knew he did it. He knew he did it. Every single person knew he did it. And he waited until the day of trial to say guilty and put every single family, victim, witness - everyone in that position."" For many witnesses in the case, Rudakubana's last-minute guilty plea – however manipulative in its timing – was a relief. Many were dreading the prospect of sitting in a courtroom with their attacker while lawyers pored over the details of the injuries he had inflicted. Sarah, however, wanted her day in court, saying she'd had all the ""stress and anxiety"" without the ""closure"". Rudakubana was sentenced to 52 years in prison, the maximum sentence allowed because he was 17 years old when he carried out the attack. Leanne said she wanted to speak out now because, even after the court proceedings, she still did not feel the ""absolute trauma"" of that day had been understood. ""I just feel like I am able to be the voice of people you can't hear who are involved in the story,"" she said. On the day her attacker was sentenced, Leanne spoke about the survivor's guilt she lives with. ""I cannot give myself compassion or accept praise, as how can I live knowing I survived when children died,"" she told the court. She said she was struggling to trust others and trying to see the goodness in the world. ""For Alice, Elsie, Bebe, Heidi and the surviving girls, I'm surviving for you,"" she said. She told us about treasured moments with each of the girls who died. She described Bebe's ""pure excitement"" at holding a puppy during a puppy yoga session. The day of the attack was the first time Leanne had met Alice, and the ""beautiful smile"" of this ""confident ballerina"" left an impression. And she recalled Elsie's enthusiasm for the weekly reading and writing lessons they had together. It is clear that their memory is what keeps her going. ""These children represent goodness, I think. Just pure goodness,"" she told us. ""Happiness. How genuine they were. Positive. The love of life and just making the best out of every single moment. That's how I remember them."""

In an interview with 60 Minutes Australia, Jason Knauf, formerly the chief executive of William and Kate's Royal Foundation, said: ""It was awful, absolutely awful. It's the lowest I've ever seen him. ""Within a couple of weeks, if you're Prince William, you find out that both your wife and your father have cancer. I couldn't believe it."" Both the King and the Princess of Wales were treated for cancer last year. Kate is now in remission and Charles is having ongoing treatment. Mr Knauf, 43, stepped down from his position at the end of 2021. Catherine's diagnosis was made public in March last year, and Mr Knauf said: ""The problem was that all this crazy conspiracy theory stuff kicked off in the background, online. 'Was she really ill?'. ""But they didn't want to say yet that she had cancer because they hadn't told the children and they were still working through how to tell the children."" Speaking to reporters last year at the end of his visit to South Africa, Prince William, 42, talked about how he has coped after both his wife and his father were diagnosed with cancer, describing the past year as the ""hardest year"" of his life. ""It's been dreadful. It's probably been the hardest year in my life. So, trying to get through everything else and keep everything on track has been really difficult,"" he said after being asked how his year has been after a difficult year for the Royal Family."" Mr Knauf also previously worked for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. In October 2018, while working for the couple as their communications secretary, Mr Knauf made a bullying complaint against Meghan. He wrote of his concerns to William's then private secretary in an email, in an apparent attempt to force Buckingham Palace to protect staff. The duchess's legal team strenuously denied the allegation. Discussing William's relationship with Harry, Mr Knauf said: ""It's very difficult to have this stuff play out in the public eye, but he's chosen to keep his thoughts on it private, and I think all of us who know him really have to respect that we should do the same. ""But I will say, of course, it's been hard and sad, especially for all of us who know both of them. ""I worked really closely with the two of them and we had lots of great times."" Mr Knauf has previously expressed regret in not giving evidence in the Duchess of Sussex's High Court case against the publisher of the Mail on Sunday, the Court of Appeal. Meghan won her privacy case against Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) in 2021, when the High Court found its publication of her letter to her father - sent in August 2018 - was unlawful. Mr Knauf was made a Lieutenant of the Royal Victorian Order (RVO) in the 2023 New Year Honours List. Before joining the royal household the American-born former corporate affairs executive worked for a range of institutions, from the office of the New Zealand prime minister to HM Treasury and the Royal Bank of Scotland. Mr Knauf led a review of the Royal Foundation's role and structure from March 2019, before becoming its chief executive in September of that year. He oversaw the launch of the Foundation's Earthshot Prize - William's £50 million environmental prize, now an independent charity, which recognises solutions, ideas and technologies that ""repair the planet""."

The Jersey-based detective series originally ran on BBC One from 1981 to 1991 and starred John Nettles. Toby Whithouse, born in Southend-on-Sea, Essex, said he had tried to make the show more ""labyrinth"" and wanted to ""test and challenge"" the character of Jim. Set to premiere on 27 February, the new series stars Damien Molony, alongside Zoë Wanamaker and Philip Glenister. The show followed a maverick detective and recovering alcoholic adept at solving complex crimes. Nettles became a household name due to its success and said he was offered a cameo role but turned it down. Mr Whithouse, whose previous work includes Doctor Who, wanted ""to stay true"" to the programme's roots while offering something new. He said: ""I absolutely wanted to do something that was more complex and more labyrinth and also allowed us to then to develop Jim as a character and to test and challenge him. ""So fans of the original will go away feeling like the show has been respected, and new people, who have come with no baggage or expectations, still really enjoy it."" He told BBC Essex the writing process was far from easy as it was unlike anything he had written before. ""I don't really tend to do police procedure shows, I do more high-concept genres. ""I started to have an idea for the main character and how I would write him and reinvent him. ""In the original show, Jim Bergerac was a recovering alcoholic, which is something that I really wanted to use but we've taken it in a slightly different, more realistic direction."" One of the key changes in the modern version is there will be one story per series instead of one story per week. Bergerac is available on U and U&DRAMA from 27 February.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2nmzrxnlro,Three arrested over man's 2002 disappearance,2025-02-22T13:56:42.165Z,,"Three people have been arrested in connection with the disappearance of a man who went missing more than 20 years ago. Robert Scott Clive, known as Scott, was last seen on 10 October 2002 following a night out in North Shields, North Tyneside, where he had moved to from Stranraer in Scotland a few months earlier. A murder investigation was launched despite no body being found. Northumbria Police said it had now arrested two men, in their 40s and 50s, as well as a woman in her 40s on suspicion of murder. Mr Clive, who lived in Prudhoe Terrace and worked as a labourer, was 30 at the time of his disappearance. Officers say they have reviewed hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and spoken to several people in their efforts to piece together his movements. Police are still searching an address in the Coronation Street area which is a location Mr Clive is known to have visited on the evening he went missing. Last June, a 49-year-old man was arrested in connection with the investigation. He has since been released on bail pending further inquiries. Unconfirmed sightings in the early hours of 11 October 2002 placed a man matching Mr Clive's description near the banks of the River Tyne. His mother, Tricia Clive, speaking last year, said the family were ""still in limbo"" as they did not believe he fell into the river. Det Insp Mark Atherton, who is leading the case, said: ""We are doing everything we can to provide Scott's family with the answers they deserve. ""We still believe there could be key information that people know in the local community.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr42xvrvrl9o,More struggling councils to sell assets and borrow cash,2025-02-21T17:53:09.490Z,Paul Seddon,"The government has agreed to relax budgeting rules for a record 29 English councils to allow them to balance their books next year. The authorities will be allowed to use Treasury loans or cash from selling assets to cover day-to-day spending, which they are normally banned from doing. The figure is up from 19 that requested such flexibility this year, further underscoring the continued financial fragility of the sector. Ministers will, however, encourage councils not to sell off ""community and heritage assets"" to help meet current spending pressures. It remains to be seen what this means in practice, with the government leaving it to authorities to decide which assets meet this definition. Councils in England will have £69.4bn to spend next year, assuming they increase council tax by the maximum allowed, a 4.3% real-terms rise from this year. But local leaders argue this will not cover the increasing cost of mandatory services such as adult social care and special educational needs, which have eaten up a growing share of their budgets in recent years. On Thursday, the government confirmed 29 councils have requested additional wriggle room to balance their budgets next year, worth a collective £1.5bn, under financial support rules introduced during the Covid pandemic. Details of how exactly each council plans to balance its books will be published at a later date in a series of so-called capitalisation directions. They include six councils - Birmingham, Croydon, Woking, Nottingham, Thurrock and Slough - that have effectively declared bankruptcy in recent years and requested similar help last year. Those asking for the flexibility for the first time include Enfield, Worcestershire, West Berkshire, Trafford, Barnet, Solihull, and Halton. Nineteen were given such flexibility this year, up from eight in 2023, which in turn was more than the five receiving it in 2022. The 29 councils will be able to use money raised through selling assets, such as land and buildings, to cover their day-to-day spending costs. Normally town halls can only use cash from such asset sales on projects designed to reduce their operating costs, such as merging back-office functions or moving services online. They will also be allowed to cover current spending using Treasury-backed loans normally reserved for long-term investment. The government has also confirmed it is removing a 1% surcharge on using Treasury loans in this way, with local government minister Jim McMahon saying the government believed in ""partnership - not punishment"". The premium, which some council leaders have compared to the fees on pay-day loans, was previously seen as a way to encourage councils into selling assets rather than going for government lending. London Councils, an umbrella group for authorities in the capital, said the extra budget flexibility was a ""short-term measure"" that ""leaves us with more long-term debts to worry about"". The government argues changes such as allowing councils to set multi-year budgets, a Labour manifesto pledge, will allow them to put themselves on a more secure financial footing. Ministers are also consulting on introducing a stronger link between overall funding and deprivation from 2026, as part of a wider shake-up of council financing. They argue this will make the system fairer because councils in poorer areas are less able to raise income locally. They have promised the new formula will take into account the ""impact of rurality"" - but they could have a political row on their hands, with Conservative-run councils in more rural areas likely to argue they are being unfairly funded."

The wooden seat made in tribute to Warrington man Bill Batcock was pulled into the Irish Sea off Anglesey in December, before travelling 80 miles (130km) and resurfacing on the Cumbrian coast. It was stumbled upon by members of a local Facebook group who tracked down the man's daughter, Helen Wharton, to tell her the bench had been found. ""Dad was such an adventurer, to think he's made a break for it to go on another adventure, it just makes me smile really,"" she said. Ms Wharton said she and her family had ""no idea"" the bench had gone missing during Storm Darragh in December. She said she was shocked to receive a message on social media with an image of the bench wedged between sand dunes on Drigg beach near Seascale, Cumbria, asking: ""Is this yours?"" ""I couldn't believe it, it was all so strange,"" said Ms Wharton, who lives in Padgate, Warrington. The bench was erected on some exposed headland at Bull Bay on Anglesey to commemorate Mr Batcock, a lover of the Welsh coast and mountains, who died of leukaemia in 2018. He asked for the bench to be placed there ""as he wanted to look out across the sea, across the coast and mountains, towards home"", she said. Words from one of his poems had been inscribed on a plaque on the bench, which read: ""For me, it has to be the sea."" Ms Wharton told BBC Radio Manchester the message was now ""quite ironic"" given the remarkable journey of the bench. She said the campaign to return the bench was ""really lovely"", adding the words on the plaque had intrigued local people. Megan O'Gorman, who runs the local Facebook group in which a member messaged to say they had found the bench, said she was determined to track down the family. ""I thought right, who is this person, where has this bench travelled from,"" she said. Ms Wharton said: ""It's just typical if you think of my dad, nothing would tie him down."" She and her family plan to travel to Cumbria on Friday to collect the bench and return it to its home on Anglesey.

A 63-year-old man was arrested in the Stobswell area of Dundee shortly after 07:15 following a raid by specialist officers. Four hours later, a 23-year-old woman was arrested after officers raided a flat in the Hilltown. A 26-year-old man has also been arrested by police in the West Midlands following simultaneous raids in Birmingham and Wolverhampton. Police officers remain at both properties following the arrests, which were made as the result of intelligence gathered as part of the inquiry. County lines is where drugs, including heroin and cocaine, are moved across the country - the 'county line' itself is a mobile phone number where orders are placed for the drugs. Vulnerable adults and children are often used to sell the drugs, with some people moved from their local area to another part of the country to sell drugs, often to pay off a debt. The Dundee raids were carried out as part of Operation Spignel, a joint operation with police in the West Midlands. Dundee-based Det Insp Alan Swanston from Police Scotland said: ""We've identified a serious organised crime group that are operating out of the West Midlands area and drug dealing in Dundee. ""Specialist officers will also develop and assess the intelligence and build a picture of what the group looks like and where they're located."" Specialist resources are also being made available for the operation, including cybercrime officers. Det Insp Swanston said: ""The arrests will allow us to conduct interviews, examine any phones or devices that have been obtained and also be able to go through the addresses with a fine toothcomb to identify if there is evidence that would back up the intelligence."""

The Vyrnwy Frankton Project, a scheme to build a new substation near Cefn Coch in Powys and connect it to the national network at Lower Frankton in Shropshire, includes underground cables and an overhead line. Six consultation events have been set up in village halls and community centres from 27 February to 8 March by Green Gen Cymru. People will be able to view a digital 3D model of the route, the company said. This is expected to be the final route-wide consultation before a planning application is submitted. North Shropshire MP Helen Morgan has called on the company to consider building the route underground and said communities would be affected visually and by noise. Senior project manager Sean Taylor said the company had considered areas important for tourism and recreation, adding: ""The route is planned to keep effects on these as low as we can, while balancing the effects on the landscape and the environment."" Addressing effects on communities, he said: ""We have carefully considered views to and from villages in designing the connection. As much as possible, we've used woodland and the natural shape of the landscape to help reduce potential visual effects."" Mr Taylor said the project was ""still open to influence"" and the firm was committed to working closely with communities and stakeholders. In Shropshire, consultation events are being held at West Felton Village Hall on 27 February, Hordley & Bagley Village Hall on 28 February and Llanymynech Village Hall on 1 March.

It follows a decision by Jersey and Guernsey's governments to choose different ferry firms to operate their main sea links for the next 15 years, with French firm Manche Iles also offering a passenger ferry. Jersey's government opted for Danish firm DFDS, while Guernsey chose to stay with Condor - both have indicated they plan to operate limited services between the islands, but timetables have not yet been published. Islands Unlimited managing director Chad Murray said: ""We are excited that we will be offering a daily inter-island foot passenger service this summer."" Mr Murray said a standard adult return fare with his firm would be priced at about £67. The firm's schedule offers daily services between Guernsey and Jersey, running from 07:00 until 19:45 on weekdays (other than Tuesdays when it stops at 16:45). It will also run from 07:00 until 21:45 at weekends. Mr Murray said the new summer schedule would be subject to ""some final discussions"" with Ports of Jersey.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyjlx2e4l8o,"Anti-Muslim hate at record level in UK, report says",2025-02-19T12:03:03.016Z,Jessica Rawnsley,"Anti-Muslim hate in the UK surged to record levels last year, an organisation tracking Islamophobia has found. Almost 6,000 reports to Tell Mama were confirmed by it as anti-Muslim incidents, more than double the number two years ago, with men targeted more than women for the first time since the body was founded in 2012. In its report the organisation said there had been a ""surge in rhetoric that falsely portrays Muslims as terrorists or terrorist sympathisers"" following the Israel-Gaza conflict and Southport murders. A government spokesperson called the findings ""extremely concerning"" and said it would ""seek to stamp out anti-Muslim hatred and racism wherever it occurs"". A total of 6,313 cases of anti-Muslim hate were recorded by Tell Mama in 2024, a 43% increase on the previous year - with 5,837 of the reports verified by the group. The organisation, which describes itself as the leading agency on monitoring anti-Muslim hate crime, said it had documented a steep rise in offline incidents, with 3,680 cases reported - a 72% increase on the number two years ago. The majority of the in-person cases were abusive behaviour, with Tell Mama also recording incidents of physical assault, discrimination and vandalism. Most of the attacks took place in public areas such as streets and parks, with a minority occurring in the workplace. For the first time since Tell Mama's inception in 2012, more men than women were targeted by anti-Muslim hate and Islamophobia, the organisation said. Tell Mama said that shift reflected ""the deepening impact of harmful stereotypes that fuel societal divisions and reinforces false notions about Muslim identities"". Anti-Muslim attacks surged in the UK following both the Southport murders last July and the start of the Israel-Gaza conflict in October 2023. According to the report, more than half of the online incidents of Islamophobia last year took place after three girls were murdered at a dance class in Southport. The majority of these occurred on the social media platform X - formerly known as Twitter. Following the murders, misinformation about the assailant's identity proliferated online, fuelling civil unrest that spread across the UK. Axel Rudakubana, an 18-year-old born in Cardiff to Rwandan parents who had settled in Britain, is serving a minimum 52-year sentence for the murders. Tell Mama said that there had been a ""surge in rhetoric that falsely portrays Muslims as terrorists or terrorist sympathisers"" since both the 7 October 2023 Hamas attacks on Israel and the 2024 riots sparked by the Southport murders. Iman Atta, the group's director, called for coordinated action by the government and said: ""As anti-Muslim hate continues to be felt by a greater number of British Muslims, both at a street and online level, our work and support for victims of anti-Muslim hate is needed now more than ever."" The public must ""stand together against hatred and extremism"", she said, and urged those in positions of influence to ""consider how their language risks stereotyping communities and how it unduly influences discussions online and offline"". In response to the findings, the government said that ""attacks on and hatred against Muslim communities are completely unacceptable and have no place in our society"". A spokesperson added: ""We are absolutely determined to bridge divisions between communities and are working closely with community groups, charities, and public sector partners to tackle hatred in all its forms."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0ldgvnx3o,"New knife laws will make difference, says victim's sister",2025-02-19T11:19:44.984Z,Ruth Green and Rowan Bridge,"Stricter rules for selling knives online and tougher penalties for those who break them will make a difference, the sister of a teenager killed with a ninja sword has said. The new measures announced by the government will be known as Ronan's Law - after 16-year-old Ronan Kanda who was murdered close to his home three years ago after being stabbed in the back and chest in a case of mistaken identity. ""On the day of my brother's murder, his murderer had no problem with collecting the knives from the local post office,"" Nikita Kanda told Radio 4's Today programme, adding ""no checks"" had been made. It comes as policing minister, Dame Diana Johnson on Thursday pledged all potential avenues will be explored as part of the government's mission to halve knife crime over the next decade. Ronan was killed by fellow school pupil Prabjeet Veadhesa, after he visited a friend's house to buy a PlayStation controller in June 2022. A trial heard his attacker, who was also 16, at the time had mistaken him for his friend, their intended victim. He used a 22-inch sword he had ordered online using his mother's ID to pass security checks. It was one of nearly 30 knives and machetes he had bought using the same method over several months. As part of the new rules which are to be introduced in the spring, retailers across England and Wales will be required to report any bulk or suspicious knife purchases to police. The jail term for selling weapons to under-18s will increase from six months to two years and a new policing unit backed with £1m of funding to monitor for weapons being sold illegally on social media will also be created. Asked about the plans, his sister told the BBC that having some sort of punishment in place was ""better than nothing"", adding there needed to be more accountability for ""people who are a part of the problem but who are overlooked"". ""All I can ever do is reflect on my brother's case, and on the day of my brother's murder, the murderer, he didn't have any problems collecting his knife from his local post office, and the fact that he was under-age, so no checks were performed."" She said: ""So I really do think that these, these measures can make a difference, and they will make a difference because it will make it harder."" She described Ronan as the ""light of our life, the best brother anyone could ask for"". Since her son's death, Ronan's mother, Pooja Kanda, has campaigned for fundamental changes to the law to make it harder for people to sell and buy knives. ""The online sale of bladed articles played a crucial role in this tragedy. A 16-year-old managed to get these weapons online and sold these weapons to other people. I knew we could not go on like this."" Speaking to BBC Breakfast, Ms Kanda said she ""absolutely"" believed her son would not have died if the new legislation had been in place at the time of his death in 2022. ""The murderers would not have been able to get the weapons they were able to get so easily. Nobody was able to stop them, and they were just 16,"" she said. On the new law she said: ""Out of tragedy comes a light. The light we all need."" However, she stressed ""there's so much more we can do"" when tackling the root causes of knife crime. Introduced as part of the government's Crime and Policing Bill in the spring, the rules are in response to a review by the National Police Chiefs' Council (NPCC) into the online sale of knives. The changes will also see: Policing minister Dame Diana Johnson said ""nothing is off the table"" in regards to knife crime as she described it as ""absolutely disgraceful"" that retailers were selling knives to under 18s. Speaking about Ronan's death on the Today programme she said: ""There was no check that day when the ninja sword, the 20-inch ninja sword was collected at the post office - nobody checked it."" She paid tribute to his family, who she described as at the ""forefront"" of bringing the bill forward and said the new rules would acknowledge the ""problem"" of supply of weapons, rather than just possession, with ""proper sentencing"". The Home Office said the new measures would significantly tighten the law, which until now has been less stringent than the legislation covering the sale of alcohol, tobacco, fireworks or even scratch cards. ""It is horrifying how easy it is for young people to get hold of knives online,"" said Home Secretary Yvette Cooper. ""Even though children's lives are being lost, and families and communities are left devastated as a result."" Commander Stephen Clayman, who led the NPCC review into online knife sales, said: ""Bizarrely it is harder to buy paracetamol in some respects than it is to buy a knife - that can't be right. ""We want to make retailers more responsible for what they are selling."" The recommendations also require social media companies to be more accountable for the ""thousands of knives"" that Cdr Clayman said were being sold on platforms. ""They are being quite clever about it in the way they don't overtly sell. But they show all the knives and encourage people to move to a different [online] platform to make the transaction. ""If they are selling knives and we can prove it, we will take legal action and ask for the content to be removed."" The measures are aimed at stopping sellers like Stefan Petrescu from Southampton. He used Instagram to sell hundreds of knives. Police found receipts which revealed that Petrescu had bulk-bought more than £3,000-worth of knives, which he had then sold online. Messages from Petrescu's seized phone showed the use of social media platforms to market the knives, with buyers saying they wanted to ""shank"" (stab) or harm others. In one video, he wears a black balaclava-style mask and gloves while handling knives, advertising his stock of serrated machetes, knuckle dusters and other blades while drill music plays in the background - including the song ""Ready for War"". In October 2024, Petrescu was jailed for three years after pleading guilty to knife-related offences. The home secretary has said the government is on a ""mission"" to halve knife crime over the next 10 years. There were 262 murders involving a knife or sharp instrument in the year to March 2024, according to the Ben Kinsella Trust. Fifty-seven of those killed were under 25.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86pl3962j7o,"Cancer patients not getting right treatment, say doctors",2025-02-19T00:07:56.942Z,Nick Triggle,"Senior doctors responsible for monitoring cancer care in England and Wales are concerned failings in NHS services are contributing to up to half of patients not getting the right treatment for some cancers. In evidence provided to the BBC, the National Cancer Audit Collaborating Centre (NatCan) highlighted particular problems with prostate, kidney and colon cancers. The expert group said it had found significant variation between hospitals and warned the problems accessing nationally-recommended treatments were putting lives at risk. It carries out audits across nine major cancers - responsible for 80% of cases - and has found shortfalls across a range of different cancer types and stages. Figures shared with the BBC show: NatCan said while a minority of patients would be choosing not to have treatment themselves and others may not be well enough, that could not fully explain the scale of the shortfall or variation between hospitals. Governments in both nations say improving services is a key priority and England is in the process of drawing up a new cancer strategy, which ministers say will revolutionise services. Ian Pattison's case highlights the value of getting the right treatment. He was diagnosed with high-risk prostate cancer in 2020, at the age of 65. It had started spreading to nearby organs and he was offered the nationally-recommended treatment of hormone therapy and radiotherapy for his particular type of cancer. He said the treatment was brutal but, now aged 70, his cancer is in remission and he is enjoying life. Mr Pattison, from Durham, said: ""I was lucky that I live close to a specialist cancer centre in Newcastle where I could get the best treatment. ""It was hard going through it all and coping with the side effects but I am so thankful I got the treatment. ""I feel fit and well. I love walking, spending time with my family and looking after the grandchildren."" But Prof Ajay Aggarwal, clinical director at NatCan, which is run by the Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) for NHS England and the Welsh government, said it was concerning so many patients were not getting the recommended treatment, adding that the variation was hard to understand. ""We need to do better,"" he said. ""With cancer, we often hear people talking about what the next breakthrough is but, the fact remains, using what we have better could make a huge difference. It would extend and save lives."" Prof Aggarwal said there were likely to be several reasons for the problems and variation, including some services unfairly assuming older patients could not cope with treatment, as well as problems with staffing and capacity. He said there was evidence of smaller hospitals not always referring patients on to specialist centres where they can get treatment but added that even some of the big centres were coming up short for some cancers. But the problems, he added, were not uniform with treatment rates for some cancer types much better. RCS president Tim Mitchell echoed the concerns, saying: ""The NHS has access to world-class cancer treatments and care, but inconsistent delivery means far too many patients miss out. ""At worst, this may mean some patients are needlessly dying or in unnecessary pain.""   And cancer charities said tacking the failings was arguably more important than reducing waiting times. Eve Byrne, from Macmillan Cancer Support, said the findings were ""quite staggering"", adding that tackling the variation should be the ""number one priority"" in the forthcoming national cancer strategy. ""Getting the best care to give you the greatest chance of survival should not come down to which hospital you attend or where you live in the country,"" she said. Ms Byrne said patients should get the right care for their particular type of cancer, no matter where they are. ""We are concerned that people from deprived, rural or ethnically diverse communities could be losing out in particular,"" she said. Amy Rylance, from Prostate Cancer UK, said patients were effectively being denied their ""best chance of a cure"", adding: ""This needs to change now."" NHS England cancer director Prof Peter Johnson said: ""We know that patients' experience of cancer treatment does vary – and we are working hard to address this."" And a Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Patients should be able to access the cancer care they need regardless of where they live and we are committed to addressing health inequalities as we rebuild the NHS."" A new cancer strategy is expected to be published in the second half of the year, which Health Secretary Wes Streeting has said will revolutionise services. A Welsh government spokeswoman said it was working with the NHS to ""plan, deliver, recover and improve cancer services"". She said the audit highlighted areas where further work was needed.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgp47mpxgno,Judge 'deeply troubled' by PMQs exchange on Gazans settling in UK,2025-02-18T16:48:47.567Z,Dominic Casciani,"The most senior judge in England and Wales has said she was ""deeply troubled"" by comments made by Sir Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch over a judge's ruling in an immigration case. Badenoch, the Tory party leader, had asked the prime minister about a decision to grant a Palestinian family the right to live in the UK after they originally applied through a scheme designed for Ukrainians, saying it was ""completely wrong"". Sir Keir said he agreed, adding: ""It should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration"". But Lady Chief Justice Baroness Sue Carr said the remarks were ""unacceptable"" and conflicted with the duty of politicians to uphold the rule of law and respect the independent role of judges. A government spokesperson said Sir Keir had ""made clear that it is for Parliament to make the laws and for the government to decide policy."" Speaking at her annual news conference, Baroness Carr also said that judges' concerns about their personal security were at an ""all-time high"" - thanks to attacks on social media driven by wider misreporting of their work. The exchange between Sir Keir and Badenoch came during Prime Minister's Questions (PMQs) last week. Badenoch was critical of how an immigration judge had handled the family's application, which she said was made under a scheme designed for Ukrainians fleeing the war. The case has been widely misreported and misunderstood. Badenoch said: ""A judge has now ruled in their favour. That is not what the scheme was designed to do. ""This decision is completely wrong, and cannot be allowed to stand. Are the government planning to appeal on any points of law, and, if so, which ones?"" The full reading of the judgement reveals that the family of six - a mother and father, and their four children - had sought permission to live with a British relative who proved he was able to house and financially support them. Part of their case had been that they were political opponents of Hamas, which is banned in the UK under terrorism laws. The family, whose home in Gaza was destroyed by an air strike, have been granted anonymity. Their initial application had been incorrectly made using a form reserved to help Ukrainian families reunite. They eventually won permission to stay under entirely separate general human rights considerations. These allow families from any background to make a case to reunite if there are compelling reasons to do so outside of standard immigration schemes. This detail, including the specific risks the family say they faced, was not spelled out at PMQs, with Sir Keir saying the case had been one that had been dealt with under the Conservatives. Replying to Badenoch, Sir Keir said: ""Let me be clear: I do not agree with the decision. The leader of the opposition is right that it is the wrong decision. ""She has not quite done her homework, however, because the decision in question was taken under the last government, according to their legal framework."" He went on: ""It should be Parliament that makes the rules on immigration; it should be the government who make the policy. That is the principle. The home secretary is already looking at the legal loophole that we need to close in this particular case."" The prime minister has not specified what the ""legal loophole"" is that he wants to close. Meanwhile, the two Upper Tribunal judges, who granted the family permission to reunite in the UK, said that their decision was not creating a Palestinian settlement scheme, but dealing with a complex and exceptional case. They had not been presented with any evidence from the government that this family's unusual case would open ""floodgates"". The UK currently has schemes for some Afghans, Ukrainians and people from Hong Kong to come to the UK, but no route for Palestinians. Reflecting on the PMQs clash, Baroness Carr said on Monday that ""both the question and the answer were unacceptable"". ""It is for the government visibly to respect and protect the independence of the judiciary,"" she said. ""Where parties, including the government, disagree with their findings, they should do so through the appellate process."" She also said MPs, ""just like the governing body, have a duty to respect the rule of law"". Her officials had now written to the prime minister and the lord chancellor's offices. Responding to Baroness Carr's comments, Badenoch said ""politicians must be able to discuss matters of crucial public importance in Parliament"" - and that such debate ""doesn't compromise the independence of the judiciary"". ""This is not just some legal loophole that can be closed, but requires a fundamental overhaul of our flawed human rights laws,"" she said in a statement on X. A government spokesperson said: ""Where the law is not working as we think it should be, the government will take action to tighten up the rules - and that is what we are doing"". ""As a former chief prosecutor, the prime minister's respect for the judiciary, the role they play in our democracy and the rule of law is beyond question,"" the statement added. Making a wider point about concerns over the safety of judges, Baroness Carr said it was ""not acceptable for judges to be the subject of personal attacks for doing no more than their jobs"". ""Their job is to find the facts on the evidence before them and apply the law as it stands to those facts,"" she told reporters. ""If they get it wrong, the protection is a challenge on appeal. If the legislation is wrong, it is Parliament's prerogative to legislate."" ""It is really dangerous to make any criticism of a judgment without a full understanding of the facts and the law,"" the lady chief justice said - adding that judges are ""public servants acting independently"" and that, ""frankly, judges deserve better""."

Despite the social media teasers showing celebrities with pots of jam from Meghan, the previous brand name American Riviera Orchard seems to have reached a sticky end. On a social media post, Meghan said the newly-named product range would be a joint project with Netflix, which is showing her cooking and lifestyle series, With Love, Meghan next month. ""'As ever' means 'as it's always been' or some even say 'in the same way as always,'"" said Meghan's post. The recorded message, delivered in close-up by Meghan, emphasises the continuity with her former, pre-royal, lifestyle blog, the Tig. She said that the new venture would be ""beautifully weaving together everything I cherish - food, gardening, entertaining, thoughtful living, and finding joy in the everyday"". Prince Harry, who has been at the Invictus Games in Canada, is heard briefly off-camera in the background of the recording of the Instagram posting. Their three-year-old daughter Lilibet is also seen in the distance, against a sunny Pacific sky, on the accompanying As Ever website. The previous name American Riviera Orchard had been a reference to the part of California where she lives with Prince Harry - and Meghan said it ""limited me to things which were manufactured and grown in this area"". That name had been promoted since April 2024, when celebrities published pictures on Instagram of jars of strawberry jam, in a launch that tried to preserve a sense of mystery. But there had also been reports of delays because of trademark problems with the original title. If this latest announcement means the lid is going to come off a new jam war, the Californian contender will be up against Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle Strawberry Preserve, both at £7 and Highgrove Organic Preserve at £6.95. The new As Ever brand will be a partnership with Netflix, with reports that the TV company is going to open shopping outlets which will sell merchandising connected to its shows. ""Of course there will be fruit preserves, I think we're all clear at this point that jam is my jam,"" said Meghan. ""But there's so many more products that I just love that I use in my home and now it's time to share it with you, so I can't wait for you to see it."" The launch of Meghan's TV show was delayed by the wildfires in California, with the US state the backdrop for the series, which is expected to be a mix of cooking, hosting tips and celebrity friends and is due to run on Netflix from 4 March. It is five years since Meghan and Prince Harry stepped down as working royals, becoming financially independent in the United States. Meghan says in her social media post, she has ""poured my heart into"" this forthcoming product range. Meghan divides public opinion, with strong reactions on social media from supporters and opponents. Her fans have saluted her independence and creativity, while her opponents have already labelled the brand as ""whatever"". Appropriately, she signed off her own post: ""As ever, Meghan.""

Robert Scott Clive, known as Scott, was last seen on 10 October 2002 following a night out in North Shields, North Tyneside, where he had moved to from Stranraer, Scotland, a few months earlier. A murder investigation was launched despite no body being found. Northumbria Police officers are conducting searches at a property in North Shields' Coronation Street, alongside door-to-door inquiries. The current occupant, who moved in after 2002, had been found alternative accommodation, the force said. Mr Clive, who lived in Prudhoe Terrace and worked as a labourer, was 30 at the time of his disappearance. Officers say they have reviewed hundreds of hours of CCTV footage and spoken to several people in their efforts to piece together his movements. Last June, a 49-year-old man was arrested in connection with the investigation. He has since been released on bail pending further inquiries. Unconfirmed sightings in the early hours of 11 October 2002 placed a man matching Mr Clive's description near the banks of the River Tyne. His mother, Tricia Clive, speaking last year, said the family were ""still in limbo"" as they did not believe he fell into the river. Det Insp Mark Atherton, who is leading the case, said he was determined to provide the family ""with the answers they deserve"". ""After a review of the information we have, we are refocusing our efforts in the Coronation Street area and an address we know he visited on the night he went missing. ""We are grateful to the current occupant of that premises for their cooperation, and that of the wider community as we conduct our enquiries. ""We are also asking anyone who lived in Coronation Street at the time to get in touch as they may have relevant information without even realising.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8977l253lo,"'Tough on crime' policies behind prison crisis, says review",2025-02-18T10:43:09.077Z,Dominic Casciani,"Successive governments trying to look ""tough on crime"" have driven the rising prison population which forced the early release of thousands of inmates last year, a review suggests. The report by the Independent Sentencing Review found governments over the past 25 years jailed more criminals, despite evidence it does not prevent re-offending. The review, led by former lord chancellor David Gauke, also found there were ""knee-jerk"" decisions to issue longer sentences in an effort to show government action. Mr Gauke warned that unless radical changes are made this year, prisons in England and Wales could run out of cells again by spring 2026. ""It's only a matter of time before, once again, prison numbers will exceed capacity,"" Mr Gauke told the BBC's Radio 4 Today programme. England and Wales has one of the highest prison population rates in western Europe, according to the report. Despite an overall decline in crime since the mid-1990s, England and Wales' prison population has almost doubled between 1993 and 2012, the review found, while reoffending has stayed stubbornly high. The government launched an early prisoner release scheme in September last year as part of an emergency plan to tackle overcrowding. It saw eligible prisoners serving more than five years automatically released after only 40% of their fixed-term sentence, rather than the usual 50%. The government then commissioned the report to examine how prisons became so full, and to consider ways to ease overcrowding by giving tougher punishments outside of prison. The panel's recommendations are due in spring. The review found that the early release scheme freed up enough spare cells for newly-remanded or convicted criminals, but that headroom will disappear by next year, even with more prison places being built. Mr Gauke said: ""Last year we were confronted with the consequences of decades of haphazard policy making and underinvestment in the criminal justice system - bringing it to the brink of collapse. ""For too long politicians have operated in a vacuum, increasing sentencing for individual crimes without considering the knock-on impact on the wider system."" He said the system had failed victims, and that while punishment would always be a central aim of the criminal justice system, ""prison is not the only form of punishment"". Figures show that almost six out of 10 offenders jailed for less than a year go on to break the law again - a cycle of criminality that had been feeding more and more people into the prison population. In contrast, fewer community sentences have been handed out by courts and there has been decades of under-investment in probation teams, who are charged with offenders in the community, and proven rehabilitation programmes. As a consequence, more money has been spent on emergency overcrowding measures, including building more jails, rather than on punishment in the community and cheaper programmes aimed at stopping offending in the first place. Mr Gauke's review found that the prison population began to balloon as Labour and Conservative administrations competed to introduce tougher and tougher measures aimed at jailing people. ""Over the last 25 years, the political landscape has been increasingly dominated by a 'tough on crime' narrative that has focused on longer imprisonment. In tandem, politicians have implemented legislative and policy changes which have inflated sentencing,"" it reads. Mr Gauke told the BBC that the last 30 years have seen ""something of a bidding war between political parties as to who is prepared to lengthen sentences the most"". ""As a consequence, we've seen our prison population essentially double over that time,"" he added. ""We now have the highest incarceration rate in western Europe and with that comes consequences, not least the fact that prison is pretty expensive."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwy7y1n73ngo,Kate and children show drawing skills by sharing portraits,2025-02-17T16:08:55.214Z,Sean Coughlan,"The Princess of Wales and her children, Prince George, Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis, have revealed their artistic skills in four portraits of each other. It's believed to be the first time that a drawing by Catherine of one of her children has been shown in public - with a picture of her six-year-old son, Prince Louis. The royals drew the portraits as ""a moment of connection"" to ""spend time looking at and focusing on one another"" while being creative, a social media post from Kensington Palace added. The pictures are a follow-up to Catherine's recent visit to the National Portrait Gallery, as part of her early years education project, Shaping Us. The princess had joined a class of five-year-olds going around an exhibition encouraging children to portray themselves and to understand their own emotions. The four pictures have been issued without revealing the artist and subject - but the more grown up work would appear to be Catherine's picture of a sleeping Prince Louis. Catherine studied A-level art at school and then history of art at St Andrews university. Prince Louis has already shown his own creativity, with the recent release of his photograph of his mother wrapped up warm on a cold winter's day. These latest pictures, like Louis's photograph, were issued on Prince William and Catherine's social media account. A picture of Catherine sitting in an armchair seems likely to have been drawn by 11-year-old Prince George, while another portrait of Catherine with multi-coloured hair seems to be the work of nine-year-old Princess Charlotte. The bright red portrait by Prince Louis could be either Catherine or Charlotte. The pictures are highlighting the exhibition launched by the princess at the National Portrait Gallery in London, which encourages children to think about their relationships and feelings. The princess travelled to the gallery in a school minibus and helped the young visitors as they took part in art activities, intended to help them develop emotional skills. ""These skills are key throughout our lives, shaping who we are, how we manage our thoughts and emotions, how we communicate with and relate to others, and how we explore the world around us,"" said the message on social media, alongside the pictures. ""Drawing portraits with children can provide a moment of connection as you spend time looking at and focusing on one another, as well as being creative,"" the post continued. There is a long tradition of painting among the royals, with King Charles an enthusiastic painter. He has also been the subject of numerous works, including Jonathan Yeo's portrait last year, with its striking shades of red.

National Lottery operator Allwyn said the lucky ticket-holder came forward over the weekend to claim their prize of £65,341,620.50. The operator added that Saturday's £7.4 million Lotto jackpot had also been claimed by a single ticket-holder. Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at Allwyn, said: ""It's been an astonishing weekend of millionaire-making, which promises to keep me and my team very busy."" The EuroMillions winner matched all seven numbers on Friday's draw - 04, 14, 31, 36 and 38 with Lucky Stars 03 and 10. Fourteen UK players also netted £1 million each in Friday evening's EuroMillions UK Millionaire Maker draw. Mr Carter said on Monday that seven of those winners are still yet to claim their prize. ""We're asking everyone to check their tickets and we're very much looking forward to meeting all the lucky winners soon,"" he added. Friday's ticket-holder is the second UK EuroMillions jackpot winner of 2025. Earlier this month, one anonymous ticket-holder scooped a prize of more than £83.4m after it was left unclaimed for 13 days. Winners must claim their prize within 180 days of the draw. Successful players can decide whether they want to be named or remain anonymous upon claiming the prize. The UK's biggest EuroMillions jackpot, worth £195m, was claimed by an unnamed winner in July 2022. That same year, a then record-breaking £184m was won by Joe and Jess Thwaite from Gloucester, with a Lucky Dip ticket for the draw on 10 May. There are nine EuroMillions prizes yet to be claimed by UK ticket-holders, according to the National Lottery's website, with the largest standing at £1m."

Fresh guidance states anyone entering the UK illegally having made the dangerous English Channel crossing - on a small boat or hiding in a vehicle, for example - will be refused citizenship. Christina McAnea, general secretary of Unison, and nine Church of England bishops are among 147 signatories of a letter, seen by the BBC, to the home secretary urging her to rethink the policy. They wrote that the government must instead focus on ensuring refugees ""are welcomed and integrated into British life"". The Home Office says the government has merely strengthened rules that were already in place on who could obtain citizenship. The letter argues that citizenship is ""not just a legal status"" but ""a tangible fulfilment of the promise of safety, dignity, and opportunity"". ""When refugees become citizens, they feel a greater sense of belonging as full members of their communities with a stable future for themselves, their children and generations to come."" Referring to a riot at a Holiday Inn Express in Rotherham last August, it says that part of the response to that violence ""should be on creating integrated communities"". It went on: ""Labelling refugees, who through no fault of their own have had to put their lives at risk on flimsy vessels, or have had to hide in the backs of lorries to reach safety on our shores, as a type of second-class individual will simply breed division and distrust. ""It risks playing into a toxic politics that pits 'us vs them' and is then manipulated by the far right to bring hate and disorder to our streets."" As well as Ms McAnea of Unison - Labour's most generous union backer in the 2024 general election campaign, donating £1.49m - other signatories include the bishops of Chelmsford, Leicester, Gloucester and Dover. The chief executives of the Refugee Council and Refugee Action have also signed it, alongside Islamic Relief UK and other faith leaders, including rabbis from the Conference of Liberal Rabbis and Cantors. The government's new policy means anyone applying for citizenship from 10 February, having previously entered the UK illegally will be refused regardless of how long ago they arrived. Previously, refugees who arrived via irregular routes would have to wait 10 years before being considered for citizenship. It has also been criticised by Labour MP Stella Creasy. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""There are longstanding rules that can prevent those arriving illegally from gaining citizenship. ""The government is strengthening these measures to make it clear that anyone who enters the UK illegally, including small boat arrivals, faces having a British citizenship application refused."""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz509dqrqo,Islanders reflect on history of diving boards,2025-02-16T07:11:06.206Z,Connor Belford Georgina Barnes,"Swimmers and divers have been sharing their memories of the historic Valette bathing pools in Guernsey. The pools have been the subject of debate since the only remaining diving board on the site was deemed unsafe by the Health and Safety Executive (HSE). Following protests, the removal of the diving platform has been delayed by four weeks to give the States time to ""consider the issues"". Patsy Self said she had been using the diving board since she was around 10 or 11 years old, during the 1950s. ""I think it's a shame really, because it's part of Guernsey history and the diving boards have been there...all through our childhood,"" she said. Mrs Self added: ""Talking to families on Sunday morning they were quite sad to see what was left of it going."" The La Valette Bathing Pools were once famous for diving competitions, with the Guernsey Swimming Club (GSC) setting up high-diving boards at the Ladies' Pool in 1925. But the boards started being removed in the 1970s and all that remains is one low board. The charity Vive La Vallette, which was formed in 2019 to regenerate the facilities at the pools, said it was ""disappointed"" the remaining diving board had been set to be removed without further consultation. It said the bathing pools were Victorian-era intertidal structures. ""The pools are filled by the sea twice a day at the higher tides and, as the tides drop, they provide a calm swimming area for the public to enjoy,"" a spokesperson said. Margaret Jones, who is also a swimmer and a childhood friend of Mrs Self, said she was uncertain about the changes. She said: ""I don't think change is always for the best. If it is for the best, then it's a good thing. ""But I think a lot of the time it's change for change sake, and that's probably what's led to the demise.. of the diving boards. ""They're taking away something and not replacing it with an alternative... why not improve it and let people use it?"" she said. Jo Norman, who began volunteering at the GSC in 1976, said La Vallette was ""a special place"" for her. She said: ""I remember swimming there as a child and my children learnt to swim down there too with the Guernsey Swimming Club. ""We took part in the floodlit galas, where the community would come together to join in and watch the incredible fire dives from the high boards."" Ms Norman said memories would remain at the pools forever. ""There was always such a great atmosphere down at the pools and I believe it still remains at the heart of swimming in Guernsey,"" she said. The GSC said the Vallette pools were a hotspot for its events and competitions during the 1960s and 1970s. It added that its centenary year and 125th anniversary were held at the pools as well as the ""occasional swim session"" and annual polar bear swim. Barbara Quevâtre, whose late husband Hayward was a diver at the pools, said she was worried about how young people would find the changes. She said her husband went to the pools to practise on the diving board ""every lunch hour"" before most of the boards were removed in 1989. ""When they came down...he was devastated, so he didn't go down there anymore,"" she said. Mrs Quevâtre added: ""It changed his life altogether really."" She said her husband was ""older"" when he started diving - and said he was ""too tall to make a neat diver."" Mrs Quevâtre said it would be ""a shame"" if the remaining diving board was completely removed. ""There's a community down there. It hasn't been the same since the diving stages came down."" ""With the diving stages taken down as well...it's not the same, you've got your winter swimmers, your all-round swimmers...but there's not the sense of a community somehow,"" she added. Mrs Quevâtre said the pools had ""lost their charm"" since the removal of the diving stages. ""It's very nice to have wheelchair access and all the rest of it, but for me it's lost its well, charm I suppose. ""It's lost its sort of nature. To me, it's not the same in Guernsey as it was, and various areas around the coast to me have changed sufficiently that Guernsey isn't Guernsey anymore for me.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq0x30kkldo,"UK and EU countries must spend more on defence, says Lammy",2025-02-15T18:24:35.961Z,George Sandeman,"The UK and EU countries must spend more on defence, with Europe facing an ""existential question"" even in the event of a negotiated peace in Ukraine, David Lammy has said. The foreign secretary told the Munich Security Conference ""Putin will not go away"", and that, while it was positive 23 Nato countries were now spending at least 2% of their GDP on defence, ""we all know we have to go upward"". He said the UK was ""absolutely"" committed to spending 2.5% and would set out a ""pathway"" to achieving that goal in a few months' time. Lammy's comments come after US Vice-President JD Vance told the conference on Friday that Europe must ""step up in a big way to provide for its own defence"". In his address, Vance said it was his belief the greatest threat facing Europe was not from Russia or China but ""from within"". He said many European governments, including the UK's, had retreated from their values and ignored issues such as migration and free speech. Speaking on Saturday during a panel discussion on European security, Lammy told the audience that successive US presidents had asked Nato members to increase defence spending and emphasised the importance of continued support for Ukraine. Appearing alongside his counterparts from France, Germany and Poland, Lammy said: ""There is a question for Europe. If we look at GDP combined, it's about 0.01% that we are spending on that fight for Ukraine. ""We know this is the frontline, not just for Ukraine, but for Europe. We know too that even when we get to a negotiated peace, Putin will not go away. So this is an existential question for Europe."" He said that he understood why the US was now focusing on its security interests in the Pacific, where China is a major power both economically and militarily. ""People have given the impression that the Euro-Atlantic and the Indo-Pacific are tied just at this moment - it was tied in the Second World War,"" he said, mentioning that 30,000 British soldiers died in the region during that conflict. ""We recognise that pacing threat as the United States bears down on that issue. So of course Europe has to do more."" Earlier, in an article for The Telegraph, Lammy and Defence Secretary John Healey said the West had done too little in the past when Russia first invaded Ukraine in 2014. They said the UK and Europe now needed to ""do more together"" to ""share the burden"" of security across the continent. The UK had committed an additional £150m towards military aid for Ukraine as well as new sanctions on people close to Russian President Vladimir Putin as he ""only responds to strength"", they added. Meeting Vance on Friday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said he wanted ""security guarantees"" ahead of planned peace talks between the US and Russia. US President Donald Trump said he had spoken to Putin on Wednesday and agreed to ""work together, very closely"" to bring an end to the war in Ukraine. It has been nearly three years since Russia invaded. Zelensky has proposed what he described as an ""army of Europe"" to secure the continent. He told the conference on Saturday: ""As we fight this war and lay the groundwork for peace and security, we must build the armed forces of Europe so that Europe's future depends only on Europeans, and decisions about Europe are made in Europe."" He added: ""Europe needs a single voice, not a dozen different ones."" Asked during the panel discussion about the security guarantees being considered, Lammy said a long-term military and financial partnership might be best. ""The UK has just signed a 100-year partnership with Ukraine and I would encourage Donald Trump, and the Ukrainians, to look very carefully at a deepening partnership over the next generations,"" he said. ""Why? Because the best deal, and the best security guarantee, is binding US industry, business and defence capability into their future. ""That is what will make Putin sit up and pay attention and that is what is attractive to a US president who knows how to get a good deal."" Among the other possible measures mentioned by experts is the deployment of a peacekeeping mission to Ukraine. Lord Dannatt, who was head of the British Army from 2006 to 2009, estimated that around 100,000 soldiers would be needed for such a mission and that the UK might need to contribute 40,000 of them. ""We just haven't got that number available,"" he told the BBC Radio 4's The Week in Westminster. ""Our military is so run down at the present moment, numerically and as far as capability and equipment is concerned, it would potentially be quite embarrassing."" Sir Richard Shirreff, Nato's former deputy supreme commander, told Radio 4's Today programme that ""100,000 [troops] is probably the minimum"". Asked about calls to significantly increase defence spending, he said: ""This is a defining moment for European militaries [and] European governments""."

She said EasyJet's schedule changes were not based on how the the facility was ""managed or run but was rather a ""business decision"" made by the firm, she said. The airline is set to reduce flights between Ronaldsway Airport and Liverpool and Manchester between April and November following a fall in demand. Michelle Haywood said while she was ""comforted"" the carrier would continue to serve the island, she ""understands the frustrations"" of those whose travel plans had been disrupted. An EasyJet spokesman previously said the airline continually reviewed its schedule across its network ""to align with demand"". While its flights to London Gatwick and Bristol have been unaffected, in April the airline will run up to 12 flights a week to and from Manchester, and 10 flights a week to and from Liverpool. Haywood said there had been a ""real difference"" in the types of flights the airline wanted to provide, and ""by adding 33 new routes from the UK into Europe they need the planes to be elsewhere"". ""Some of the take-off and land journeys have been a casualty of that change, its easyJet's decision to make, its unfortunate the Isle of Man is losing out slightly,"" she said. But the minister said the Strategic Air Services Policy, which was recently passed by Tynwald and maintains an open skies policy, allowed the island ""freedom to negotiate with airlines to explore new route"". ""Work is ongoing with the airport and the Department for Enterprise over improving routes and getting increased connections into other destinations,"" she added.

""Back home taking care of our babies, and missing my Valentine,"" Meghan wrote on social media, saying she was ""beyond proud"" of his sports event for disabled and wounded veterans. The Prince and Princess of Wales also put out their own social media message, with a single heart emoji and a picture of the couple holding hands and kissing. The picture of Prince William and Catherine was particularly poignant, as a still from the video that she had issued last September alongside an announcement that she had completed her cancer treatment. It's a slightly retro-image, with autumn colours and Enid Blyton shorts, taken in woodland in Norfolk and showing Prince William kissing Catherine. Prince Harry and Meghan are also kissing in their picture on social media, in a black and white photo of the couple behind what could be the two dishes linking the US and the UK, with a burger and fries and fish and chips a culinary marker of their own transatlantic ""special relationship"". Meghan added the tag #lovewins to her Valentine's message and signed off ""As ever, M."" There's also another important part of the romantic mood, with what looks like a big glass of red wine. Although as far as can be seen, neither of the couples had bought a bunch of garage flowers on the way home and laboured over a witty message. Why say it with flowers when you can say it on social media, with 4.6 million followers to offer their hearts?

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8p3dd5ez3o,'Trapped in our home' - Doorbell camera captures neighbour's abuse and threats,2025-02-14T18:07:28.730Z,Tarah Welsh,"It's the early hours of the morning in March 2024 and Ben is woken by shouting and swearing. It's aimed at him, and he says it feels threatening. It's the woman who lives in the flat below. An hour before, Ben could see and hear threats on the screen of his doorbell camera. It's been rung multiple times and he says he's barely slept. This is the 78th incident on a meticulous log Ben has been keeping since the anti-social behaviour started about a year before. He says he's been ""abused"" and ""physically threatened that we would be shot, stabbed and have our knees broken if we leave the house"". He says he now lives in a constant state of fear. Ben bought the ex-council flat in Wandsworth almost three years ago and around six months later, Drina Gray moved into the flat below. He says the issues began soon after. As well as threats, he says he and his girlfriend Emma are plagued by noise from her flat below, including the tenant's dogs barking, music, shouting and vacuuming all through the night. He says the disruption even affected his ability to work. ""Because I was so sleep-deprived, I was getting to work quite late. I couldn't focus on my job. Ultimately due to just so much stress, so much anxiety, I lost my job."" Ben eventually got a new job but says he's been left feeling ""really helpless"" and says the whole experience has had a detrimental impact on his mental health. Emma adds that she too has been left ""terrified"". ""We just feel trapped,"" she says. Ben and Emma are not alone in experiencing anti-social behaviour. According to the latest official data from the Crime Survey for England and Wales, 36% of people experienced or witnessed anti-social behaviour last year, up from 34% the previous year. Ben is a leaseholder in a council-owned block and says many of his complaints to Wandsworth Council went unanswered. He says he feels ignored, despite mentioning concerns about mental health and violent threats. Ben and Emma have called the police to their address more than 20 times and say while local neighbourhood officers have been helpful, they feel failed by the system and ""let down"" by response times when they call 999. In August, an official review panel - made up of police and public officials - found there had ""not been good communication between agencies"" and ""none of the agencies has taken ownership of the case"". Wandsworth council has accepted it ""could have acted more swiftly."" Ben has now complained to the housing ombudsman. Over the last year, across the UK, the Housing Ombudsman has ruled that of the 809 anti-social behaviour cases he has presided over, 67% of social landlords hadn't dealt with the issue to an adequate standard. Richard Blakeway, the Housing Ombudsman, said: ""Anti-social behaviour can cause unimaginable distress to people, have a profound impact on the community, and be complex for landlords to manage."" He added that he repeatedly sees cases where ""failures prolong issues and leaves residents feeling unheard and continuing to suffer"". The BBC showed some of Ben's footage to Baroness Helen Newlove, the victims' commissioner for England and Wales. ""It shows that the system isn't working, once again, to protect innocent people,"" she says. Baroness Newlove's husband Garry died in hospital after being attacked outside his home in Warrington, Cheshire, in August 2007 by three youths after he went to speak to a gang he believed had been vandalising his wife's car. She says 17 years later, agencies still don't understand the impact anti-social behaviour has on victims. She fears it will take another death for it to be taken more seriously and for it not be treated as ""low-level"" crime. She says her inbox is full of complaints from victims about anti-social behaviour. Baroness Newlove hopes new powers in the Crime and Policing Bill, being drafted this year, will improve protection for victims. In December, Ben's neighbour, Drina Gray, pleaded guilty to charges including harassment and criminal damage and will be sentenced in March. Ben says the anti-social behaviour has continued and Gray has been rearrested multiple times since. She returned to the flat after the first arrest but the BBC understands she is temporarily staying elsewhere as per her bail conditions. The council says following the court case, it is now seeking possession of the property. But Ben says he has no idea when Gray will be permanently moved. In a statement, Wandsworth Council said it ""takes criminal and anti-social behaviour very seriously, and we work with partners to both support residents and to take the appropriate action against those responsible. ""This is a complex case where housing officers have been working closely with a number of different agencies, including the Police, to resolve the matter."" A spokesperson for the Met Police said: ""Any form of anti-social behaviour is taken seriously and we work in partnership with local authority colleagues to ensure that issues raised are addressed"". Addressing Ben and Emma's specific case, the spokesperson said the police were working to ""ensure that the offender is brought before the courts when there is evidence to support it"". The BBC contacted Drina Gray for comment."

It follows months of uncertainty over what schedules will be offered between Guernsey and Jersey by Danish firm DFDS and Brittany Ferries. Sponsorship director of Guernsey Raiders RFC, Chris Gnapp, said they had taken the ""financial risk"" of chartering a boat for the rugby union team. DFDS previously said it was still finalising its schedule and it had been delayed during a legal challenge over the tender process by rival firm Brittany Ferries. The BBC has contacted both DFDS and Brittany Ferries for comment. Mr Gnapp added: ""We have had to take the financial risk of chartering this boat over because there is simply no other way of getting our training teams over to Jersey to play rugby."" Meanwhile director of Guernsey Netball, Sally Carns, said the lack of certainty about travel had been a ""logistical nightmare"". Ms Carns said: ""We can't allow any supporters to travel because we booked out all the flights for that day. ""On the Sunday, we have had to charter a plane, which, again, the financial risk of not filling it sits with ourselves as a charity. ""Logistical nightmare is the phrase of the week."" She said questions were being asked and discussions were going to be had. During the coming summer months, there is expected to be a third ferry service provided by Islands Unlimited, which has said it will offer a daily foot-passenger service. Chad Murray, managing director, said: ""From what we found, there is a strong desire to have consistent, regular travel between the islands."" Mr Murray said teams had been working on the new ferry service for about 18 months. He said there was demand for services ""that allow long day trips to each of the islands, not only for tourists and visitors, but also for island communities"". Mr Murray added the current owners of the vessel it planned to use were still operating it, so they were negotiating an ""exact date"" of when it would be released. He said it would be ""unreasonable"" to set the booking system live until they had confirmation on the date, adding he hoped it would be live in two to three weeks."

Mika, a three-year-old Tibetan Terrier from Guernsey, claimed the hearts of islanders at the Trinity Royal Showground in Jersey on Saturday. Her success now means she will be placed in the open bitch class at Crufts, regarded as the ""world's greatest dog show"" by organisers. Mika's shared owner Chrissy Le Moignan said the category ""means she's against the big girls now, so what will be will be."" Mika has attended Crufts each year with this year's show taking place at Birmingham's NEC between 6 and 9 March. Discussing Mika's temperament, Ms Le Moignan said: ""She loves the show ring, she's an absolute dream. ""She's a monster outside the show ring but put her in the ring and she knows what to do. She's a real showman and she loves it."" Mika's title-winning performance on Saturday meant she was able to follow in the paw-steps of her half sister, who won the same title two years prior. Discussing the win, Mika's other shared owner and vice president of Guernsey Kennel Club, Paige Le Moignan, said: ""I'm absolutely ecstatic, we didn't expect it at all in any way, shape or form. ""You should never go into any competition expecting to win it but everyone is there for the same reason, everyone wants to win, and we were absolutely astounded when she won."" The Channel Island Dog of the Year award is decided over the course of 10 shows throughout the year, four in Guernsey and six in Jersey. In order to quality for the final show, a dog must win its group. ""To get an invitation for the event is huge anyway,"" said Ms Le Moignan.

Beth was attacked with a machete by her former partner, a neo-Nazi misogynist who used his MI5 role to coercively control her. We revealed on Wednesday that MI5 gave false evidence to three courts over its handling of the man - a paid informant known only as agent X. MI5 has now issued an ""unreserved apology"" describing what happened as a ""serious error"" - adding it took full responsibility. But speaking for the first time since then, Beth - not her real name - asks: ""Where's my apology?"" She believes she only matters to MI5 because she is ""kicking up a fuss"" by taking a legal case against the service and ""throwing a spotlight on the way that they behave"". ""But otherwise, if I were to just go quietly away, they'd never think about me again,"" she told the BBC. Beth says she would like to see X - a foreign national - to be personally ""held accountable for all the crimes he committed"", and for there to be a review of how he was to go unpunished and start a new life abroad. Beth's legal case claims MI5 breached her human rights by failing to protect her from agent X. She is pursuing a formal complaint at an independent court, called the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT). Judges ruled much of the case should be held in secret after MI5 said it does not confirm agent identities - under a principle known as neither confirm nor deny (NCND) - and had not done so with X. Secret IPT sessions would be closed to Beth and her lawyers, and therefore prevent her from knowing what MI5 says in response to her claim. ""It felt completely offensive to be told that my case would have to be held in private and that I wouldn't be privy to any of the information because that's how they operated, as if they're allowed some special licence to completely breach my human rights."" However, I revealed on Wednesday that I had been told by a senior MI5 officer that X was an agent. The disclosure happened when MI5 contacted me to try to stop a BBC story about his extremism. The IPT was one of the three courts to which MI5 gave false evidence, including by stating it had never confirmed X's agent status to me. MI5 first lied in 2022, when the government took me and the BBC to court in an attempt to block us reporting on agent X's wrongdoing - and succeeded in banning us from identifying him. Beth says the false evidence ""proves what MI5 are capable of"". ""[It] feels like all my worst suspicions have been confirmed,"" she adds. ""Everything that I was told by X about them, at the time we were together, has actually been proven to be the case - that they are unscrupulous people who will stop at nothing to achieve what they want."" Beth met agent X on a dating site. But, over time, he became physically, mentally and sexually abusive. After attacking Beth with a machete, in a case that was dropped by prosecutors after police failed to obtain the video of the attack, X left the UK while under police investigation and began work for a foreign intelligence agency. ""What concerns me so much is that, as far as we know, he is a free man,"" says Beth. ""I don't want other women to have to put up with things like this. It's disgusting."" She believes MI5 has a particular type of power that enables it to avoid transparency like other organisations. MI5 says it is conducting an internal investigation into the false evidence, which may result in disciplinary action. The senior MI5 corporate witness who gave false evidence says he thought he was telling the truth. The Home Secretary, Yvette Cooper, has also announced an independent external review of how MI5 gave false evidence. It is being conducted by Sir Jonathan Jones KC, former head of the government's legal service. Beth's case will now head back to the specialist IPT court, which will reconsider the decision to rule that MI5 can refuse to confirm that X was an agent and therefore keep evidence secret from her. Until this is decided, the full case will not be heard. When I was first in contact with Beth, she had recently suffered a breakdown because of X's behaviour towards her. She has come a long way in the years since. The legal process is re-traumatising but necessary, Beth says. ""I've already lost years of my life to X and his abuse - there seems to be no end to it. ""But it seems like it's the only way that I might, potentially, get some sort of reasonable justice."" When asked about the wider implication of her case, Beth says it is ""really important"". She says there is ""so much violence carried out on women by men,"" adding, ""whatever we can do as a society against it needs to be done"". ""I am one of the lucky ones because I've been able to speak about it and I've been listened to and so many don't get listened to.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d5wj9l8e2o,UK to deny citizenship to small boat refugees,2025-02-13T12:20:37.991Z,Mark Easton,"The government has toughened up rules making it almost impossible for a refugee who arrives in the UK on a small boat to become a British citizen. New guidance states that anyone who enters the UK illegally having made a dangerous journey, which could be via boat, but also by means such as hiding in a vehicle, will normally be refused citizenship, regardless of the time that has passed. In a statement, the Home Office said the strengthened measures made it clear that anyone who entered the UK illegally would face having a British citizenship application refused. But the change has been condemned by the Refugee Council and some Labour MPs - including Stella Creasy who said the change ""meant refugees would forever remain second class citizens"". Changes, first disclosed by the Free Movement blog, were introduced to guidance for visa and immigration staff on Monday. The changes mean that anyone deemed to have entered the country illegally - including those already here - will not be able to apply for citizenship. Described as a ""clarification"" to case worker guidance when assessing if a claimant is of ""good character', it says: ""Any person applying for citizenship from 10 February 2025, who previously entered the UK illegally will normally be refused, regardless of the time that has passed since the illegal entry took place."" Another new entry to the same guidance says: ""A person who applies for citizenship from 10 February 2025 who has previously arrived without a required valid entry clearance or electronic travel authorisation, having made a dangerous journey will normally be refused citizenship. ""A dangerous journey includes, but is not limited to, travelling by small boat or concealed in a vehicle or other conveyance."" Previously, refugees who had arrived by irregular routes would need to wait 10 years before being considered. Under UK law, it is now an offence to enter the country without permission. This is despite the UK being signatory to international law treaties, such as the 1951 UN Refugee Convention, which state that asylum seekers and refugees should not be penalised for illegal entry.  The government's new border security bill, which scraps the Conservatives' Rwanda plan and boosts police powers against people smugglers, cleared its first vote in the House of Commons on Monday. The Border Security, Asylum and Immigration Bill sets out Labour's plan to treat people smugglers like terrorists, and creates a new crime of endangering another person during an illegal crossing in the Channel. The Home Office also published footage of enforcement teams raiding 828 premises, including nail bars, car washes, and restaurants, as part of a UK-wide crackdown on illegal working earlier this week. Commenting on the new guidance for refugees, Labour MP Creasy said she worked with a young man who after fleeing Syria and gaining a degree is now ""contributing to our society, and has now got British citizenship"". ""This process would deny that,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Creasy also claimed the change to rules on citizenship for refugees would ""deny"" Paddington Bear from obtaining a British passport. The fictional character famously arrived in the UK by stowing away on a boat from his home in Peru. ""Essentially it would deny, well, frankly, Paddington,"" Creasy said. ""Paddington did the same thing. He came by an irregular route, but we gave him sanctuary but wouldn't give him a passport."" Lord Blunkett, the former Labour home secretary, urged the government to ""reflect on the societal and cohesion aspects"" of the policy. He called on ministers to consider ""the impact on children and their right to UK citizenship and the statelessness which would arrive for individuals if their birth country refused to renew or retain their nationality"". ""Surely this Parliament should have a say in such a big change,"" he told the House of Lords. In response, Home Office minister Lord Hanson of Flint said children will be ""considered sympathetically under existing legislation to date"". The Home Office confirmed that the new restrictions will ""likely not apply"" to children, ""given illegal entry is normally considered outside a child's control"". However, each citizenship application will continue to be assessed on a case-by-case basis, it added. The Refugee Council estimates the guidance will prevent at least 71,000 refugees from obtaining British citizenship. Enver Solomon, CEO of the charity, said the government's move ""flies in the face of reason"". ""The British public want refugees who have been given safety in our country to integrate into and contribute to their new communities, so it makes no sense for the government to erect more barriers. ""We know that men women and children who are refugees want to feel part of the country that has given them a home, and support to rebuild their lives. ""We urge ministers to urgently reconsider."" Meanwhile, immigration barrister Colin Yeo argued on social media that it is a ""clear breach of the Refugee Convention"". Although the Conservatives have yet to respond to the government's decision, Tory leader Kemi Badenoch told the BBC last week that she believes the right to citizenship and permanent residency ""should only go to those who have demonstrated a real commitment to the UK"". Badenoch spoke about her proposals to toughen up citizenship rules by making it more difficult for new immigrants to be able to permanently settle in the UK. A Home Office spokesperson said: ""There are already rules that can prevent those arriving illegally from gaining citizenship. ""This guidance further strengthens measures to make it clear that anyone who enters the UK illegally, including small boat arrivals, faces having a British citizenship application refused."""

A total of 48% of forces found drivers going more than three times the 30mph limit, while 90% had clocked people driving at 60mph. The highest recorded speed on 30mph roads was 122mph in South Yorkshire. For 20mph roads, the top speed was logged by North Wales Police at 88mph. The highest recorded speed on any road was 167mph on a 70mph stretch of the M1 in Leicestershire. The largest difference between the speed recorded and the speed limit was 161mph on a 50mph in Somerset. The data came from Freedom of Information requests the RAC made to 45 police forces relating to the period from January 2023 to the end of August 2024. Forty forces provided data. The 10 highest speeds clocked on 30mph roads were: RAC road safety spokesperson Rod Dennis said: ""Although this data is a snapshot, it shines a light on the incredibly dangerous actions of a few, that are putting law-abiding road users at serious risk. Thankfully, the police were on hand to catch these drivers."" Chief Constable Jo Shiner, the National Police Chiefs' Council lead for roads policing, said choosing to drive above the speed limit amounted to ""reckless, selfish and completely unacceptable"" behaviour. ""We know that some incidents of going over the speed limit can be genuine mistakes or errors, but the speeds cited here are clearly drivers taking deliberate decisions to travel at excessive speeds, putting everyone at risk,"" she said. A spokesman for the Department of Transport said there were tough penalties in place for drivers who speed. ""While our roads are among the safest in the world, we are committed to improving road safety, and recently relaunched our Think! campaign with a focus on speeding, particularly on rural roads."" Speed is the biggest factor reported in fatal road collisions, according to government data. In 2023 speed contributed to 888 fatalities, and more than 39,000 collisions of all severities. More than 24,000 vehicles were caught on camera being driven at more than 100mph (161km/h) between 2019 and 2023, police data shows."
https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-63642856,Black mould: How dangerous is it in the home and how can it be treated?,2025-02-13T10:02:00.000Z,,"Landlords for social housing in England will have to fix damp and mouldy properties more quickly from October, the government has announced. The rules will eventually cover private landlords as well. Campaigners called for stricter rules after two-year-old Awaab Ishak died because of mould at his Rochdale home in 2020. Mould - sometimes referred to by the American spelling mold - is a microscopic fungus that grows in damp places. Mould spores are found everywhere, and are released in their thousands into the atmosphere. Signs of mould at home include fuzzy black, white or green patches on the walls, and a damp and musty smell. People living with mould are more likely to suffer from respiratory illnesses, infections, allergies or asthma. Inhaling or touching the spores that mould releases into the air can cause an allergic reaction, such as sneezing, a runny nose, red eyes and a skin rash. Mould can also trigger asthma attacks and cause coughing, wheezing and breathlessness. The NHS in England spends an estimated £1.4bn every year treating illnesses associated with living in cold or damp housing, according to a 2021 report from building research body BRE. Those more at risk from mould include the elderly, children and babies, as well as people with existing respiratory illnesses and some skin problems. Condensation is the leading cause of mould in homes across the UK. It most commonly occurs in parts of the home where there are high moisture levels, such as bathrooms and kitchens. When air cools, water vapour forms into water droplets as it comes into contact with cold surfaces. These surfaces can include uninsulated external walls or windows. If left untreated, the surface can become damp and create the conditions for mould to grow. Older and poorly insulated properties are more prone to this. Mould can also be caused by daily tasks which create excess moisture such as showering, cooking and drying washing indoors. Taking shorter showers and wiping down surfaces afterwards can help, as can improving ventilation and opening windows or using an extractor fan when cooking. It is also important to check for leaky pipes or gutters which can make the problem worse. In December 2020, two-year-old Awaab Ishak died after prolonged exposure to mould in his home. He lived in a one-bedroom flat in Rochdale with his father Faisal Abdullah and Faisal's wife Aisha Amin. Mr Abdullah reported the mould to his housing association, Rochdale Boroughwide Housing (RBH), in 2017, but was told to paint over it. Awaab was taken to Rochdale Urgent Care Centre on 19 December that year with shortness of breath, and died a few days later. All landlords - private and social - already have a duty to keep their homes fit for human habitation. But after Awaab Ishak's death, campaigners called for stricter measures. Awaab's law was first passed in July 2023 under the previous Conservative government, but had not taken effect by the time of the 2024 general election. Labour has said that from October 2025, the rules will apply to social landlords - generally local councils or housing associations. These landlords will have to address damp and mould hazards that pose a significant risk of harm to tenants, within fixed timescales. From the same point, they will also have to address all emergency repairs - whether related to damp and mould or not - within 24 hours. New rules setting a timeframe for dealing with non-emergency repairs such as excess cold and heat, structural collapse, fire, electrical faults and hygiene issues will take effect in 2026. More hazards will be added in 2027. Landlords who fail to act can be taken to court and ordered to pay compensation. The Housing charity Shelter criticised the government's decision to phase in the new legislation. It said it leaves social housing tenants at risk from poor quality accommodation. The government's Renters' Rights Bill, which is currently making its way through Parliament, will extend the new rules to cover private landlords. Ministers previously said they hoped the bill would be passed by summer 2025."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25m231n8xo,How I exposed MI5's lie about its violent abusive agent,2025-02-12T14:47:03.049Z,Daniel De Simone,"Spies lie, but they are not meant to get caught. On a wet Friday evening in December, three MI5 lawyers sat in a room at the BBC's headquarters in London. On the other side of the table were the BBC's lawyers and me. No MI5 officers were present, after we refused a request for the meeting to be secret. After exchanging strained smiles, we got down to business - and proved to them that the Security Service had been giving false evidence to the courts. The meeting took place after I told MI5 in November that we were planning to report it had lied and offered it a chance to comment. In response, the Security Service insisted - aggressively so - that it had been entirely honest. What it hadn't realised until the December meeting, was that I had hard evidence to prove its position was false. The revelation of the false evidence matters because it raises serious concerns about how reliable MI5's evidence is in the courts, where assessments from the Security Service are given enormous deference. It also raises fresh doubts about whether MI5 can continue with a core policy of secrecy - after we revealed it was applying it selectively. The organisation's first lie came when the government took the BBC to the High Court in 2022 to block a story about a right-wing extremist working as an MI5 agent - the term for a paid and authorised informant. Former Attorney General Suella Braverman failed to prevent us publishing the story but succeeded in getting an order preventing the man from being identified, having argued he would be in danger. As a result, the man is known publicly only as X. We argued he should be identified so women could be warned about such a predatory and violent man. X had used his MI5 role to coercively control his ex-partner, known publicly by the alias Beth. He was physically and sexually abusive, and was filmed threatening to kill her and then attacking her with a machete. During the legal proceedings, MI5 said it could publicly neither confirm nor deny (NCND) whether X was an agent, in line with its long-standing policy. In public, MI5 emphasises the fundamental role of the NCND policy, which it says it follows in relation to its agents. Any exceptions are said to undermine the secrecy that protects such men and women and to damage national security. But then, during the proceedings, a senior MI5 officer - a deputy director of the organisation and senior counter-terrorism officer, known in court as Witness A - mentioned some phone calls involving me. In a corporate witness statement, Witness A said an MI5 representative had spoken to me at an earlier date. This came after the Security Service became aware the BBC intended to include X in an investigative story. Witness A said that, during the discussions, I said I had suspected X was a state agent, but that MI5 had ""neither confirmed nor denied"" whether this was the case. He did not explain who initiated the discussions - it was MI5. Nor did he say how the Security Service had become aware of the planned BBC story - X had told them. In my own detailed witness statement, I said this account did not correspond with my recollection in various respects. I did not go into further detail, because - without any waiver of legal privilege - I had been advised by lawyers it would not affect the key issues in the dispute, which centred on the claimed risks to X if he were identified by the BBC. The BBC team also only had access to parts of the case - some evidence and hearings were in secret. During one secret part of the proceedings, to which the BBC team and I did not have access, security-cleared lawyers appointed on our behalf were also told by MI5's lawyers that it had maintained its neither confirm nor deny policy in the calls with me. But I knew that what Witness A said about me in his statement was untrue. I knew that MI5 had not abided by NCND. To be honest, I resented its lie. We can also now report that MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum called the BBC director general Tim Davie, in December 2021, to cast doubt on the BBC's planned story about X. Sir Ken's own notes of the calls, which were served as part of the government's evidence in the 2022 High Court case, record him claiming the intended story was ""inaccurate as well as reckless"". However, the story was accurate. The judge found I had taken proper steps to assess whether the story's various elements were true and that it was ""comfortably"" shown to have a credible evidential foundation. Despite not being allowed to identify X, the High Court ruled we could report the results of our investigation. It showed that X had abused Beth and another former partner, and that he was a dangerous extremist. At about the same time, Beth lodged a formal complaint about her treatment by MI5 with the Investigatory Powers Tribunal (IPT), an independent court with the power to investigate human rights claims against the Security Service. It was at this court where MI5 would lie again. The IPT often sits in secret without claimants, their legal representatives, journalists or the public present, to consider evidence deemed sensitive for national security reasons. In the case of X, this meant all the information which confirmed he was an MI5 agent. Lawyers for the IPT are meant to represent the interests of claimants in the closed sessions. But Kate Ellis from the Centre for Women's Justice, who is representing Beth, says the system is inherently problematic. ""You're not entitled to know what's being said about you. There might be things that are being said that you could disprove. You might be being called a liar and you're not entitled to know any of this,"" she says. All Beth would be able to know at the end of the case is whether she had won or lost, and she would never really understand why, Ms Ellis says. Beth asked the tribunal that MI5 drop its policy of neither confirming nor denying. Otherwise, her lawyers argued, most of the case would have to be heard in closed sessions. They said X had already disclosed his role to Beth and used it to coerce her. But lawyers for MI5 argued it would mean the Security Service being forced for the ""first time ever"" to confirm to a third party in legal proceedings whether someone was an agent. Last summer, the IPT ruled against Beth. While it accepted that maintaining NCND had an impact on her right to a fair hearing - because she cannot counter evidence presented in secret - it said the policy ""fundamentally relies upon the absolute consistency of its application"". It added that MI5 had ""gone to extensive lengths throughout these and the BBC proceedings to uphold the NCND policy"". MI5 repeated its false evidence to a third court when Beth sought a judicial review of this IPT ruling. From then, I was determined that the truth about MI5's behaviour had to come out. I had first met Beth when she was very unwell in the aftermath of X's abuse and coercion. I knew how far she had come since then and wanted to do right by her. I began working with a small team of BBC lawyers to develop a strategy. The truth is that, in several calls with me, a senior MI5 officer had departed from the NCND policy by announcing to me that X was an agent and inviting me to meet him. The officer said he had been legally authorised to tell me the information. The calls were part of MI5's attempt to persuade me not to identify X as an extremist as part of our planned investigative story. They came after I had sent X a letter, detailing his involvement in violent extremism and giving him an opportunity to respond. In November last year, after working with the BBC legal team for several months, I wrote to MI5 to say we planned to report that the Security Service had lied to the courts, and that it had departed from NCND during phone calls with me. I did not say how I would prove these claims. At the same time, the BBC lawyers wrote to the office of the new Attorney General, Lord Hermer, to tell them we planned to apply to the court to make public the part of the MI5 witness statement in which false evidence was given. On 25 November, a government lawyer responded on behalf of MI5 to me, saying that MI5 ""stands by the entirety of the account given to the High Court in Witness A's witness statement"". It said that the Security Service's position remains that ""there was no such departure"" from the NCND policy and suggested that MI5's evidence had been ""carefully considered"". I was surprised by this response. MI5 was gambling that I could not prove what I had set out. It was a gamble the Security Service was about to lose. We responded saying that MI5 was invited to a meeting where it could inspect the evidence we would rely on in our court application. We took this unusual step to allow MI5 to consider whether to consent to changing the terms of an injunction put in place at the end of the case against us in 2022. And so it came to that meeting on 13 December, when the three lawyers acting for MI5 came to the BBC's offices at London Broadcasting House to meet me and the BBC legal team. They read and listened to the relevant material, which comprised a handwritten note of a first call from MI5, an email I had sent to the MI5 officer following that call, and an audio recording of a second call the next day. I took the MI5 team through the evidence in chronological order. My impression was that they appeared slightly buoyed when shown a handwritten note, deflated by the email, and defeated when faced with the 40-minute audio recording - as each step revealed our evidence was stronger. My handwritten note showed what the purpose of MI5's call was - to tell me that X was an agent. The MI5 officer who rang me said he had been ""authorised"" to tell me, something which he said would otherwise have been ""illegal"". This information was volunteered to me by MI5, not in response to a query by me about whether X was an agent - which was not something I had asked either to X or to MI5. I had never spoken to the MI5 officer before. He was not a source or a friend. In fact, as I would find, he was seeking to protect X and gave a false impression about the man's risk to women. The officer, who worked closely with MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum, characterised X as someone who was informing on extremists for the Security Service, not an extremist himself. The phone request was that we should not go ahead with our proposed story because MI5 said it was untrue. My impression was that MI5 had called assuming I would agree to this request with little further challenge. Instead, during the conversation I took issue with MI5's characterisation of X, whom I regarded - and still regard - as a genuine extremist. I also raised with MI5 the violence, abuse and coercion that X had engaged in within his personal life. I did not say how I knew about these matters, nor name anyone affected by them. Those matters had not been in my letter to X and I think the MI5 officer was surprised when I raised them. I made clear how concerned I was about these matters. I was troubled MI5 was seeking to protect someone I regarded as a danger to women, children and the wider public. The call concluded with me saying I would need to consider what he had requested, including in internal editorial discussions. The MI5 officer told me he was going to make checks based on concerns I had raised about X. He asked that I send him an email summarising the information about the man's personal conduct which I had mentioned during the phone call. The email I sent soon afterwards said: ""As discussed, the male concerned was and is the subject of allegations of violence and fraud involving a British female. The alleged violence extends up to attempted murder. ""He is alleged to have engaged in domestic abuse and sexual violence, expressed paedophilic tendencies, and caused serious mental harm to people in his life."" The ""attempted murder"" referred to the machete incident. At that time, I had been told by Beth about the incident but had not seen the video of it. I would later obtain the video and take investigative steps to corroborate what I had been told, something MI5 could have done had it wanted to. The next day there was a further phone call from the same MI5 officer. I recorded the conversation for note-taking purposes, in accordance with the BBC's Editorial Guidelines, because I wanted a full record of what was said. I also did not trust MI5. In the recorded call, the senior MI5 officer claimed the service ""pretty strongly assess"" that X had not been recently violent. My research would go on to prove this assessment was wholly false and the machete attack had been just the year before. The officer said: ""We do cast serious doubt on the most recent allegations of acts of violence, particularly against that individual."" He emphasised that MI5's assessment was that ""we are of the belief that actually he hasn't been involved in recent acts of violence"", although he qualified that by saying they could ""never categorically say that was definitely the case"". During the call, he also accepted that X was not stable and had been involved in ""lots of… drug gang activity"" previously, ""will have been involved in a bunch of things"", and came ""from a very shady past"", implying he had been violent. Despite all this, MI5 characterised X's relationship with Beth as ""slightly problematic"", suggesting she had ""mental health issues"".  When I wrote to X, I mentioned a vile and alarming online post he had made, about severely sexually exploiting women - using language too offensive to repeat. The MI5 officer claimed that when X had posted this, he had been temporarily de-authorised - meaning he was not at that moment working for MI5. I explained that, based on what I knew of X, the post was what he was really like, demonstrated his propensity for violence against women, and that was the cause of my concern with him. The officer accepted the post ""strays over the line"", but seemed not to understand the obvious logic that, if it had been posted when X was briefly de-authorised, this only demonstrated X's true nature even more. He was a genuinely dangerous misogynist - it was not an act put on for MI5. The MI5 officer seemed to be most fascinated by how we had worked out X's true identity. I found this surprising, given I was talking to MI5, and explained it was basic journalism. During the call I also told the officer that X had been on a dating site under an alias used for his MI5 work. I said that I had already been told that X was an informant, separately to MI5's call. The MI5 officer seemed concerned by this information. However, he also invited me to meet X and learn about his work as an agent. He made this offer twice during the call. I ignored both offers. My impression was that this was a crude attempt to offer me something exciting - a meeting with an MI5 agent - which would make me forget my concerns. I considered it wholly inappropriate given X's misogyny, sadism, paedophilic tendencies, violence and abuse. Five days after the December meeting where we played the recording of the call to the MI5 lawyers, the government wrote to the BBC saying MI5 now took the view its evidence ""may be materially incorrect, and that it is important the position is corrected as soon as possible"". The BBC decided the best way to ensure the court and government had the relevant evidence was to make our application to publish the false testimony. The application included a new witness statement from me. We filed it on Christmas Eve. MI5 reversed their position entirely in response. In a new witness statement submitted to court, the MI5 deputy director Witness A said he ""sincerely"" apologised for giving incorrect evidence. He said the false information ""reflected my honestly held belief at that time, and which accurately reflected the information I was given"". He also said that ""it is now apparent to me that MI5 did, in fact, depart from NCND during the discussions"". At this time, he has not explained how he came to give false evidence, despite the government saying two months ago that it was working ""quickly"" to provide an explanation. Witness A has not identified who provided the information which he relied on. There has also been no explanation about who was responsible for authorising the disclosure of X's status to me. Our evidence indicates various MI5 officers were aware of the discussions with me, including case officers and senior counter-terrorism staff. In addition, the government's policy relating to planned departures from NCND says agencies should inform relevant Whitehall colleagues, including the Cabinet Office, in a ""timely fashion"". This means the Cabinet Office and Home Office – as the Whitehall department responsible for MI5 – should have known in advance about the departure from NCND for agent X. In a statement on Wednesday, the government said ministers and civil servants are not ""routinely consulted on private disclosures by the agencies"" and that they had not been on this occasion. The Security Service is conducting an internal investigation and the government has launched an external review recommending changes to ensure courts are provided with accurate information in future. But there are real concerns about how transparent the two investigations will be. And, if a review now needs to recommend how to ensure MI5 gives accurate evidence to courts, some will wonder what has been happening until now. The question is particularly concerning since courts are required to grant particular discretion to MI5 on questions of national security. Courts and inquiries dealing with such matters frequently sit in secret, yet deal with crucial issues of liberty, life and death - fatal attacks that were not stopped by MI5, people whose British citizenship has been stripped from them, people ordered to live under strict anti-terror powers. MI5 has issued an ""unreserved apology"" to the BBC and all three courts that have been provided with false evidence. ""MI5 takes full responsibility,"" its legal submissions state. It said it understands the importance of ensuring that any evidence it provides is truthful, accurate and complete. And it added: ""It is acutely conscious of the particular responsibilities that MI5 bears in this regard, and that the court must be able to trust completely any evidence it provides."" These revelations come at a time of increased scrutiny of the NCND policy, following an inquiry into the British state agent known as ""Stakeknife"", a killer and torturer who informed on the IRA during the Troubles in Northern Ireland. Security forces and the government have refused to confirm or deny that Stakeknife was Freddie Scappaticci, who died last year, although the fact is well known. Jon Boutcher, the former head of the inquiry who wrote its interim report, said NCND ""seems to have assumed a totemic status"" within government and the security forces and to have become ""an implacable dogma or mantra with the qualities of a stone wall"". He said the policy ""assumes lawful conduct on the part of the security forces"", which is ""generally a safe assumption"", but which may need ""external testing and verification"". His report recommended the government should review, codify and define the proper limits of the NCND policy in relation to identifying agents in the context of historic cases in Northern Ireland. The government has yet to respond to the recommendation. Beth's case already had a wider implication for MI5 in relation to how it assesses and manages agents, particularly those who pose a risk of violence to women and girls. Now it has taken on wider implication still – about how much MI5's evidence can be taken at face value and relied on, and whether NCND needs to change. The new evidence shows MI5 has not abided by NCND in the case of X and, in fact, wholly abandoned the policy while dismissing the agent's abusive and extremist conduct. It shows MI5 knew what kind of person he was, and captures its dismissive attitude to concerns about his abuse and violence. And it is due to bring to an end to Beth's judicial review case, which had been considering whether MI5 should have been allowed to maintain NCND. MI5 itself has recommended that decision now be considered afresh by the original court, the IPT. Beth will return to court, seeking the truth amid official secrets and lies.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cew5rwpw579o,MI5 lied to courts to protect violent neo-Nazi spy,2025-02-12T13:59:51.583Z,Daniel De Simone,"MI5 lied to three courts while defending its handling of a misogynistic neo-Nazi state agent who attacked his girlfriend with a machete, the BBC can reveal. Arguing for secrecy, the Security Service told judges it had stuck to its policy of not confirming or denying informants' identities. In fact, MI5 had disclosed the man's status in phone calls to me, as it tried to persuade me not to investigate the man - known publicly only as agent X. The service aggressively maintained its position until I produced evidence proving it was untrue, including a recording of one of the calls. The BBC can reveal: In an unprecedented admission, MI5 has now issued an ""unreserved apology"" to the BBC and all three courts, describing what happened as a ""serious error"" and saying ""MI5 takes full responsibility"". There will now be pressure on MI5 director general Sir Ken McCallum to explain what he knew, given that the officer said he had been legally authorised to disclose X's role. It also raises concerns about the reliability of MI5's evidence in the courts and the sustainability of one of its core secrecy policies. For agents ""to keep protecting us, we must protect them and their identities from all those who would do them harm,"" said Sir Ken - in a statement released after this article was first published. ""The use of agents is difficult, human work that is governed by legislation and tightly overseen,"" he added. Beth's case will now head back to the specialist court, which is investigating if the Security Service breached her human rights by failing to protect her from X's abusive and coercive behaviour. It will reconsider whether it was right to rule that the evidence should be heard in closed sessions which she would not be able to attend. Beth's lawyer, Kate Ellis from the Centre for Women's Justice, told the BBC: ""I think this raises real concerns about MI5's transparency, about whether we can trust MI5's evidence to courts."" MI5's lie can be revealed after the BBC applied to the High Court to report false evidence in a corporate witness statement by a deputy director in the Security Service, known as Witness A. His statement said the service had maintained its long-standing approach to neither confirm nor deny the identity of agents - a policy known by the initials NCND - and gave a false account of the MI5 officer's calls with me. During a short hearing granting permission on Wednesday at the Royal Courts of Justice in London, Mr Justice Chamberlain said the relevant MI5 evidence had been ""false"". Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has appointed Sir Jonathan Jones KC, former head of the government legal service, as an ""independent external reviewer"" to investigate how MI5 came to provide false evidence to the courts. He has also been asked to recommend any changes needed to ensure that courts are provided with accurate information in future by the Security Service. After we reported in 2022 how X terrorised his partner, Ms Cooper - then shadow home secretary - had called for an ""independent assessment"" of the case, looking at the way concerns about ""the appalling and dangerous crime of domestic abuse"" were handled by MI5. MI5 says it is conducting an internal investigation into the false evidence which may result in disciplinary action. Following Wednesday's hearing, we can now report that Sir Ken McCallum called the BBC's director general Tim Davie in late 2021, to cast doubt on the BBC's original planned story about agent X. Sir Ken's own notes of the calls, part of government High Court evidence from 2022, recorded him claiming my intended story was ""inaccurate as well as reckless"". The BBC stood by the reporting and, after the government took us to court, a judge found I had taken proper steps to assess whether the story's various elements ""were true"" and that it was ""comfortably"" shown to have a credible evidential foundation. Sir James Eadie KC, representing the government at court on Wednesday, said the internal MI5 disciplinary process ""indicates the seriousness with which this is being taken"". He said the court will be updated in April. The significance of the disciplinary process for the individuals involved is ""pretty obvious"", Sir James said. The BBC has called into question the lack of explanation from MI5. In legal submissions today, the BBC invited the court to take further steps to ensure that this ""serious breach is properly investigated"" and that the results of any investigation are brought into the public domain. Exposure of MI5's false testimony will also damage its credibility in other court proceedings, where judges are obliged to give enormous weight and deference to the Security Service's evidence. These often involve secret hearings which are closed even to those most affected - including Beth, people whose relatives have been killed in attacks and people whose UK citizenship has been stripped from them. MI5 has acknowledged the issue, saying in legal submissions on Wednesday that it is ""acutely conscious of the particular responsibilities that MI5 bears"" and that courts must be able to ""trust completely any evidence it provides"". The Security Service maintains that the NCND policy is essential to maintain national security and keep agents safe. But the BBC revelations will add to concerns about the way the policy is being used, including that it may stand in the way of agents being held accountable when they abuse their positions or commit crimes. Because the senior MI5 officer told me disclosure of the agent's status had been legally authorised, it means it had been signed off by lawyers and other senior figures in MI5. The Home Office and Cabinet Office should also have been informed, according to the policy for departures from NCND. After Wednesday's hearing, a government spokesperson said: ""Ministers and civil servants are not routinely consulted on private disclosures by the agencies and were not on this occasion."" Meanwhile, in a written statement to Parliament, Home Secretary Yvette Cooper said it was ""clearly a very serious matter to provide incorrect information to the court"" but the government ""maintains and supports the principle of neither confirming nor denying allegations about whether individuals may or may not be operating on behalf of the UK intelligence agencies"". In a new witness statement to court, the MI5 deputy director Witness A said he ""sincerely"" apologised for giving incorrect evidence. He said the false information ""reflected my honestly held belief at that time, and which accurately reflected the information I was given"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2mz3j1e34o,"Church missed opportunity to hear victims, says bishop",2025-02-12T13:10:35.099Z,Ben Hatton,"The Church of England's failure to adopt a fully independent safeguarding model was a missed opportunity to make clear it has listened to victims, the bishop tasked with leading on the issue has said. The Bishop of Stepney, Dr Joanne Grenfell, who is lead bishop for safeguarding, had put forward a motion to the General Synod for all Church-employed safeguarding officers to be transferred to a new independent body. Dr Grenfell told BBC Radio 4's Today programme she was ""very disappointed"", but that the Church had nonetheless adopted changes that amount to a ""big step forward"". Representatives of survivors branded the outcome a ""punch in the gut"" for victims of abuse and said it showed the Church had decided to ""keep it in the family"". It comes as the Church has faced intense scrutiny for its safeguarding practices in recent months after the the former Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby resigned over his handling of an abuse case. On Tuesday the Synod, the Church of England's governing body, voted overwhelmingly for a less independent option which will see the creation of an independent central safeguarding team, but with local diocesan and cathedral safeguarding officers remaining with their current church employers. Dr Grenfell told the BBC: ""On the one hand I'm really disappointed, as were many, that Synod missed the opportunity to send an unequivocal message to victims and survivors and the wider nation that we hear their pain and concerns. ""On the other hand, what we did vote to get on with, an independent scrutiny body, is actually quite a big step forward in itself. ""But we need to do that further work around operational independence, and I'm really committed to doing that."" The Synod had been expected to vote on a model backed by Prof Alexis Jay - who previously chaired the national Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse and another model. However, following an amendment, the Prof Jay-backed model - which proposed that all safeguarding staff would be entirely independent of the Church - was not voted on at all, and a less ambitious proposal was adopted. Bishop of Blackburn Philip North, who proposed the amendment to endorse the less independent option while work was done to see if the other one was ""legally deliverable"", described the latter as ""eye-wateringly complex"" and said it could take years to implement. But Dr Grenfell said: ""I don't think we can hide behind those complex structures, that's just not good enough for victims and survivors... ""What I'm concerned about, is that it sounds, it feels to victims and survivors who I have spoken to, that we didn't hear what they were saying and I really want to say to them 'I hear you and we will continue to do this work'."" The Survivors Trust group said public trust in the Church to effectively safeguard children ""has been totally lost"". ""Church leaders must reconsider their approach and take immediate steps toward genuine, independent safeguarding reform,"" it said. Andrew Graystone, an advocate for abuse survivors, accused the Church of ""shocking arrogance"" and said the Synod had ""voted for a measure that will leave the power of bishops completely unchanged and unchallenged"". Dr Grenfell added the Church is going through a ""really painful and necessary time of reckoning"" and there is a ""huge amount to think through before we appoint a new Archbishop of Canterbury"". The Church has faced criticism for its handling of safeguarding issues, with a damning report into serial abuser and Christian camp leader John Smyth leading to Mr Welby's resignation. The Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell, who has temporarily taken on most of Mr Welby's responsibilities, has also faced criticism over his handling of an abuse case. Mr Cottrell has said he supports ""independence in safeguarding"" and was ""disappointed"" that it would now happen in ""two stages"". He said he would ""fully commit"" himself to ""implementing Synod's decision and making it happen"". Both the models that had been proposed for changing safeguarding at the Synod took into account the recommendations of independent reports, including those by Prof Alexis Jay and barrister Sarah Wilkinson, the Church previously said. Also known as the Church's parliament, the Synod meets up to three times a year to debate and pass measures governing how the Church works. It is made up of 478 members who are elected every five years. Correction 14 February 2025: This article originally incorrectly stated the Synod had been expected to vote on a proposal for safeguarding by Prof Alexis Jay and barrister Sarah Wilkinson. Sarah Wilkinson previously conducted an independent review into the failure of the Independent Safeguarding Board but this did not involve any specific proposals for future safeguarding models for the Church of England. Prof Jay backed a model of full independence. We have amended our article to make this clear. "

The hapless superhero first appeared in Nutty comic in 1980 and has featured in the Beano since 2012. In the special edition of the comic, Tindall is depicted wearing a matching blue and yellow suit while teaming up with Bananaman to save Beanotown from a rampaging troll. The 46-year-old ex-England international is married to Zara Tindall, daughter of the Princess Royal. Tindall said: ""Bananaman's 45th birthday is a reminder that fun, laughter, and a bit of mischief never go out of style, and sharing laughter with kids is timeless."" He reflects on his childhood and his rugby career in an editor's letter in the comic. The father-of-three also writes: ""My job now is being a dad and I love it. ""It's important to set a good example, so I play pranks on the kids and their mum."" His letter also encourages children to take on a sport if they have the chance. Bananaman was originally conceived as a playful parody of traditional superheroes, being strong and able to fly but famous for epic failure."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8pe5q5q5zo,The cafe that is now the very last of its kind,2025-02-12T06:27:33.381Z,Gemma Sherlock,"Walk around any UK town centre and you are likely to find at least one of the major coffee shop chains' estimated 4,000 outlets. What you will not find anywhere other than Ellesmere Port in Cheshire is a National Milk Bars café. While the chain was never of a scale anything like that of Starbucks, Caffé Nero or Costa Coffee, it was, for a time, a staple of high streets across the north-west of England and Wales. Upon buying the café in the Port Arcades shopping centre, Alisan San had no idea that he was not only trying to keep a business afloat, but was taking on the challenge of keeping a brand alive as well. National Milk Bars were the brainchild of Welsh dairy farmer Robert ""Willie"" William Griffiths. In the early 1930s, the milk bar phenomenon reached London from the USA. Griffiths saw glasses of milk being sold over smart counters for a few pence a glass, and decided to take the concept back home to Wales. Griffiths and his wife Florence opened the first National Milk Bar in Colwyn Bay in 1933, and ran the chain from the Woodlands farm in Forden, near Welshpool, for a number of years. In their heyday there were 17 National Milk Bars dotted across Wales and the north-west of England, selling dairy-based treats including milkshakes and cream cakes. Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham were all home to a National Milk Bar, and the Liverpool branch – once said to have been paid a visit by the Beatles – is immortalised on the façade of a building on Lime Street that replaced the demolished Futurist cinema. But as tastes changed, so did National Milk Bars' fortunes. And but for the Ellesmere Port outlet, the brand would be consigned to the history books. ""You come in and you feel as though you're amongst friends,"" says regular customer Joy. ""Everybody knows each other by name"". ""We are here every day, every day bar Sunday,"" says Mavis. ""Hopefully we are not going to lose this. Hopefully this will keep going"". Owner Alisan was a chef before he bought the last surviving National Milk Bar. The 45-year-old may have changed the menu and modernised the interior a little, but the signage on the front is the same as it was when the branch opened when the shopping centre was built in the 1980s. Now it faces competition from the major high street brands, with a Caffe Nero having taken up one of the units in the Port Arcades. But he is hopeful that its now-unique charm will see the brand through a few more years. ""For some people, it is more than a coffee shop,"" he says. ""We are like a family here. Everybody knows each other"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98y011dy0yo,Church of England rejects fully independent safeguarding,2025-02-11T19:59:34.916Z,Aleem Maqbool Nathan Williams,"The Church of England's governing body has rejected a fully independent safeguarding model to deal with abuse cases. General Synod members instead adopted an alternative proposal described as a ""way forward in the short term"" ahead of a move to full independence in the future. But child safety expert Prof Alexis Jay - who had called for a fully independent model - described the decision as ""deeply disappointing"" and ""devastating for victims and survivors"". The vote comes after a turbulent period for the Church, which has seen the resignation of former Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby over his handling of an abuse case and criticism of Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell's links to another. Mr Cottrel, who has stepped in as temporary head of the Church, said he supported ""independence in safeguarding"" and was ""disappointed"" that it would now happen ""two stages"". He added that he would ""fully commit"" himself to ""implementing synod's decision and making it happen"". The Church has been accused of failings over the way it dealt with cases of sexual and physical child abuse spanning decades and launched a review of its safeguarding procedures. The Synod had been expected to vote on a model backed by Prof Alexis Jay - who previously chaired the national Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse and another model. However, following an amendment, the Prof Jay-backed model - which proposed that all safeguarding staff would be entirely independent of the Church - was not voted on at all, and a less ambitious proposal was adopted. That will see the creation of an independent central safeguarding team for the Church - but with diocesan and cathedral safeguarding officers continuing in the same roles. The alternative model would have also made the Church's safeguarding officers around the country part of that independent body, independent of church organisations. Both the models that had been proposed for changing safeguarding took into account the recommendations of independent reports, including those by Prof Alexis Jay and barrister Sarah Wilkinson, the Church previously said. Given the turmoil and negative attention the Church has garnered over recent months following major abuse scandals, adopting a more ambitious model would have undoubtedly been an opportunity to send out a clear message that it really was serious about making the Church a safer place. Throughout the debate, many in the chamber – including Mr Cottrell, who has been under pressure and scrutiny himself – implored the synod to take up that opportunity. Earlier, Prof Jay had said the Church risked falling further into crisis if it failed to adopt the more independent system for keeping people safe. Speaking to BBC News after the vote, Prof Jay said: ""It will be devastating for victims and survivors, whose trust and confidence will absolutely not be restored as a consequence of the decision. ""In fact, it is more likely to alienate them."" Some opponents of the more independent safeguarding model said they were simply worried it could not have been implemented. Bishop of Blackburn Philip North - who tabled the amendment slimming down the choice put before the synod to one option - argued that the simpler model could be implemented more quickly. He described the other option as ""eye-wateringly complex"" and said it could take years to implement when the Church and nation were ""demanding change now"". He added that while the church implemented the changes - which would allow for a ""far greater degree of independence in safeguarding"" - a fully independent model was still ""very much on the table"" in the longer term. However, at this crucial juncture for the Church, the optics of making a commitment to be as ambitious as possible might have been far better than what they have ended up with. Instead, they the Church appears to have been far less bold - but with a promise they will try to do better in the future. The vote has been strongly condemned by campaigners who have called for sweeping changes to how the Church deals with abuse. Lucy Duckworth from the Survivors Trust told BBC News: ""It is a devastating blow, not just for the victims and survivors of clerical abuse but for the one million children who attend the 4,600 schools under the Church of England's power today. ""This is a shameful disregard for the lifelong suffering that their employees and clergy have caused. ""I feel really let down, speaking both as a survivor of clerical abuse as well as a campaigner and policy adviser who represents survivors."" Andrew Graystone, a victim and survivors' advocate, said the decision to reject a fully independent safeguarding model was a ""punch in the gut for victims and survivors of church abuse"" and accused church leaders of ""shocking arrogance"". Correction 14 February 2025: This article originally suggested that the Synod had been expected to vote on separate proposals for safeguarding by Prof Alexis Jay and barrister Sarah Wilkinson, with the Wilkinson proposal subsequently adopted. However Sarah Wilkinson's 2023 independent review into the failure of the Independent Safeguarding Board did not involve any proposals for future safeguarding models for the Church of England and we have amended our story to make that clear."

On a visit to HMP Styal, in Wilmslow, Catherine was shown a project designed to develop strong and healthy relationships between mothers and babies ""even in the most challenging of environments"". The princess, in contrast to more glamorous royal engagements, stepped through the security gates in the rain, ahead of a tour of the prison, which holds about 400 inmates, some serving life sentences. While there, she met specialist staff supporting new mothers, and visited a nursery for babies who will have to spend their first formative months inside a jail. On her fourth official visit to a prison, the princess met women being supported by the Action for Children charity, which runs mother and baby units in three prisons in the north of England. ""Being a mum in prison is difficult,"" a former inmate told her. But she said that the specialist help provided a ""safe space"" and gave her a chance of training and help with learning about parenthood. ""I've made silly decisions and ended up in this position, but you can't turn back the clock. But I've got as much out of it as I could,"" she said, telling the princess that she had embraced what she could learn while in prison. The former inmates also talked about the stigma attached to having a baby in prison - and the princess talked to staff about the importance of ""attachment and bonding"", including for mothers who had faced trauma in their own lives. But there were also shouts and whistles as the royal visitor moved around the prison, with calls from inmates: ""We need more funding. Tell them the truth."" Last year, there were warnings about safety from women who had been inmates at the prison - and there had been an increase in the mental health support budget for the jail. The prison hopes that helping new mothers build a strong connection with their newborns while in jail will reduce the risk of reoffending when inmates are released. The princess has a strong interest in early years education, as set out in her Shaping Us initiative, which emphasises the importance of the first five years of a child's life. Tuesday's visit to HMP Styal continues this campaign to raise awareness of those early years. It is the latest in a series of engagements this year, as the princess returns to work after the end of her cancer treatment The unit at HMP Styal provides a separate area for new and expectant mothers. Stuffed toys were dotted around the unit, that tries to create a different atmosphere to regular prison life. There is nursing care and support for both the mothers and their babies - who may spend their first 18 months in prison. Figures from the Ministry of Justice estimate that there are about 200,000 children in England and Wales with a parent, either a mother or father, in prison. There has often been attention on what the princess is wearing on such visits, with interest in her fashion choices - and it has been clarified by Kensington Palace aides on Tuesday that there is no change in the policy of sharing details of her clothing. The palace will sometimes issue details of what the princess is wearing, but not necessarily always, with ""no change in our approach"", says a palace spokesperson.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3e1q973dwdo,Fans bid farewell to Denis Law at United star's funeral,2025-02-11T16:11:35.667Z,,"Family, fans and footballers from across the generations have bade a final farewell to Manchester United and Scotland legend Denis Law. About 750 mourners paid their respects to one of the game's all-time greats at his funeral earlier. More than 1,000 fans gathered at Old Trafford to applaud as the cortege passed the stadium, pausing at the Trinity statue which depicts him alongside Sir Bobby Charlton and George Best, and then travelling on to Manchester Cathedral. The Red Devils icon and only Scotsman to ever be named the world's best player died last month aged 84. Footballers past and present turned up to pay their respects to Law as well as Manchester United's Sir Alex Ferguson who described Law as ""my hero"" and current manager Ruben Amorim. Among the myriad of United legends who paid their respects, some of Manchester City's greats joined the mourners where Law also played. These included Law's former teammates Joe Corrigan and Mike Summerbee. The funeral procession arrived at Manchester Cathedral to the sound of bagpipes playing Flower of Scotland. Diana Law paid tribute to her late father, who she said has now reunited with club greats Charlton and Best. She said: ""There is an Englishman, Irishman and Scotsman. I think of them all up there in heaven. Reunited smiling down. Maybe they have started a team already with Sir Matt as the manager."" Sir Alex also paid tribute to his fellow Scotsman at the service. ""Trying to place Denis in the pantheon of all time greats is a challenge. But it is made easier by Pele. ""He was asked if there was a British player who could get in the [great] Brazil team. He said Denis Law - which is a fantastic tribute."" Sir Alex then talked about Law's love for Scotland and how ""he loved beating England"". ""He once lined up before a game against England. ""He loved Nobby Stiles and Nobby worshipped him. Nobby came bounding down the tunnel and wished Denis all the best. ""Denis gave him a withering look and let off a volley of abuse Nobby never forgot."" Sir Alex went on to say he often wondered why supporters called him The King, and came to the conclusion ""it was to do with his profile"". ""He would fight his granny for a goal,"" he said. ""He had so much courage. A skinny guy standing among all those big defenders."" Leading the service, Cannon Grace Thomas told mourners Law's death marked ""the end of an era, the last of the famous Trinity to go"". ""But what a wonderful legacy he leaves behind for supporters. And also in the hearts, minds and memories of all who loved him,"" she said. Rod Stewart's rendition of Angel was played as the service ended. Law who was born in Aberdeen in 1940 was capped 55 times for Scotland. He remains the country's joint-top scorer of all time with 30 goals. Law started out at Huddersfield Town at the age of 15 before going to United's great rivals, Manchester City. He left City for Italy's Torino after a year but moved back to Manchester to join United in 1962. It was the third transfer involving Law to set a new British record fee. Law spent 11 years at Old Trafford, where his 237 goals in 404 appearances have kept him in third place on United's all-time goal scorers list, behind Wayne Rooney and his former teammate Charlton. His time at the club saw it win two league titles, the FA Cup the European Cup as the first English team to do so.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg48jgdppgo,"Church risks further crisis if it doesn't act, says ex-child abuse inquiry chair",2025-02-11T12:23:31.886Z,Aleem Maqbool,"The Church of England risks further crisis if it fails to adopt a sweeping new independent system to keep people safe, the former head of a national inquiry into child sexual abuse has said. The Church's national assembly will vote later on Tuesday on options to radically change its safeguarding processes. One of the systems being considered is based on a model proposed by Prof Alexis Jay, who was asked by the Church for her input. But some members of the Church have cast doubts about the system that comprehensively hands the process for dealing with abuse allegations to an outside organisation. The resignation of the former Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby over his handling of a prolific abuser and questions about Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell's handling of another case have added a sense of urgency to make changes. At the Church's General Synod, two models are being put to the vote on Tuesday, both involving some measure of independence. The first involves creating an independent central safeguarding team for the Church - but with diocesan and cathedral safeguarding officers continuing in the same roles. The second would also make the Church's safeguarding officers around the country part of that independent body. Both options would see safeguarding work scrutinised by a second external body, but a 66-page document published last month said it would take ""a minimum of two years to legislate for a scrutiny body as a statutory body"". After years of the Church of England being accused of failing to ""mark its own homework"", Prof Jay, a respected figure in child protection, feels only the second model goes far enough. ""I think it's absolutely necessary because church safeguarding as it stands falls below the standards of secular organisations, and I do not think that can continue when it has also led to such serious weaknesses,"" she told the BBC. In October 2022, Prof Jay finished a seven-year inquiry into the countless ways children had been sexually abused in England and Wales with her team investigating abuse in churches, schools, custodial institutions, political parties, religious groups, and children's homes. In summer 2023, Prof Jay was asked by Archbishop Justin Welby to advise on how the Church could ""outsource"" safeguarding. She said she was not asked to investigate whether the Church needed safeguarding that was independent of the Church. ""I'm glad the General Synod is going to be debating a model that largely reflects what I was asked to do in the report I published last year, a model of full independence,"" she said. Prof Jay said there would be dire consequences if Synod members did not vote for the more complete model of independence. ""I think that not adopting that version would mean it would be a matter of time before yet more safeguarding crises occurred, and there would be a renewed calls for radical action to be taken,"" she said. Some within the Church have raised concerns about Prof Jay's preferred option because they fear it is too radical a model and not a well-tested one. ""Whether or not there are precedents is absolutely not the point,"" she said. ""There is also the option for the Church to commission an existing charity with a track record in care and support for children and vulnerable adults to ask them to carry out this work."" Prof Jay also dismissed suggestions that making the system independent would mean that some within the Church would no longer feel safeguarding was their responsibility too. But she said choosing the correct system to deal with abuse allegations would only resolve part of the problem, saying cultural issues - like deference to authority figures in the Church - were also hampering progress. Some within the Church have questioned Prof Jay's understanding of the way in which the institution works but she said it was criticism she expected. ""I was asked to do a piece of work. I did it. I knew quite well that it would be problematic for some, but the Church must face up to its responsibilities and do what they need to do,"" she said. If it is voted through, the fully independent model should then be delivered by a team committed to its success, she added. It is estimated that could yet take around three years. Dame Jasvinder Sanghera was a survivor advocate on the Church of England's independent safeguarding board until the panel was sacked in June 2023 when the church said relations between board members and bishops had ""broken down"". ""The church can no longer be trusted to manage safeguarding. The current system fails to prevent abuse and cover up,"" she told Radio 4's Today programme. She said the Church needed ""independent oversight that stands up to scrutiny, not a design designed by the Church of England where they have their hand over it - it has to be a regulatory body that is independent from the church"". Asked on the programme if she believed that there are many other bishops and archbishops that if they had to submit to this sort of scrutiny would find themselves having to stand aside from their positions, she said: ""Yes I do, actually, I do."" ""From what I'm hearing in relation to how bishops are given different treatment, to what I'm hearing from survivors in relation to complaints that they have put forward, there are individuals who remain within that organisation that really should be stepping aside,"" she said. A spokesperson for the Church of England said the Church is ""committed to making safeguarding as robust and independent as possible"" and the Synod will decide between two proposed models that significantly strengthen the independence of safeguarding structures while ensuring effective oversight and scrutiny"". ""Both models involve the creation of a new external body to scrutinise safeguarding work, and both take into account the recommendations of independent reviews, including those by Prof Alexis Jay and Sarah Wilkinson. ""The proposals have been developed through extensive consultation, including with victims and survivors, and represent a significant step forward in strengthening safeguarding across the Church. ""We recognise the deep and lasting impact of abuse and are committed to ensuring that safeguarding in the Church is independent, transparent, and accountable. ""It is right that Synod now considers these proposals and determines the best way forward."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rq2g0kz1lo,'Billionaires own my mouldy rental property',2025-02-11T11:51:47.930Z,Rahil Sheikh,"""I fear for his health because I know once it comes back, his health starts to deteriorate all over again,"" says Sinead as she shows us the mould staining the walls of the flat she shares with her son. When she and five-year-old Aziyah moved into their home in Brighton in 2020, it seemed in good condition. But black mould quickly began to appear. Over the next two years it spread all over the walls, even onto the beds and furniture. The 25-year-old, who privately rents for £1,100 a month, initially reported it to her landlord, but despite their attempt to improve ventilation, the problem remained. A year later, Aziyah began to develop health issues and was later diagnosed with asthma. Five years since it all started, despite repeated complaints to her landlord and her local council, Sinead's mould problem has not been solved and she feels trapped. ""No matter how loud I scream, I'm not being heard,"" she says. More than half a million rented homes - both private and social - have black mould issues in England, a 2023 government survey found. In Rotherham, we met an elderly couple who have lived in the same privately rented house for more than 50 years. It has peeling wallpaper, wet walls, large black mould patches and an overwhelming smell of damp. When asked what effect it is having, 82-year-old Christine Brown told us: ""Do you want the truth? I just wish I were dead. That's how it's got me."" Christine, and husband Paul, 74, have a protected tenancy which keeps the rent low, at £440 per month. They did not know who their landlord was. All communication was through a letting agent. After some digging, Panorama discovered the house is owned by a large property company, run by a billionaire family. Christine suffers from asthma, angina and bronchitis and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), a progressive lung condition she believes was caused by the mould. Mould exposure can badly affect people with COPD or asthma as it can trigger an irritant response. ""Your airways close up, you start coughing,"" says the chair of the Royal College of GPs, Kamila Hawthorne. ""There's more chance of you picking up an infection and you're more likely then to need antibiotics and/or steroids - and possibly even a hospital admission."" More than 26,000 babies and toddlers were admitted to hospital last year with lung conditions probably linked to exposure to damp and mould, Panorama analysis of NHS England data has found. After two-year-old Awaab Ishak's death in 2020 was found to have been directly linked to mould exposure, the then-Conservative government drew up a new law in his name to protect social tenants in England from unsafe living conditions. But the legislation is yet to come into effect. The government announced the law will be enforced for damp and mould problems from October - and fully implemented for all other hazards by 2027. Private renters will be protected in the same way - says the government - once its Renters' Rights Bill becomes law, expected later this year. In Awaab's case, his father Faisal had repeatedly raised the mould problem with the housing association responsible for the family's Rochdale flat, but no action was taken. Faisal is frustrated the change has taken so long. ""They should bring it through as soon as possible,"" he says. ""It's going to be saving a lot of people's lives."" In Brighton, as Aziyah's health worsened, Sinead says she was ""really scared"" and ""feared for his life"". ""He was coughing and vomiting,"" she says, which medical records show had led to dangerously low blood sugar. At another point, he had a persistent cough for eight months. ""He said, 'Mummy, how do you stop this coughing?' And I said, 'You can't, Aziyah,'"" says Sinead. After she complained to the council - which is responsible for ensuring landlords maintain housing standards - the landlord installed extractor fans and provided dehumidifiers. But the mould remained. In many cases, local authorities are not enforcing private landlords' legal duty to maintain safe housing. We asked every local authority in England and Wales for the number of complaints they had received about housing issues and what enforcement action they had taken. In the past seven years, there were more than 570,000 complaints (from 255 council responses, after 317 requests) about privately rented homes. In more than 90% of cases, no action was taken and fewer than 1% of complaints resulted in a landlord being prosecuted. Councils are facing significant ongoing and historic challenges with resourcing, says the Local Government Association that speaks for authorities in England and Wales. ""Issues may be resolved without the need for inspection, with enforcement and prosecution being a last resort when all other options fail,"" it adds. Over the past 10 years, council funding in England has gone down by 10% in real terms, according to the National Audit Office. ""There is a perfect storm now happening, some of which is around really stretched funding, some of which is around the age of homes,"" England's Housing Ombudsman Richard Blakeway says. In England alone, more than three million households are estimated to be living in properties that do not meet the government's decent homes standard, according to a government survey. The homes are either in a state of disrepair, do not have modern kitchen and bathroom facilities, or lack adequate heating and insulation. When Christine shows us around her privately-rented home in Maltby, Rotherham, there are visible issues with damp in every room. ""I'm sick of seeing it like this. My house has never been like this. When I was younger and working I could do it [repair the house] myself,"" she says. ""We just can't do it now."" The couple say they first told their managing agent, Savills, about the problems in 2022. Savills says it authorised work for the house, including having the roof resurfaced in 2023 - but water is still getting in, including from the adjoining property, and many other problems remain. BBC Panorama wanted to find out who was ultimately responsible for the condition of the home. It is owned by a company called Area Estates Ltd, which Companies House records show is part of the William Pears Group. Two of the three brothers who are directors of the group live in some of the most expensive postcodes in London. One of them, Mark Pears, is also on the 2024 Sunday Times rich list, with an estimated family wealth of more than £3bn. He is also a trustee of the British Museum. His brother and fellow director Sir Trevor Pears was knighted in 2017 for his charity work. Area Estates told us it had authorised professional managing agents ""to look after the [Rotherham] property in accordance with all regulations"", and to ""carry out day-to-day maintenance"", and that requests for more expensive repairs were always responded to quickly. ""The managing agents will reinspect the house shortly and attend to any repair issues found which are the landlord's responsibility,"" it added. Managing agent Savills said it was ""very sorry to learn that Mrs Brown believes that complaints have been in any way ignored"". It said it had always attempted to address any problems in a timely manner - and had completed 13 different inspection and repair works at the property between 2023 and 2024. When BBC Panorama told the couple about the identity of their landlord, Christine said: ""I'd shake his hand and I'd say, 'please make my house safe'."" Since Area Estates was contacted, Savills has arranged for new windows to be fitted and the house to be redecorated. The agent says all remedial works have now been completed with the ""exception of an outstanding matter regarding a 'lean to' building, erected by the tenant, to which further works may be required to make it water tight"". In Sinead's case, while council environmental health officers said there were problems, they concluded the flat was safe. She then secured legal aid to pay for an independent inspection. It said the flat was ""unfit for human habitation"". Sinead also applied for social housing, submitting evidence about Aziyah's health. But the council said he had not had ""frequent A&E visits with hospital admissions and complex treatment"". Brighton and Hove City Council says the issues it has the legal power to enforce at Sinead's flat have now been addressed by the private landlord. It says it has also recommended improvements to ""ventilation and insulation"" that it ""can encourage but cannot enforce"". Sinead's landlord accepts that ""there is a problem with condensation"" but says the continuing issues are ""due to neglect"" by her not clearing away condensation. Keeping a consistent temperature and ventilation can help prevent mould growth - but it will not solve the problem if faults with the building mean there is poor ventilation or damp is coming in. Meanwhile, despite the flat having been cleaned and repainted last summer, the mould is coming back. Aziyah's cough still hasn't cleared up and he has been referred to a lung specialist. ""It's my son that keeps me going,"" says Sinead. ""If I don't fight this, then who will fight for him?"" Update: This article has been updated to make clear that more than three million households are estimated to be living in properties that do not meet the government's decent homes standard. It originally said three million social tenants. Update Tuesday 11 February: This article now includes additional comment from managing agent Savills regarding the latest remedial work on Christine and Paul's home."

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93l4k2kywzo,"I know I have made mistakes, says under-fire archbishop",2025-02-10T18:51:39.911Z,Ian Aikman Aleem Maqbool,"Archbishop of York Stephen Cottrell said he had made mistakes and that ""trust has been broken"" as he opened a meeting of the Church of England's governing body, the General Synod. Mr Cottrell, who has stepped in as head of the Church, was speaking after the Bishop of Newcastle, Helen Ann-Hartley, said he was the ""wrong person"" to bring much-needed reform. Bishop Hartley has called for Mr Cottrell's resignation, after he faced criticism for his handling of a sexual abuse case last year. The Church is searching to replace Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, who stood down last year amid criticism of his and the Church's handling of the prolific child abuser John Smyth. Mr Cottrell came under fire in December after a BBC investigation revealed he had allowed a priest to remain in post despite knowing he was barred from being alone with children and had paid compensation to a sexual abuse victim. In an opening address, Mr Cottrell said the Church of England is facing ""difficult and challenging times"" and acknowledged the ""anguish, anger, sadness and regret"" that victims and survivors of abuse feel about recent safeguarding failings. Before he spoke, a vote which would have stopped Mr Cottrell from giving the opening address at the synod failed. The vote, proposed by a lay member of the General Synod, argued Mr Cottrell's position was ""no longer tenable"". Some 73 synod members voted in favour, 239 against and 43 abstained, allowing the address to go ahead. Sam Margrave, from the Diocese of Coventry, tabled the motion. He told the BBC that people ""up and down the country... [have] lost confidence in their archbishops, and it's time for action, not time for silence"". Mr Margrave said he originally put forward a motion calling for Mr Cottrell to resign but was told he ""wasn't allowed to"". He continued: ""I think that decision was wrong and I think General Synod should have a vote whether we have confidence, but this was one way to express our dissatisfaction. ""There were large numbers of people who have spoken and said 'we don't have confidence in the archbishop, and it really is time for him to go'."" That dramatic start to General Synod only added to the sense that this was something of a crisis meeting. Over recent months the Church of England has been left shell-shocked by Justin Welby's resignation and the subsequent scandals that have been swirling around leaders of the institution. The subdued nature of the gathering on Monday reflected the cloud under which it takes place.   However, others expressed resentment over the calls for Mr Cottrell to resign and what some have described as ""trial by media"". Speaking to the BBC, Bishop of Dover Rose Hudson-Wilkin said: ""This sort of febrile attitude... this is not about a boardroom meeting… this is the church, we are about the business of God."" She said the gathering should be viewed as ""an opportunity for the church to stop and take stock, as it were"". During his address at the synod, Mr Cottrell said: ""I know mistakes have been made and I know that I have made mistakes."" He added that he is ""determined to do what I can"" to ""lead the change we all know we need"". The synod is expected to hold significant discussions about safeguarding measures this week, after the Church faced criticism for its handling of child abuse spanning decades in a scathing report last year. Bishop Hartley was the first senior member of the clergy to call for Mr Welby's resignation after the report into the Smyth case was published. She said she is now viewed as a troublemaker by some of her colleagues in the clergy, with one branding her as the ""Bishop of Negativity"". ""I think that's really sad,"" she said, adding that she believed others may have joined her in speaking out if ""fear"" had not stopped them. Also known as the Church's parliament, the General Synod meets up to three times a year to debate and pass measures governing how the Church works. It is made up of 478 members who are elected every five years. Victims and survivors of abuse, along with several members of the clergy, have called for safeguarding reform, and the subject has been placed on this week's synod agenda. Bishop Hartley said Mr Cottrell was not the right man to oversee the reform process. ""I do not think that it's appropriate for the Archbishop of York to be in post, and certainly to be leading change that the Church needs at this time,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. Criticism of Mr Cottrell grew after the BBC revealed last year that he had allowed priest David Tudor to remain in post despite a ban on contact with children and past compensation pay outs. ""To allow Tudor to remain in post, I do find abhorrent,"" Bishop Hartley said. She also criticised Mr Cottrell reportedly praising Tudor as a ""Rolls Royce priest"" despite knowing about the settlement. Since the BBC investigation was first published, Mr Cottrell has said he is ""deeply sorry"" that action could not be taken earlier, but that was the situation he inherited. Tudor was banned from ministry last year. A 2024 report by child safety expert Professor Alexis Jay found that the Church of England's safeguarding measures fell below the standards expected of secular organisations. A spokesperson for the Church of England said the synod will decide between ""two proposed models that significantly strengthen the independence of safeguarding structures"" this week. ""We recognise the deep and lasting impact of abuse and are committed to ensuring that safeguarding in the Church is independent, transparent, and accountable,"" they added."

The vessel is currently used on crossings between the Channel Islands and the south coast of England. Jersey's government has chosen the Danish firm DFDS to run its future ferry services, meaning Condor will only serve Guernsey from April. Condor's timetable, from April onwards, does not include the Liberation. Ship broker the GRS Group said the information it held showed that the current owners were open to selling the Liberation. The firm is advertising a ship, in the Condor pink and yellow livery, for sale on its website. The Liberation was built in 2010 by an Australian-based firm and has been used by Condor since 2015. The ship's name was chosen from thousands of suggestions from the public, in the same year the islands celebrated the 70th anniversary of liberation from occupation during World War Two.

Domas Paskauskas, 38, of Peterborough, and Donatas Sukys, 41, from Spalding, were stopped by border officers at Cairnryan bound for Northern Ireland in October 2022. The lorry they were travelling in was pulled over and officials noticed a strong smell of aftershave in the cab and a search was carried out. The pair admitted being concerned in the supply of both cannabis and cocaine at the High Court in Edinburgh and their sentence was deferred. The court heard that nothing untoward was found in their trailer, but 16 packages were recovered from the cab with the smell of herbal cannabis coming from many of them. Officers suspected some of the packages might contain Class A drugs and more than three kilogrammes of high purity cocaine was found after a Paul Smith designer bag in the cab was checked. Judge Paul Brown was told that the cocaine was 78% pure and had the potential to be worth in excess of £300,000 in street deals. More than 25kg of the Class B drug cannabis was also recovered which had a potential maximum street value of more than £250,000. Paskauskas, of Peterborough in Cambridgeshire, and Donatas Sukys, from Spalding in Lincolnshire, admitted being concerned in the supply of both cannabis and cocaine at the port on 2 October 2022. Both men had Lithuanian interpreters present in court with them to help them follow the legal proceedings. The court heard that Paskauskas, a lorry driver and sole director of a company, was approached by ""a third party"" who asked him to transport a consignment of goods to Northern Ireland. He claimed he was told that cannabis was involved, but not cocaine. Paskauskas was disqualified from driving at the time and approached Sukys to drive the load and told him the consignment contained cannabis. Defence counsel Frances Connor, for Paskauskas, said neither of the accused had served a prison sentence previously. The judge adjourned sentence for the preparation of background reports on the pair and they were remanded in custody."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3wrkeng2eo,MoD investigates air crew cancers after helicopter claims,2025-02-10T16:08:02.279Z,Jack Fenwick,"The government is investigating how many military personnel have been diagnosed with cancer, after claims that some helicopters left crew exposed to toxic fumes. At least six cases have already been settled out of court by the Ministry of Defence (MoD), with dozens of other air crew and families understood to be in the process of suing. They claim that officials knew about safety concerns with certain aircraft as far back as 1999, but chose not to tell the crew or introduce sufficient safety precautions. The MoD says it takes ""the health of our personnel extremely seriously"" and is currently testing the exhaust emissions of some military helicopters. Diseases contracted by some of the crew who flew the helicopters include lung cancer, throat cancer, testicular cancer and some rare forms of blood cancer. The Times reported last year that at least three former air crew have died and others have been told their cancer is terminal. It's understood the government accepts that the design of some rotary wing aircraft increases the likelihood of engine exhaust fumes entering the cabin. Benzene, which is a known human carcinogen, is an element present in aircraft fuel. In November, the government began testing helicopter exhaust fumes, but it's understood that officials still believe there is no risk to health. The MoD has confirmed it is now carrying out work to determine the number of armed forces personnel who have served as air crew and been diagnosed with cancer. It's understood that this work officially began earlier this year; covers the RAF, the Army and the Navy, and will include veterans as well as active personnel. When approached by BBC News, the MoD was unable to say when it hopes to come up with an initial estimate of the number of people potentially affected. But one Westminster source familiar with the work said that complexities around accessing veterans' health records mean it is likely to take years. More than 150 people are thought to have approached law firms claiming to have been affected, but many will not be eligible for compensation, as the law allowing claims against the MoD only came into effect in 1987. At least four types of aircraft have been named in legal documents, including the Sea King, Westland Wessex, Puma and CH-47 Chinook. The law firm Hugh James, which is representing many of the families affected, claims that risks surrounding the Sea King were made clear to the MoD in 1999. They said a report ""recommended modifications to the aircraft to divert the exhaust fumes"" but claimed the MoD ""failed to act on these recommendations"" and ""failed to make servicemen aware of the potential dangers and the risk of cancers developing"". The Sea King was used in British military operations between 1969 and 2018 and has in the past been flown by both King Charles and the Prince of Wales. The Westland Wessex was retired in 2003, while the Puma and CH-47 Chinook are still in use. The MoD pointed to previous helicopter tests carried out on behalf of the RAF that didn't show any indication air crew were being exposed to dangerous levels of contaminants. Louisa Donaghy, a senior associate at Hugh James, said the firm was representing more than 40 former military personnel but warned there could be more. ""It's encouraging that the MoD has begun work to understand the scale of this issue, but the process must be swift and transparent,"" she said. ""Every delay means more veterans and service personnel could be left without the support they need. Given the challenges in accessing veterans' records, it's vital that the government commits the necessary resources to ensure no one is overlooked."" Last month BBC News used a Freedom of Information request to ask the MoD how many current and former air crew they are aware of who've been diagnosed with cancer. They said they didn't hold the data centrally, but confirmed in their response that the work to establish the number of people affected was under way. A spokesperson for the MoD said they ""take the health of our personnel extremely seriously and regularly review our processes to ensure that we're doing what we can to keep our people safe"". They added that it was ""essential that we can assure our people of their safety at work""."

Both committed to making all Holocaust records public in 2022 and said many of the records have since been digitised and made available online, with work ongoing to complete the digitisation. Jersey Heritage said many records were available, including files from German troop courts as well as naturalisation and immigration files covering ""people of Jewish faith"". A spokesperson for Guernsey's Island Archives said a ""significant amount of work"" had been done to preserve records from the bailiwick's occupation. The UK Government also committed to making all Holocaust records public in 2022. Jersey Heritage said it had identified one record relating to Jewish people in the naturalisation files - about a former Austrian citizen and his wife, staying in London, who had applied to come to Jersey. Letters from the file showed the couple's application was refused and they applied to the Home Office for a travel document to move to America. Jersey Heritage said its immigration files also showed details of five Jewish people who applied to come to the islands in the 1930s, adding the records showed ""the States of Jersey policy towards Jewish immigration at the time"". It said there were ""still some records closed from the occupation period but these were documents subject to standard closure periods and were not unique to the occupation"", such as education and hospital records. A spokesperson for the States of Guernsey said staff at the Island Archives were about halfway through the current batch of digitisation, but expected it to be several years before all records had been digitised. Island Archives said ""some of the most popular records"" had been digitised and were available online, while others were available to view in person. It said overseas people doing research could also contact the Island Archives to put them in touch with a local researcher. Follow BBC Guernsey on X and Facebook. Follow BBC Jersey on X and Facebook.

Friday's dinner, with guests including David and Victoria Beckham, Dame Helen Mirren and Donatella Versace, was a culinary warm-up for the royal couple's state visit to Italy and the Vatican in early April, where they will meet Pope Francis. The trip is expected to coincide with Charles and Camilla's 20th wedding anniversary and the King told dinner guests about his love of Italian food and culture. ""Good food brings people together and what we choose to eat helps to define us - as families, communities and nations,"" said the King. The UK-Italy dinner, hosted by the King and Queen at their Highgrove estate in Gloucestershire, and with the Italian ambassador to the UK, Inigo Lambertini, was a celebration of ""slow food"", which uses fresh local food and traditional cooking methods. Other guests included former British Vogue editor-in-chief Edward Enninful and chefs Raymond Blanc and Angela Hartnett. The King hailed this ""most splendid evening which brings together two things very dear to my heart - slow food and Italy"". ""A nation's food culture is a priceless social and environmental asset, intimately bound up with its sense of identity and place,"" said the King. An enthusiast for art, culture and religion, he spoke of his enthusiasm for the state visit, which will be his 18th official visit to the country. ""To say that we are looking forward to it would be to engage in a little British understatement,"" he joked to diners, including Stanley Tucci, who inspired the choice of food. The reception and dinner menu, cooked by Calabrian chef Francesco Mazzei, featured Italian recipes with British ingredients. It was accompanied by English sparkling wine and Italian red and white wines. Reception: Rare and pasture salumi Tuscan-style paté and coppa Yorkshire pecorino cheese puffs British vegetables caponata tartelletta with Highgrove sparkling wine  Dinner: Scottish crab panzanella Westcombe ricotta and Highgrove fine herbs ravioli Isle of Wight tomato passata Suffolk Red porchetta Pumpkin and sage mash, Tuscan kale with white wine Gavi dei Gavi La Scolca Black label 2023 and red wine Barbaresco Gaja 2021 Zuppa Inglese and biscotti with a red dessert wine, Recioto della Valpolicella Classico Zenato Some of the British guests in attendance had strong links to Italy. Dame Helen and her husband have a house in Puglia, in the south of the country, where they spend six months out of the year. She previously told a local TV show that she is learning to speak Italian, and has found ""nothing but kindness"" in the area where she lives. And it is sometimes forgotten that David Beckham played 29 matches for AC Milan in two loans spells in 2009 and 2010 as he sought to prove his match fitness to play for England in the 2010 World Cup. But it was a bittersweet experience as the second spell was cut short by an Achilles tendon injury that ultimately ruled him out of the World Cup in South Africa. King Charles said of the combined culinary efforts of chef Mazzei and Tucci: ""I can only hope they are still talking to each other at the end of it all!"" Cocktails were made by ""mixologist"" Alessandro Palazzi, using herbs from the gardens at Highgrove. There was a toast made by the King in Italian, ""alla eterna cultura italiana del buon cibo,"" meaning ""to Italy's timeless food culture"". This dinner comes ahead of the state visit in early April, confirmed on Thursday by Buckingham Palace. There will be engagements in Rome and Ravenna, with the King and Queen set to hold meetings with Pope Francis and Italian political leaders.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rq2d9qjzlo,Andrew aide asks court to withhold testimony on alleged spy,2025-02-07T19:14:54.219Z,Dominic Casciani,"A top aide to Prince Andrew is urging a court to withhold his account of the prince's relationship with an alleged Chinese spy because he did not realise it could become public. Dominic Hampshire played a key role in the development of Yang Tengbo's relationship with the Duke of York - but the full details of what happened between the three men remain unclear. Last month a court rejected Mr Yang's appeal against being banned from the UK, after an intelligence assessment that he could be secretly working for the Chinese state. Mr Yang has denied all wrongdoing. Lawyers for the BBC and other media organisations argued at the Special Immigrations Appeal Commission (Siac) on Friday that Mr Hampshire could not keep his account private simply because he had lacked the ""common sense"" to find out if it might become public. In December, the court said Mr Yang had formed an ""unusual degree of trust"" with the prince and had not disclosed his links to an arm of the Chinese Communist Party clandestinely involved in political interference. It upheld the home secretary's conclusion that he was a threat to national security. The BBC and other news organisations are now asking Siac to release a witness statement that Mr Hampshire wrote in support of Mr Yang after the aide had been first contacted by British intelligence. In submissions on Friday, lawyers for Mr Hampshire said that he had sought assurances from Mr Yang's lawyers that the witness statement would remain private - and he had only realised it could become public when he arrived at the appeal hearing last July. Mr Hampshire then withdrew the statement in an attempt to prevent it from becoming public. ""I was told that the information [in the statement] would be kept private and confidential,"" Mr Hampshire said to the court in written submissions on Friday. ""If there was any question of this being available in the public domain, I was not warned of it. ""If I had been, I would never have agreed to submit a witness statement, much less go into the level of confidential detail which I did. ""I wrote what I did in the statement with such candour – including about my own confidential commercial interests but also about the private interests of third parties – in the expectation it was for the private attention of one of the most senior ministries of state on a grave matter. ""I quite simply would not have volunteered to write about those matters had I known that there was any chance, however small, that it was for use in a forum which was or could become public."" Adam Wolanski KC, representing the media organisations, said there was an exceptionally strong public interest case to release Mr Hampshire's account to journalists, along with other documents that remain confidential. ""It is extraordinary that a person in Mr Hampshire's position, apparently charged with dealing with confidential and sensitive matters on behalf of the Duke of York, did not bother obtaining his own legal advice before agreeing to provide a witness statement to Mr Yang,"" said Mr Wolanski in written submissions. ""Mr Hampshire cannot now pray in aid his mystifying and unexplained decision to give a witness statement in this obviously highly contentious matter without seeking his own legal advice. ""He should not be permitted to benefit from his, to put it kindly, lack of common sense and his bad decision to proceed without legal advice. ""The court must instead proceed on the basis that he made this decision with his eyes open, knowing the risk that the evidence may become public."" Mr Yang became a highly trusted confidante of Prince Andrew following the duke's interview with the BBC's Newsnight programme in November 2019, which detailed the Duke's friendship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. The fallout from the interview led to the prince withdrawing from public duties - and the end of his commercially successful Dragons Den-style investor events in the UK and China. In March 2020, Mr Hampshire told Mr Yang in a letter that he had managed to salvage the prince's reputation in China. Seven months later the businessman was authorised to represent the prince in China in a planned $3bn investment fund. The ""Eurasia Fund"" scheme aimed to raise cash to invest in Chinese state projects in Africa and the Middle East. Developing the regions is a cornerstone of the Chinese Communist Party's plan to expand its diplomatic and financial reach. The discovery of the scheme, and the fear that the prince was being drawn into a complex Beijing plan to influence him, led the home secretary to ban Mr Yang from the UK. He has denied all wrongdoing - saying he is a legitimate businessman who has worked for decades to improve links between China and the UK. Mr Yang came to study in the UK in 2002 and later set up a series of China-related travel and business consultancy firms. He met the Duke of York in 2014 and later took on a role in the China-based version of Prince Andrew's ""Pitch@Palace"" events, in which entrepreneurs sell their ideas to investors. Siac will rule later on whether further documents from the case will be made public."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy08dz47v8ro,'His hands were everywhere' - women accuse surviving Fayed brother of sexual assault,2025-02-07T17:35:49.893Z,Jo Adnitt and Kirstie Brewer,"Three former Harrods employees have accused Mohamed Al Fayed's only surviving brother of sexually assaulting them while they were working for the department store. Speaking publicly for the first time, the women say Ali Fayed, 82, assaulted them in the 1990s when he and his brothers, Mohamed and Salah, owned and ran Harrods. A spokesperson for Mr Fayed, who lives in the US, said the businessman ""will not be scapegoated"" and he ""unequivocally denies any and all the allegations of wrongdoing"" and that ""the incidents simply never took place"". Warning: This story contains descriptions of sexual violence The alleged sexual assaults happened in London, Scotland, Switzerland and the United States. One of the women, a former interior designer for Harrods, says one assault happened on a work trip while she was staying with Ali Fayed and his family at their former home in Connecticut. ""His hands were everywhere,"" she says, and he stopped because ""one of his little boys started calling for him"". All three women say prior to Ali Fayed's alleged assaults, they had also been sexually abused by his older brother. Police say 111 women have now made allegations against Mohamed Al Fayed, who added the Arabic ""Al"" prefix to his surname sometime in the 1970s. One of the women, Amy, has told the BBC she wants ""an explanation"" from Ali Fayed, and an ""understanding of what was going on that can help [her] step forward and begin healing"". All three say they didn't feel able to speak out at the time. ""This is my chance to finally stand up for myself. I'm not going to be that scared 24-year-old who doesn't know what to do,"" says Frances - who, like Amy, has waived her right to anonymity. Frances took a job working for Harrods in the store's interior design studio in 1989. It wasn't long before Mohamed Al Fayed began to bully and sexually abuse her, she says. Frances says she recalls him regularly trying to grab her breasts and grope her while at work, or subjecting her to ""foul"" verbal tirades. Despite not having much experience, Frances says she was tasked with renovating Mohamed Al Fayed's sprawling Scottish Balnagown Estate, including a farmhouse belonging to his younger brother, Ali. Frances describes Ali Fayed's demeanour as calmer than that of Mohamed. ""I think for a moment I thought maybe he would be kinder to me,"" she says. ""But he wasn't."" Ali Fayed, like Mohamed, also had a private office and private apartment in 60 Park Lane in central London. It was in Ali's office where Frances says his sexual abuse started with him ""trying to kiss"" her, followed by him ""groping"" and ""molesting"" her. She says both the Fayed brothers would regularly give her gifts. ""With Mohamed, it would often be wads of cash, Ali would give jewellery or clothes. It would be a see-saw between abusive behaviour then praise for my work and these lavish items."" The abuse escalated in 1992, she says, when she flew to Connecticut to discuss interior design plans with Ali Fayed's wife. ""It was this huge private house and it was decorated in an English country house style. I don't think I'd ever seen anything like it in my life,"" says Frances. ""I remember his wife taking me into this picture-perfect American rich town."" Frances says she was staying in a guest room at the family's house when Ali Fayed told her to get changed for dinner one evening. ""I was in the bathroom and got undressed. When I came out in my underwear, he [Ali] was just standing there in the room. I hadn't heard him come in or knock."" Frances says Ali Fayed got her on the bed and tried to get on top of her. His hands were ""inside my bra, inside my pants. I knew what his intention was"". According to Frances the alleged attack stopped when one of Ali's children called out for him. Afterwards, she says she sat on the bed, ""frozen"". A spokesperson for Ali Fayed said the businessman ""is not a perpetrator"" and will ""robustly defend himself against these unsubstantiated claims"". When Frances returned to work in London, she says Mohamed Al Fayed ""exploded"" and started ""aggressively spitting abusive words"" because he apparently believed she and Ali had had sex . She says he told her: ""I'm done with you… go be with my brother."" ""From that point, I'd still see Mohamed, and he'd still call me every name under the sun, but he didn't actually physically abuse me,"" says Frances. ""Now I was in fear of two of the owners and I knew if I spoke out it would get worse. I could be threatened, I could be fired. I just felt I had to keep on going and, at some point, this horror would pass."" Frances says Ali Fayed sexually assaulted her again later that year on a trip to Balnagown, where she was adding the finishing interior touches to his farmhouse. Ali called her into his private office, she says, then dragged her onto his lap and started kissing her neck and touching her breasts as he spun around in his chair. She says she could feel he was aroused through his trousers. ""I remember him laughing,"" recalls Frances, who says she eventually managed to break free and run out of the room. ""Laughter is meant to be nice. It wasn't. I left him there just laughing at me."" Ali Fayed would often try to sexually touch her when they met, she says, ""always laughing and joking and making out it was fun"". The following year, Frances says she was fired for being in a relationship with another employee, something she says Mohamed Al Fayed forbade among staff. Harrods later settled a case she brought for unfair dismissal. Frances describes her time after leaving Harrods as ""going underground and shutting myself down"". She struggled to work and trust people and eventually moved away. She says Mohamed and Ali Fayed ""took away"" her confidence and dignity. ""To this day I suffer with terrible anxiety and panic attacks and I don't like people in my space,"" she says. Mohamed Al Fayed and his younger brothers bought Harrods in 1985. While Mohamed was the chairman, running day-to-day operations of the luxury department store, Ali Fayed was a director and also helped oversee the House of Fraser group, which they owned in the early 1990s. The new claims point to the ""breadth of abuse"" by Mohamed Al Fayed and ""raise serious allegations"" against his brother Ali, Harrods told the BBC in a statement. ""We could not possibly speak on behalf of any individual who can, and should, respond to these allegations directly,"" it added. The store, which came under new ownership in 2010, said it hoped survivors were looking at ""every appropriate avenue to them in their pursuit of justice, whether that be Harrods, the police or the Fayed family and estate"". Ali Fayed, who was granted British citizenship in 1999, co-owns luxury British shirtmaker Turnbull and Asser with his sons - but resigned as director on 8 December 2024, 10 days after these allegations were put to him by the BBC. All three women alleging abuse by Ali Fayed initially spoke to filmmaker Keaton Stone, who has been investigating Mohamed Al Fayed since 2018 and whose work informed the BBC's recent documentary and podcast about Mohamed's predatory behaviour. Mohamed Al Fayed never faced charges while he was alive, but the women believe his brother Ali should now be investigated by police. ""Whether any charges would be brought, I don't know, but I believe he should be investigated for what he did,"" says Amy. She worked as a personal assistant to Mohamed Al Fayed for almost three years, and says he sexually abused her throughout her time at Harrods. The abuse escalated, Amy says, when Mohamed let himself into her room on a work trip to Paris and tried to rape her. She says she ""endured"" the abuse, thinking ""that was just what being a young woman meant, it was a hazard of the workplace"". Amy says she remembers Ali Fayed coming into Mohamed's Park Lane office - and also taking phone calls from him. ""He gave me the nickname 'Amy speaking' which he thought was hilarious,"" she recalls. ""He would giggle when he spoke to me."" A year or two into the job, Amy says Mohamed told her to go to Switzerland with Ali to help with some personal assistant duties like filing and paperwork. The pair travelled together on a Harrods private jet, she says, and were driven to the upmarket resort of Gstaad, where the Fayed family owned a ski chalet. ""Once we got to the chalet, aside from the elderly housekeeper, it was myself and Ali alone for three days. It was strange,"" says Amy. ""No efforts were made to even create something for me to do."" The trip was taken out of season and Amy says Ali Fayed seemed bored. He suggested they go to the local public swimming pool, she says, and when they got there it was deserted. ""That's when Ali's demeanour changed and he became giddy,"" says Amy. ""He pulled me in under the water, and groped and fondled me, making me feel very, very uncomfortable - very much trapped. I was terrified thinking how am I going to get out of this."" Amy says Ali Fayed laughed as he ""groped"" her, before she managed to break free of his clutches. After the alleged assault, Amy says they both returned to the chalet and she was left alone for the rest of the evening, feeling isolated and afraid. Like the other two women, Amy didn't tell anyone about the alleged abuse by either of the brothers. Amy says she didn't want to upset her loved ones and didn't necessarily feel people would believe her. ""By not saying anything, I think it's a coping technique, to just put it away,"" she adds. Amy went back to work after the alleged assault took place in Gstaad, but eventually resigned. She says she ""escaped and ran away"" to work abroad. ""I wanted to just remove myself from it all"", she says, but ""the trauma"" lived with her. ""To this day, in certain social situations, I don't want to be noticed, I try to stay invisible,"" she says. Ali Fayed denies all the allegations of wrongdoing - said his spokesperson - and ""will not allow false accusations to go unchallenged"". A third woman, who we are calling Laura, told us she recalls Mohamed Al Fayed summoning her to his office and telling her ""with a smirk on his face"" that his brother Ali wanted to see her. ""I remember it vividly because I had no comprehension of who Ali was, I'd never even seen him,"" she says. ""I don't know how I was spotted or 'selected' for him."" Laura had been working directly for Mohamed Al Fayed in Harrods' HR department and says his sexual harassment towards her had become commonplace, escalating to two serious sexual assaults. Laura says Mohamed sent her to their office building in Park Lane one evening, but when she arrived there was no work to be done. She says she was sent through to Ali Fayed's apartment where he was waiting. Laura says he told her they would be having dinner, and then presented her with a bottle of wine from the year she was born and a necklace. ""I wondered how he knew things about me,"" she says. Alone in his apartment, Laura says Ali Fayed ordered her through to the bedroom where she says she was subjected to a serious sexual assault. She says she felt ""numbed with fear"" and had to do whatever she was told in order to ""get out of there"". ""Afterwards he just told me I could go."" Laura says she never saw Ali Fayed again but kept the necklace from that night and it has recently been valued at £6,500. The abuse at Harrods ""took its toll"" says Laura - even after she left the store. She bottled it all up for 25 years, she says, and still hasn't told some of her loved ones what she went through. All three women are pursuing civil legal action against Harrods through Justice for Harrods Survivors. ""We applaud the bravery of the women who have spoken out on their allegations against Ali Fayed and reiterate our commitment to securing justice and accountability for all survivors,"" says their barrister Maria Mulla. ""We repeat, no stone will be left unturned in pursuit of this aim."" The BBC spoke to three other women who said they had been either raped, sexually assaulted or trafficked by the other Fayed brother, Salah, who died of pancreatic cancer in 2010. The women who accuse Ali Fayed question what the three brothers knew about each other's behaviour. ""Looking back now, maybe they found it amusing to see how far the boundaries were with us between the brothers,"" says Amy. ""Maybe there was competition. I really don't know, but I do feel it was all amusing for them."" Ali Fayed's spokesperson says he ""unequivocally denies any and all allegations of wrongdoing. The alleged incidents simply never occurred. Mr Fayed is not a perpetrator and will not be scapegoated. He will robustly defend himself against these unsubstantiated claims and will not allow false accusations to go unchallenged."" It is understood the Met Police has not recorded any allegations of sexual offending against Ali Fayed. A Met spokesperson told the BBC that the police force urged ""anyone with information, whether they were directly affected by Mohamed Al Fayed's actions or aware of others who may have been involved, or committed offences to come forward. ""We have specialist detectives who regularly handle sensitive cases and can provide survivors with access to support services. Every report will be carefully evaluated and recorded, and survivors are encouraged to use the secure channels provided to share their experiences."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14n2mk432po,Chris Hoy says raising cancer awareness gives him purpose,2025-02-07T11:31:37.523Z,Aleks Phillips,"Chris Hoy has said raising awareness about cancer since his diagnosis has given him a new purpose, after it led to his friend's prostate cancer being caught early. The six-time Olympic cycling champion, 48, disclosed last year that he had been diagnosed with prostate cancer, which had then become terminal with doctors giving him between two and four years to live. Speaking to BBC Breakfast on Friday, the former professional athlete said hearing of other men getting checked off the back of his announcement ""helps me make sense of my situation"". His latest project is a new cycling initiative, Tour de 4, aimed at challenging perceptions of people with cancer and raising money for cancer charities. Sir Chris said a friend in his mid-50s who had no symptoms and ""no previous issues at all"" would not have got a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test - which looks for signs of prostate cancer - if he had not made his own diagnosis public. ""Off the back of my diagnosis [he] went to his doctor, his doctor said 'you don't really need one' or 'there's no symptoms, come back when you've got any problems',"" he said. ""And he pushed the issue and he had a test and he has prostate cancer. He's being treated and he caught it early, so he's doing really well. But if it had been left for another few years, who knows what might have happened."" When the 11-time world track cycling champion announced his diagnosis following a routine scan, it brought messages of praise and support from other British athletes and public figures. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said at the time that ""the whole country is behind him and his family"". Prostate cancer is the most common type of cancer among men, with around one in eight in the UK being diagnosed with it in their lifetime. Sir Chris described the first few months after finding out as ""an emotional rollercoaster"", but said he had now ""got my head around it"". He added: ""When you find out a friend is in a similar situation, it's really difficult. But it has lifted me, it's given me a purpose."" BBC Breakfast also spoke to John Lee, who was diagnosed with prostate cancer a few weeks ago after having no symptoms. He said the Olympian's diagnosis may have saved his life. ""To have someone like that with that level of fitness and looking after themselves get prostate cancer, it suddenly occurred to me that I needed to get a test done,"" he said. Mr Lee added that his positive diagnosis had been ""devastating"", but that getting the test when he did meant it was ""caught in time"". Watching on, Sir Chris said: ""This is the kind of story - and there are quite a few of these that I've had via email or on social media - [that] makes sense of the situation. It's not in vain. It's not futile."" Sir Chris won six Olympic gold medals between 2004 and 2012 - the second highest total by any British Olympian - before retiring as an athlete in 2013. But he is still cycling - this time in preparation for the first Tour de 4 rally on 7 September for people affected by cancer, which will start and finish at the velodrome in Glasgow named after the Scot. ""I hope it's an uplifting event,"" he said. In the meantime, Sir Chris said he will be running several virtual bike rides with the likes of tennis star Andy Murray and other Olympic athletes that anyone can join, the first of which will take place on Saturday."

Mr Welby left the Church of England's most senior role in January after a damning report into a prolific child abuser associated with the Church. His replacement will be the 106th appointment to the role, the incumbent of which is the spiritual leader of the worldwide Anglican Church. Historically, candidates already hold senior leadership positions in ministry in the Church or elsewhere in the Anglican Communion. They must be aged at least 30 and are generally younger than 70. Names can be submitted to the Crown Nominations Commission (CNC), the body charged with nominating the new archbishop. The Church said the consultation, which runs until 28 March, was ""an opportunity to gather the views of a wide range of people from across England and the Anglican Communion on the gifts, qualities and skills needed"" for the role. There will be no advert to which anyone can put their name forward to, with possible candidates instead ""invited in"" to the process. People can submit their views on the Church of England website. The 20-member CNC panel that will select the next Archbishop of Canterbury has yet to be formalised. For the first time it will include five members based in the Anglican Church abroad. It will meet in May, July and September to ""pray, reflect and nominate a candidate"" and the chosen individual will require the votes of two-thirds of the 17 voting members. The name will then be given to the prime minster who will take it to the King for approval. Mr Welby resigned over the Church's handling of a sadistic abuser, John Smyth, who a report said had perpetrated brutal sexual, physical and mental abuse against more than 120 boys and young men since the late 1970s. The report said Mr Welby had ""personal and moral responsibility"" and that he ""could and should have done more"" in the case. After initially resisting calls to step down, he resigned on 12 November saying he was doing so ""in sorrow with all victims and survivors of abuse"". But in early December, abuse victims reacted with ""disgust"" at a short farewell speech Mr Welby gave at the House of Lords, in which he made jokes. Mr Welby apologised the following day. Before leaving the role he did not give a Christmas Day sermon at Canterbury Cathedral and did not broadcast a New Year's Day message, as he usually would through the BBC."

The ticket for the prize draw on 24 January worth £83,474,081.80 was purchased in the UK. The prize winner matched all five main numbers - 02, 11, 19, 30 and 49 - as well as the Lucky Star numbers, which were 03 and 08. Andy Carter, senior winners' adviser at National Lottery operator Allwyn, said it was ""absolutely incredible news"" that someone had come forward. Their claim needs to be verified before they receive a payout. ""Everyone dreams of that huge win when they buy their EuroMillions ticket - and for this lucky ticket-holder this dream has become a reality,"" he said, adding: ""Imagine all the possibilities that are now within their grasp."" Once the EuroMillions ticket has been validated and paid, the ticket-holder will then decide whether they wish to disclose their identity. Unless they decide to go public, there will be no information on where the ticket was purchased, nor whether they were an individual or syndicate winner, Allwyn said. The National Lottery said the jackpot was number 23 on their list of the ""most spectacular"" wins - ie the largest - of all time. In July 2022, an anonymous UK ticket-holder scooped the record EuroMillions jackpot of £195m. That same year, Joe and Jess Thwaite, from Gloucester, won a then record-breaking £184,262,899 with a Lucky Dip ticket for the draw on 10 May. The UK's third biggest win came after an anonymous ticket-holder claimed the £177m jackpot in the draw in November last year. According to the National Lottery, there are still nine EuroMillions prizes yet to be claimed by UK ticket-holders, with the largest standing at £1m. Ticket-holders have 180 days from the day of the draw to claim their prize."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3j8z08g17o,Plans to cut trains between Durham and Edinburgh,2025-02-06T12:18:04.748Z,Pamela Bilalova,"Durham could lose almost half of its direct train services to Edinburgh if timetable changes are approved. Currently, about 29 services travel on a weekday between the city and the Scottish capital, but that could drop to 17 if new timings go ahead. The changes also include the loss of a peak time LNER service, which is popular with commuters to Newcastle. In a joint statement, LNER and Network Rail said while timetable changes ""may not satisfy everyone"", they would benefit ""the greatest number of customers across the north"". Currently about 15 LNER services to Edinburgh call at Durham every day, approximately one every hour. Under the plans the majority of these would be removed, although the BBC understands three will still stop at the city at 06:33, 07:49 and 22:49. Peter Walker, from rail user group North East Coastliners, said the situation needed ""urgent attention and action"". ""Each hour's other service will call at Peterborough, Newark North Gate, Doncaster, York and Darlington but not Durham, whereas its equivalent in the current timetable does,"" Mr Walker said. ""As a result, Durham will, for most of the operating day, have no mainline LNER services to further north than Newcastle."" As part of the proposals, weekday services to London will increase from 19 to 22, and 21 trains will travel to Birmingham and Sheffield, up from 18. ""We recognise that timetable changes may not satisfy everyone, however the planned changes can be introduced reliably and will bring an additional six million seats on LNER services per year, provide faster services, and be of benefit to the greatest number of customers across the north,"" a spokesperson on behalf of LNER and Network Rail said. The timetables are due to be finalised in the summer, with changes made from December. Weekday services to Newcastle will remain about the same at 63, slightly down from 66 currently. However, some commuters have been concerned about the removal of a peak time LNER service to Edinburgh, which calls at Durham at 08:22 and arrives in Newcastle just after 08:30. It means there will be only two trains leaving the city for Newcastle between 08:00 and 09:00, with likely a total of seven carriages between them. Commuter Matthew Foskett has been breaking down the planned timetable changes and trying to raise awareness among passengers. Mr Foskett, who travels to his workplace in Newcastle by train at least two days a week, hopes some of the proposals could be reconsidered. He said under the new plans there would be a 47-minute gap between arrivals in Newcastle almost every hour, ""which would really affect people"". ""If the service gets worse, you'll lose passengers, and we all know how busy the roads are, you don't want more people driving into Newcastle,"" he said. ""Sometimes I cycle to Newcastle, that takes an hour and 15 minutes. If there's a 45-minute gap in the trains and it takes 15 minutes on the train, it gets quite close, time wise. ""I might as well cycle rather than getting the train, which is crazy."" A spokesperson on behalf of LNER and Network Rail said they had worked closely with other rail operators to ensure ""strong local and national connectivity"" in the planned timetable.

Will Blisset was 14 years old when he was involved in a serious accident in Andreas on the Isle of Man in 2018, leaving him with fractures to his face and head. The now 21-year-old was airlifted to Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool where he received treatment and support for four months. He said the staff at the hospital ""saved me"", so ""every step I take will be for the young people who still need their exceptional care"". Mr Blisset said it had been a ""very serious accident"" which had thrown his life ""into a tailspin"", leaving him having to learn to walk again. He said the care he received ""wasn't just the surgeries and treatment that I needed"" but also included support and ""encouragement to recover"". The Edge Hill student said although he was ""fully mobile again"" and had ""all cognitive function"", he still faced ""some challenges"" including his memory not being his ""strongest point anymore"". ""But I'm lucky to be to tell the story, so I'm OK living with some challenges,"" he said. The psychology student said he spotted a poster advertising the trek along the Great Wall of China to raise money for it's charity while on a placement at the hospital as part of his degree. The challenge will see the 21-year-old and other trekkers battle difficult terrain during the 21-mile (35km) walk over six days in September. Praising the support he received, he said the English language ""doesn't have enough words to praise the doctors and how good the care was"". He said the fundraiser was ""the chance of a lifetime"" to ""say thank you"" by aiming to raise £5000 for the hospital.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgx05gy0p5o,Time limit for child sex abuse claims to be removed,2025-02-05T14:08:15.640Z,Ruth Comerford,"A three-year time limit for child sexual abuse victims to sue for damages will be removed in England and Wales under ""long overdue"" government reforms, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) has said. The MoJ said laws would also be refined to encourage employers to apologise for the actions of current or former employees, so victims would be more likely to receive apologies from institutions like schools, care facilities or hospitals. The government said it was delivering on recommendations laid out in the 2022 Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse (IICSA), led by Prof Alexis Jay. The reforms are expected to be part of bills to be brought before Parliament in the next year. Justice Secretary Shabana Mahmood said the changes recommended by Prof Jay were ""long overdue"". ""These measures help survivors pursue their path to justice,"" she added. Prof Jay had called for an end to the deadline for victims to bring compensation claims. At present, civil child sexual abuse claims must be brought within three years of turning 18, unless the victim can prove a fair trial can proceed despite the time lapse. However, the IICSA reported that a ""significant number"" of claims were being rejected because it could take ""decades for survivors to feel able to discuss their sexual abuse"". Mahmood told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour that the government had ""inherited a situation"" in which Prof Jay's recommendations had not been actioned, adding her department was ""moving at pace"" to implement the suggestions. Change is expected beyond the MoJ, Mahmood added, saying that other government departments mentioned in Prof Jay's recommendations will announce reforms ""in due course"". Kim Harrison, president of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers, said the three-year deadline was ""wholly inappropriate"". ""It will now be the burden of defendants to prove that the passage of time has created an unfair trial, rather than on the victim or survivor to prove a fair trial is possible,"" she said. Last month, the government confirmed it would introduce a mandatory reporting duty for those working with children to report sexual abuse as part of the Crime and Policing Bill. Criminal sanctions will be introduced for both the concealment of, and failure to report, child sexual abuse. Home Secretary Yvette Cooper has also promised to make grooming an aggravated factor in the sentencing of abuse cases and ""overhaul"" how information and evidence on child sexual abuse is gathered. The long wait for the IICSA recommendations to be implemented was thrown into the spotlight in January after tech billionaire Elon Musk attacked the government online in relation to child grooming. Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer accused him and others of ""spreading lies and misinformation"", but weeks later the Home Office announced a nationwide review of grooming gang evidence and five government-backed local inquiries. At the time Cooper said the government would lay out a timetable by Easter for implementing the recommendations in the final report. The row between Mr Musk and Sir Keir centred on high-profile cases where groups of men - mainly of Pakistani descent - were convicted of sexually abusing and raping predominantly young white girls in towns such as Rotherham and Rochdale. Before leading the national inquiry Prof Jay published a report into abuse in Rotherham in 2014, which estimated 1,400 girls had been abused in the Yorkshire town."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93qw3lw4kvo,Mumsnet targeted with child sexual abuse images,2025-02-05T11:15:53.784Z,David Mercer,"Parenting site Mumsnet says it has stopped users from sharing pictures after it was targeted with images of child sexual abuse. Company founder Justine Roberts told the BBC the ""horrific incident"" had been reported to police after the images were posted on the platform over several hours late on Sunday. It has now suspended the facility to post pictures on the site as a temporary measure and is planning to introduce artificial intelligence (AI) filters to flag ""illegal"" and ""disturbing"" images before they appear. Some Mumsnet users have raised concerns about the length of time the images were visible and the site's use of volunteer moderators during overnight hours in the UK. In a thread on Mumsnet following the incident, one user said it was ""time to rethink"" the volunteer moderation system following ""the truly awful photos... which I will never un-see"". ""The site is big enough and money-making enough to support a better system by now,"" the user added. ""There really needs to be proper 24-hour IT cover."" Ms Roberts defended the use of volunteer moderators overnight, saying they were based overseas in different time zones ""so they can easily monitor the site"". ""I don't believe this horrible incident would have been prevented had it happened in office hours with our usual moderation team in London,"" she said. ""The key is to stop this type of horrific thing being posted on our site in the first place and we're putting all our efforts into preventing that from happening again."" ""Several sets"" of child abuse images were posted on Mumsnet between 23:00 GMT on Sunday and 03:00 on Monday, Ms Roberts said. Most of the images were removed within an hour of being posted and all were taken down by 04:00 on Monday, she added. Ms Roberts said it was ""pretty clear"" there was an ""ongoing, co-ordinated effort to further inflame the conversation on (the) site around the issue and to cause as much disruption as possible"". She added that Mumsnet was looking into ""further tools"" that could help prevent future similar incidents. The company is due to meet the Metropolitan Police after reporting the incident on Monday, Ms Roberts said. A Met spokesperson told the BBC it was investigating and no arrests have been made. The spokesperson added that ""we completely understand this is incredibly distressing"" and urged anyone who saw the images and has not yet spoken to police to contact the force. Ms Roberts said Mumsnet was ""regularly subject to threats and attacks from people who seem to want to derail the conversation on site"". ""This latest horrific incident feels like another attempt to do the same,"" she added. ""Over the years we've been swatted [fake calls to the police], attacked by bots and suffered bomb threats amongst other things. ""Right now our team is very focused on preventing any further such horrific images ever appearing on site and helping the police in their attempts to find the person or persons who posted them."" Ms Roberts said moderators who viewed the images of child abuse have been offered support. Mumsnet was founded by Ms Roberts in 2000 as an internet forum for parents to swap advice. It says it now has around nine million unique users per month."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8y28ny1n0o,Why are medical experts disputing evidence used to convict Lucy Letby?,2025-02-04T17:09:49.379Z,Sean Seddon,"Convicted serial killer Lucy Letby is back in the news after a panel of medical experts working with her defence team said they believe the 35-year-old did not commit the murders. The case against the former nurse has been extremely complex from the outset - not least because nobody saw Letby attack the seven babies she was convicted of murdering, nor did anyone witness the attempted murder of seven others. Instead, prosecutors had to draw on technical medical evidence - along with statistical data and other troubling details about Letby's life - in order to prove their case. She was found guilty by a jury and given 15 whole life sentences. Senior judges have twice rejected her efforts to overturn her convictions - but a new report claims Letby is the victim of a miscarriage of justice. Fourteen senior clinicians from around the world have analysed the medical evidence against Letby, including British doctor Neena Modi, a former president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health. The panel was assembled by Dr Shoo Lee, a retired Canadian doctor based at the University of Toronto who specialises in the treatment of young children. He said the panel worked without payment and were not familiar with the case prior to reviewing the evidence. Dr Lee became involved with Letby's defence after being made aware that prosecutors had used a 1989 academic paper he co-authored as part of their case. That paper focused on how air embolisms could lead to a baby's skin becoming discoloured. It was relevant because prosecutors successfully argued that Letby attacked some of her victims by injecting air into them, causing a fatal embolism. Dr Lee has accused the prosecution of misinterpreting his research and he has since published an update discounting a link between marks on the skin and air embolisms. Last year, he offered to give evidence on behalf of Letby during her appeal and to say, in effect, that his research had been misused by the prosecution. However, three senior judges decided Dr Lee's submission should not be considered by the court on the grounds, they said, that the prosecution had not at any point relied solely on evidence of skin discolouration to diagnose an embolism. The new report goes beyond the embolism question Dr Lee has spoken out on previously. BBC News has only seen a summary as a full copy has not been made publicly available. On Tuesday, Dr Lee said the panel believed all of Letby's victims actually died of natural causes or because of poor medical care. ""There was no medical evidence to support malfeasance causing death or injury,"" he told a news conference, before listing what he alleged were a number of wider failings at the Countess of Chester Hospital's neonatal unit where Letby worked. The report deals with the cases of all 14 babies in turn. In one case in which Letby was convicted of killing a baby by injecting air into its stomach, the panel said their analysis indicated a cause of death arising from natural respiratory complications and chronic lung disease. Additionally, they said doctors had failed to detect a bacterial illness and should have prescribed antibiotics. In a case where Letby was convicted of attacking a baby by removing a tube which was allowing the infant to breathe, Dr Lee said the panel's analysis suggests the infant collapsed because it was fitted with the wrong size tube in the first place by a consultant who ""didn't know what he was doing"". There are similar findings for all Letby's victims: the panel said all the deaths could be explained by natural causes or medical errors. However, the criminal case against Letby did not exclusively rely on medical evidence. Prosecutors also pointed to data showing she was on shift when babies fell ill, as well as circumstantial evidence - including the fact she repeatedly researched the families of the deceased and kept records which a judge said were ""morbid records"" of her crimes. Speaking at Tuesday's news conference, Mark McDonald - the barrister leading Letby's defence - argued the circumstantial evidence was of ""lesser"" importance in the case against the nurse compared to the medical evidence. Letby's two previous failed attempts to appeal mean she cannot simply lodge another. Instead, her defence team are attempting to use another route to get a judge to re-examine the case. They have submitted an application to the Criminal Cases Review Commission (CCRC), an independent public body which examines potential miscarriages of justice. The CCRC cannot decide whether someone is innocent or guilty but it can refer a case back to the Court of Appeal if it decides that there is a real possibility someone has wrongly been found guilty. Letby's legal team will need to show that they have uncovered compelling new evidence indicating that she could be innocent in order to get the case back into court. That, they say, is what Dr Lee's findings constitute. However, it will ultimately be up to the CCRC - and potentially the appeal court - to determine whether that is the case. The medical evidence against Letby was analysed in depth during her trial and it could be decided that the panel's arguments were already fully considered and dismissed. On Tuesday, the CCRC said it had received a ""preliminary application"" from Letby's lawyers. Dr Lee said he would not be providing Letby's legal team with his full report until the end of the month, so it could still be some time before the CCRC reaches a decision. Dr Dewi Evans - who was the prosecution's main medical expert - rejected the suggestion that Dr Lee's 1989 paper had been a critical part of the case against Letby. Speaking before a summary of the panel's findings were published, Dr Evans told the Sunday Times the research was ""not a major factor in the prosecution case"". He went on: ""What the prosecution stated was that some of these babies, as part of their collapse, had a skin discolouration which has been described in Dr Lee's paper in 1989, but — and it's an important but — the presence or absence of skin discolourations neither ruled out nor confirmed air embolism. It was not necessary. ""It's a useful paper — I don't want to do it down — but comparing how babies responded to treatment in the 1980s to how they respond to treatment in 2015, it's different.""  A public inquiry led by Lady Justice Thirlwall is investigating the Countess of Chester Hospital's response to the deaths. She has been highly critical of people who have cast doubt on the verdicts, saying it causes ""enormous additional distress to the parents"". The case has also inspired what one KC barrister has described as a ""proliferation of conspiracy theories"" online. Dr Lee's intervention is not the first time experts have raised concerns about Letby's conviction: a group of 24 neonatal experts pushed for the public inquiry to be delayed because they believed ""alternative, potentially complex causes"" for the deaths were not examined and ""important lessons"" were missed. The BBC has also previously spoken to experts who have raised doubts about some of the evidence used to convict Letby. However, none went as far to say as they thought she could be innocent."

Rather than a formal entrance in a royal car, the princess stepped off the minibus holding hands with a little girl as the school trip arrived at the National Portrait Gallery. The head teacher said the royal helper had been ""really chatty"" with the children on the bus, playing I-spy with them and helping with their jumpers. The children were visiting a trail around the gallery encouraging them to think about their emotions, linked to Catherine's early years education project, Shaping Us. ""My name is Catherine and I'm coming on your trip today,"" the princess said to the children as she got on the minibus. ""You've all got your seat belts on?"" she checked. ""It was an experience we probably won't ever have again,"" said head teacher Alix Ascough of All Souls primary school in Westminster. ""She was wonderful, so relaxed with the children, really chatty. Children were so engaged with her, playing I-spy with her at one point and helping with jumpers,"" said the head teacher. Catherine, who held hands with a girl called Grace during the visit by the reception class, helped children as they drew their own portraits in a gallery filled with pictures of famous faces. The gallery, which has Catherine as its royal patron, has opened an interactive, storytelling trail for young children, with activities encouraging them to think about their emotions as they create their own self-portrait. Catherine's Shaping Us initiative emphasises the importance of the first five years of children's lives - and the latest stage of the project calls for a greater emphasis on teaching social skills and improving mental health. The free exhibition for children at the National Portrait Gallery picks up on the themes about understanding emotions. Liz Smith, the gallery's director of learning, said children could be the ""harshest critics"" but they had responded well to the project. The gallery visit is another part of Catherine's gradual return to work after completing her cancer treatment. She marked World Cancer Day by releasing a photo taken of her by her six-year-old son Prince Louis. The princess, who revealed last month that she is in remission from cancer, has been calling for a ""rebalance"" in society to encourage people to show more compassion and empathy. King Charles is continuing his cancer treatment and the Royal Family's social media channel had a message ""sending love to all those navigating a cancer diagnosis – as well as the incredible doctors, nurses, charities and families who work tirelessly to support them"".

Dame Anna, the longest-serving editor-in-chief of Vogue magazine, was made Companion of Honour for her services to fashion. She was honoured in the 2023 King's Birthday Honours and joins the likes of Dame Judi Dench, Sir Elton John, David Hockney and Sir Paul McCartney in the select group. ""It makes me even more convinced that I have so much more to achieve,"" she said. Dressed in Alexander McQueen, Dame Anna told reporters on Tuesday she was ""completely surprised and overwhelmed"" to receive her second accolade at Buckingham Palace. She was made a dame in 2017 by Queen Elizabeth II, who honoured her for her contribution to fashion and journalism. ""The last time I was here the Queen gave me a medal and we both agreed that we had been doing our job a very long time, and then this morning His Majesty asked me if this meant I was going to stop working and I said firmly, no,"" she said. Last month, she also went without her trademark shades as former US President Joe Biden presented her with the Presidential Medal of Freedom - America's highest civilian honour - at the White House. The 75-year-old previously told the BBC the glasses are a ""prop"". ""They help me be seen and not be seen,"" she said. One of the most significant players in fashion, Dame Anna has been editor-in-chief of Vogue since 1988 and, among other charities, has helped raise more than $20m (£16m) for Aids research. She has organised annual fundraiser the Met Gala, in New York, since 1995 and has also raised money for UK arts organisations following funding cuts in 2022. The Order of the Companions of Honour is an exclusive group, limited to 65 people at any one time. Appointments go to those who have made a long-standing contribution to the arts, science, medicine or government. Tracey Emin, 61, one of Britain's most acclaimed artists, was also honoured at the investiture ceremony on Tuesday as she was made a dame. Speaking afterwards, she said her 2020 bladder cancer diagnosis had made her focus on ""helping other people"". In March 2023 her Tracey Emin Foundation opened its doors in Margate, offering rent-free space to art students. ""I think if you come from an impoverished background, it's almost impossible to even get your qualifications and get into university,"" said Dame Tracey. ""But one thing I would say is: do not be put off by the fees. ""Go to university and worry about it afterwards, because otherwise, if you don't have the education, you can't change anything."" Her notable works include My Bed, an art installation at the Tate Gallery exhibiting her own unmade bed and a floor littered with empty vodka bottles, cigarette butts and condoms.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyk521rrxyo,Celebrity butt-lift injector who left women with sepsis exposed by BBC,2025-02-04T06:03:06.818Z,Shona Elliott and Ruth Clegg,"A self-styled ""beauty consultant"", whose celebrity client list includes Katie Price, is offering potentially dangerous cosmetic procedures to clients and handing over medication illegally - a BBC investigation has discovered. Ricky Sawyer specialises in liquid Brazilian butt-lifts (BBLs) - which involves injecting dermal filler into buttocks to lift them and make them look bigger. BBC News has spoken to five of his clients who needed emergency hospital treatment after their procedures. We have also been shown the testimonies of more than 30 women who say they have been left with serious complications such as sepsis and necrosis (tissue death). One woman told us she felt at the time she would rather ""have died"" than continue with the pain she was in following the treatment. Several local authorities have banned Mr Sawyer from practising in their areas. Our undercover filming captured Mr Sawyer handing out antibiotics without a valid prescription - a criminal offence. He is not qualified to prescribe and the pills were not labelled for a specific patient. He also offered to inject increasing doses of local anaesthetic without a prescriber present - again illegal - and did not ask for our reporter's weight, thus putting her at risk of an overdose. Posing as a potential client and her friend, we had booked a 45-minute appointment with Mr Sawyer through his Instagram page. We told him we wanted a 200ml (7fl oz) liquid BBL injection costing £1,200. We paid a £200 deposit. Despite having advertised that all liquid BBLs would be carried out under the guidance of an ""ultrasound specialist doctor"", none was present at his pop-up clinic. He was working out of a small room in an east London office block - a non-clinical environment which would have increased the risk of infection. Within five minutes of being in his office, Mr Sawyer had begun to encourage our reporter to think about increasing the amount of filler. ""You might be surprised about how much product you can have and still look natural,"" he suggested. By the end of the appointment, Mr Sawyer had offered to inject a litre of filler - 500ml (almost a pint) per buttock - at a cost of £2,000. We did not go through with it and later returned to put our allegations to him - but he refused to answer our questions and slammed the door on our reporter. Reviewing our footage, plastic surgeon Dalvi Humzah, who sits on the Joint Council of Cosmetic Practitioners, said Mr Sawyer's actions were ""shocking"", ""very dangerous"", and putting patients at a huge risk of infection and potentially fatal complications. ""Putting that volume in, in one sitting, is really dangerous,"" said Mr Humzah. ""The buttocks are such a large area that if they become infected it can overwhelm the body and could end in sepsis - or even death."" The filler used for liquid BBLs is often made up of hyaluronic acid, which is commonly used in facial filling treatments. Because large amounts of the acid are involved in BBLs, and there is a risk of serious side effects such as blood clots and sepsis, it is regarded as one of the most dangerous cosmetic procedures. Mr Sawyer boasted on camera that he did up to seven procedures a day, six days a week. He can charge thousands of pounds per appointment. One of the women who said she had experienced serious complications after receiving a liquid BBL from Mr Sawyer was Joanne. A mum of two from south Wales, who only wants us to use her first name, she travelled seven hours to Essex for the treatment. Having had other cosmetic treatments before and having been persuaded by Ricky Sawyer's many adverts and celebrity endorsements, a liquid BBL didn't seem like such a big step to her. All she wanted, she says, was a ""peachy bum"". But when Joanne arrived, she began to have second thoughts. She had only been sent a postcode and says she seemed to be walking into an industrial estate. In the end, she found a small door into a block of flats and says she was told to wait in a ""dingy little hallway"" for about half an hour. ""I should have turned and ran,"" she says, ""but I had paid £600 deposit and travelled all this way."" She was taken into a small room where there ""was only a bed, a tiny stool and a worktop"", and that is where she says she first met Ricky Sawyer. After counting out the rest of her cash - £2,000 in total - she says he told her to stand in front of him while he sat on the stool. As he started to inject her with a litre (1.8 pints) of filler, the pain quickly became unbearable. ""I felt dizzy, sick and like shaky. My legs didn't even move properly. And that was all within a minute of him starting,"" she says. ""I remember looking round and he had white gloves on that were full of blood."" By the end of the procedure, Joanne was in agony: ""I was in so much pain, my bottom was completely disfigured."" She says she could barely sit down. By the time she got home the swelling had started and she could hardly walk. ""I messaged Ricky loads of times to say how bad I was feeling and how worried I was. He just told me to take my antibiotics."" By this point, sepsis had begun to set in. ""My temperature kept on going up and I felt terrible,"" says Joanne. ""I had to phone 999. I was dripping with sweat and screaming."" In hospital, she was attached to intravenous antibiotics. At one point, a surgeon drew on her buttock to indicate where they might need to cut, because the infection was spreading so quickly. After messaging Ricky Sawyer saying she was in hospital with sepsis, she says he blocked her from his Instagram account. Fortunately, Joanne did not need an operation. Another of Mr Sawyer's clients, Louise Moller, did need life-saving emergency surgery. Four days after receiving a liquid BBL at his Essex clinic in October 2023, the 28-year-old from Bolton was in hospital. She rang her mother, Janet, from Salford Royal's A&E department saying: ""Mum, I think I'm going to die."" Louise had developed sepsis and was warned by surgeons that she could die at any minute. To stop the infection from moving through her body, they cut dead tissue out of an area almost covering her entire left buttock. Janet promised her daughter she would prevent this from happening to anyone else and reported Ricky Sawyer to their local police station in Bolton. ""How can he carry on knowing he could kill someone?"" she told the BBC. However, Louise's case highlights the difficulty in holding practitioners like him accountable. Janet says she was told by police in Bolton that the file would need to be passed to Essex Police, where the incident happened. A prosecution could be difficult however, she was warned, because Louise had signed a consent form. BBC News has approached both Greater Manchester Police and Essex Police to get an update on the case - both have said it is down to the other to investigate. From a legal point of view, there is little to stop Mr Sawyer from practising. Injecting dermal fillers is seen as non-surgical and is unregulated, which means anyone can do it - and they can't be struck off and stopped. In September 2024, Alice Webb is believed to have become the first person to die after receiving a liquid BBL in the UK. Her procedure was not carried out by Ricky Sawyer. Following her death, Save Face - a group that campaigns for greater regulation to cover non-surgical procedures - called for a new law banning liquid BBLs from being carried out by anyone other than surgeons registered with the General Medical Council (GMC). Save Face's founder, Ashton Collins, says her organisation has received complaints from 39 women about Ricky Sawyer. All the women, she says, have told her they have been left needing urgent hospital treatment. Each of them, she says, had a BBL and suffered complications such as sepsis, necrosis and disfigurement. ""We've encouraged these women to report their experiences to the police,"" she says. ""Some have, and nothing has been done."" So far, the most effective action has been taken by local authorities, three of which - Glasgow City Council, Epping Forest District Council and Brentwood Council - confirmed they had issued prohibition notices under Health and Safety law to protect the public from serious injury. But ""he just moves on to different areas of the country and carries on"", says Ms Collins. We put our evidence to the Department of Health and Social Care which said it was ""urgently looking at options for tougher regulation"". It said our findings were ""shocking"" and that those caught ""dispensing medication without a licence should feel the full force of the law"". We attempted to put our allegations to Ricky Sawyer in person, by confronting him at his east London clinic. As soon as he saw the camera he tried to slam the door on us, before hiding behind it. We asked him if he was breaking the law by handing out prescription-only medicine, and if he had anything to say to the women who say they were left with such serious injuries that they needed emergency care. ""No,"" he said - and told us to leave. The dangers of unregulated cosmetic surgery should be taken far more seriously, says Ashton Collins. ""The general vibe that you pick up is that these are silly women that have made silly choices, driven through vanity, and it's their own fault."" It is an attitude that needs to change, she adds: ""People are out there taking risks with people's lives, and they can do so with impunity.""

The image shows Catherine in a frosty woodland scene, arms open and well wrapped up, and was taken in Windsor in recent weeks. Alongside the photo, the princess posted the words: ""Don't forget to nurture all that which lies beyond the disease."" The picture is said by Kensington Palace to reflect how spending time in nature has been important to the princess, who announced in January she is in remission from cancer. This is the first photo taken by Louis that has been shared on royal social media channels as he follows in the footsteps of his mother, who has been an enthusiastic photographer. At the weekend, Catherine called for a ""rebalance"" in society to allow people to prioritise their physical and mental health. She is gradually returning to work after completing her cancer treatment - and launched a new stage in her early years education project encouraging more empathy and kindness. ""At times, it can feel like the world is filled with mistrust and misunderstanding, leaving many people feeling isolated and vulnerable during difficult times,"" she wrote in her charity's report. She brought a message of support for those currently undergoing cancer treatment when last month she visited the Royal Marsden Hospital in west London, where she had been a patient. This latest photograph is another indication of her continuing support, ahead of World Cancer Day, and how much she seems to have been motivated to help others by her own experience of ill health.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gwq2vjpvko,Coercive control to be treated like other domestic abuse offences,2025-02-03T16:11:59.782Z,Imogen James,"Offenders convicted of coercive or controlling behaviour now face tougher management from police and probation services in England and Wales, meaning the crime is ""on a par"" with other domestic abuse offences. From Monday, those convicted of the crime and sentenced to 12 months or more will automatically be managed under multi-agency public protection arrangements (Mappa). Under Mappa, the police, probation, prison services and other agencies are legally required to work together to better manage the risks posed by the offenders. For the first time, it puts controlling or coercive behaviour on a par with other domestic abuse offences, including threats to kill and stalking, the Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said. Agencies are legally required under Mappa to share any information which indicates an increased risk to former partners and members of the public. Offenders managed under the scheme have a reoffending rate less than half of the national average, according to the MoJ. Coercive control is a psychological type of domestic abuse where the perpetrator uses threats, humiliation and intimidation to harm and frighten the victim. Over a period of time, this can isolate the victim and deprive them of their independence. It is often seen alongside other forms of domestic abuse, and has been a criminal offence in the UK since 2015. Samantha Billingham was in a controlling and abusive relationship where she said she ""lost her sense of identity, belonging and purpose"". She said coercive control had a ""huge effect"" on her life even after leaving the relationship, and she lost the ability to trust people including long-term friends. Ms Billingham said the tougher management of offenders was ""a step in the right direction"" but added: ""I don't feel it's enough alone. ""Survivors must be believed and taken seriously when reporting coercive control. ""Education is key and awareness is power - we need it in all schools, colleges and universities. We need our young people to know the early warning signs and what coercive control is."" A change in the law around the management of people convicted of controlling or coercive behaviour was introduced in the Victims and Prisoners Act 2024 by the previous government, and comes into force on Monday. Before this, those convicted could only be actively managed on a discretionary basis. The law change applies to offenders sentenced to at least 12 months' imprisonment, including suspended sentences, or those given a hospital order for an offence of controlling or coercive behaviour in an intimate or family relationship. Jess Phillips, the minister for safeguarding and violence against women and girls, said: ""For the first time, under this change to the law, coercive or controlling behaviour is being placed where it belongs – on a par with serious violent offending."" Women's Aid said it welcomed plans to treat the crime ""seriously"". The charity's chief executive Farah Nazeer said coercive control was a ""key tool used by perpetrators of domestic abuse, as it isolates survivors and makes them dependent on an abuser"". She added that it was ""essential"" for specialist domestic abuse services to be routinely included in the Mappa process ""if survivors are to be properly protected by this measure"". If you are affected by any of the issues raised, help and support is available via BBC Action Line."

The 28-year-old, who has played nine times for Australia, was reported for a suspect action during the second Test against Sri Lanka in Galle earlier this month. Subsequent independent testing has shown the bend in his elbow falls within the permitted 15 degrees, leaving him free to continue bowling. ""It was a disappointing way to finish what was such a successful Test series for Australia,"" Kuhnemann said in a statement on Thursday. ""I've never doubted my bowling action throughout my career and I'm always looking to improve the art of spin bowling in different conditions. ""I appreciated the professional manner in which testing was explained to me and then conducted."" Cricket Australia executive general manager Ben Oliver said: ""We are pleased for Matt that this matter is now resolved. ""It has been a challenging period for Matt. However, he has carried himself exceptionally well. ""He has had the full support of Australian cricket and he can now move forward to the next phase of his international career with great confidence.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz03l18jv97o,Couple's trauma after body placed next to them on flight,2025-02-26T09:48:54.959Z,Maia Davies,"An Australian couple have spoken of the ""traumatic"" moment the body of a dead passenger was placed next to them on a Qatar Airways flight. Mitchell Ring and Jennifer Colin, who were travelling to Venice for a dream holiday, told Australia's Channel 9 a woman had died in the aisle beside them during the flight from Melbourne to Doha. The couple say cabin crew placed her corpse, covered in blankets, next to Mr Ring for the remaining four hours of the flight without offering to move him, despite there being empty seats. Qatar Airways said it apologised for ""any inconvenience or distress this incident may have caused"". The couple said they had not been contacted or offered support by Qatar Airways or Qantas, the airline through which they booked the flight. In a later statement on Wednesday, Qatar Airways said it had now spoken with the affected passengers to address their concerns, as well as the family of the woman who died. Mr Ring told Channel Nine's Current Affair programme that staff had responded ""in no time"" when the woman collapsed, but that ""unfortunately the lady couldn't be saved, which was pretty heart-breaking to watch"". He said the cabin crew had tried to move her body towards business class ""but she was quite a large lady and they couldn't get her through the aisle"". Mr Ring said the crew had seen seats were available beside him. ""They said, 'Can you move over please?' and I just said, 'Yes no problem'. ""Then they placed the lady in the chair I was in."" While Ms Colin was able to move to an empty seat nearby, Mr Ring said he had not been given the option to do so by cabin crew - even though there were vacant seats. When the plane landed four hours later, he said passengers were asked to stay put while medical staff and police came on board. He said ambulance officers had then started pulling blankets off the woman and he had seen her face. The couple said there needed to be a ""duty of care"" for customers and staff. ""We should be contacted to make sure, do you need some support, do you need some counselling?"" Ms Colin called the experience ""traumatic"" and said: ""We totally understand that we can't hold the airline responsible for the poor lady's death, but there has to be a protocol to look after the customers on board."" In its latest statement, Qatar Airways said: ""We have been in contact with the family of the passenger who passed away to express our condolences on their loss. We have also directly spoken with the affected passengers to address their concerns. ""The safety and comfort of all our passengers is of paramount importance to us."" A Qantas spokesperson said: ""The process for handling incidents onboard an aircraft like this is managed by the operating airline, which in this case is Qatar Airways."" Barry Eustance, a former Virgin Atlantic captain, said deaths in the air ""occur more frequently than people would think"" but said as a far as he was aware there was no specific protocol in place for such situations. ""On a long haul flight it tends to depend largely on when it occurs and where it occurs and what the crew have in terms of facilities to place the body somewhere because on an aeroplane, there's no access to the hold, there's a crew rest area but that's for the crew so it can be problematical."" A toilet area or galley area could be blocked off, he said, but the crew are required to keep a certain number of toilets available. Mr Eustance said that, while he was not being judgemental as he did not know the full situation, he was surprised that the crew did not move Mr Ring if there had been spare seats. ""I would expect the crew would do all they could to avoid that. You are creating potential future liabilities in terms of the trauma of the people next to whom the body was placed,"" he said. ""In my experience the crew would normally try to isolate the body, so there is no passenger exposure to the body and vice versa, for respect and privacy but also for medical reasons. You have a dead body that is uncontained and all that goes with it."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9yxvjx19go,Religious sect parents jailed over death of diabetic daughter,2025-02-26T09:25:29.478Z,Simon Atkinson,"The parents of an eight-year-old diabetic girl in Australia who died after they denied her insulin for almost a week have each been sentenced to 14 years in jail for manslaughter. Elizabeth Struhs had in 2019 been diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and her family was told she would need daily insulin injections. Her parents belonged to a religious sect known as The Saints, who opposed medical care, believing God would heal her. She died from diabetic ketoacidosis, which causes a dangerous build-up of ketones - a type of acid - and blood sugar spikes at her home in Toowoomba west of Brisbane in January 2022. Her father Jason Struhs and mother Elizabeth Struhs, were among 14 people convicted of manslaughter last month. The Saints' leader Brendan Stevens has been jailed for 13 years by the judge at the Supreme Court of Queensland, who called him a ""dangerous, highly manipulative individual"". Eleven other members were handed jail terms of six to nine years. Stevens and the girl's father had been on trial for murder but they were convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. All had pleaded not guilty. When handing down his almost 500-page verdict last month, Justice Martin Burns said that although it was clear Elizabeth's parents and ""every member of the church including all other accused"" had adored her, their actions had resulted in her death. ""Due to a singular belief in the healing power of God… she was deprived of the one thing that would most definitely have kept her alive."" Elizabeth would have endured vomiting, extreme lethargy, and a loss of consciousness because she was denied medical care, prosecutor Caroline Marco said during the trial, which lasted several months and was heard by a judge sitting alone without a jury. Prosecutors called 60 witnesses and painted a picture of an ""intelligent"" child who suffered greatly in her final days. The congregation, meanwhile, had prayed and sung for the girl as she lay on a mattress and her condition deteriorated. Believing she could be brought back to life, the sect member made no effort to call a doctor, and authorities were not notified until 36 hours after her death, the court heard. ""Elizabeth is only sleeping, and I will see her again,"" her father Jason Struhs had earlier told the court. Stevens, 63, had defended the group's actions as faith-based and described the trial as an act of ""religious persecution"". He said that the group was within its ""rights to believe in the word of God completely"". Type 1 diabetes is a disorder in which the pancreas fails to produce enough insulin. It is characterised by uncontrolled high blood glucose levels and it can be controlled by injecting insulin. Elizabeth's sister Jayde Struhs had earlier said she had left the Saints and fled her family home at 16, after coming out as gay, and was now estranged from them. She and other witnesses described the congregation as having strict views, including that mainstream healthcare should be shunned and that both Christmas and Easter were ""pagan"" or ungodly festivals. The Saints are not affiliated with an established church in Australia and count around two dozen members from three families among its members."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5dym4ye30o,Australia host loses job over offensive women's football remarks,2025-02-26T08:31:24.184Z,Simon Atkinson,"An Australian radio presenter has left the network after comments he made about the country's women's football team – which have been branded as misogynist and disrespectful. Marty Sheargold said on nationwide radio station Triple M that the Matildas players reminded him of ""year 10 girls"" and implied that their matches were boring. He apologised earlier on Wednesday, and was due to be back on air but did not appear in his usual time slot. Southern Cross Austereo (SCA), the parent company of Triple M, later said Sheargold and the station had agreed to ""mutually part ways"". In a statement on Wednesday, Sheargold said that he fully understood the gravity of his remarks and would like to ""sincerely apologise to the Matildas and the broader organisation"". The company said that it ""takes its responsibility to listeners, shareholders, and clients seriously and its programming should align with the standards and expectations of its audience."" ""Right now, it's clear this is a moment for reflection and review. Triple M, and the wider SCA network, will continue to take all necessary steps to support staff,"" the firm's chief content officer Dave Cameron said in a statement. Earlier the sport's governing body said the remarks ""diminish the extraordinary achievements"" of a team that were semi-finalists in the women's world cup in 2023. During his drivetime show on Monday afternoon, Sheargold interjected during a sports bulletin - which was discussing Australia's defeat to the US in its second consecutive loss in the SheBelieves Cup. ""You know what they remind me of? Year 10 girls,"" Sheargold said, to the laughter of his co-hosts. ""All the infighting and all the friendship issues... Now I'm sorry to undermine the whole sport, but that's what I think of it."" When his colleague mentioned the SheBelieves Cup by name, Sheargold interrupted saying: ""Oh, she believes in what? It better be men."" And when reference was made to Australia hosting the AFC Women's Asian Cup next year, he said ""oh god - the Asian Cup"", before criticising the event with an obscene comment. He then asked his co-host: ""Got any men's sport?"" Sheargold's comments later went viral. Minister for Sport Anika Wells called the comments ""boorish, boring and wrong"". ""Australia's most watched television event ever was the Matildas World Cup semi-final; the Tillies' quarterfinal is the second-most-watched event in Australian history,"" Ms Wells said. Australian Olympian Ambrosia Malone, who represents her country in hockey, also criticised Sheargold. ""All I could think about was the young girls sitting in the car with their parents, maybe on the way to or from their own training sessions hearing this,"" she wrote on social media. ""I'm sure many of them would have been hurt and confused… I was in disbelief. ""This is apparently acceptable on mainstream afternoon radio??? HOW??"" Football Australia said it was ""deeply disappointed by the unacceptable comments"" which ""fail to recognise the profound impact they have had on Australian sport and society"". ""This incident is a stark reminder of the responsibility media outlets and personalities have in fostering respectful and constructive discussions about women's sport and its participants,"" it added."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8710r5v0p7o,"Neighbours cancelled again, two years after revival",2025-02-21T09:24:18.801Z,Tiffanie Turnbull,"Beloved Australian soap drama Neighbours has been cancelled again, two years after it was saved by Amazon MGM Studios. Without specifying a reason, Amazon confirmed the series will finish at the end of 2025 - 40 years and more than 9,000 episodes after its television debut. It was dropped by Channel 5 in 2022, but revived by Amazon for its streaming platforms just four months after a star-studded farewell episode watched by millions. The soap - which helped launched the careers of Kylie Minogue, Guy Pearce and Margot Robbie - has long been a huge hit with Australian and UK audiences, and last year received its first Emmy nomination. A statement on the show's social media said the soap would be ""resting"" from December. ""Audiences all around the world have loved and embraced Neighbours for four decades and we are very proud of the huge success over the last two years,"" executive producer Jason Herbison wrote. ""We value how much the fans love Neighbours and we believe there are more stories of the residents of Ramsay Street to tell in the future,"" Mr Hebrison added, hinting that the producers will again hunt for a new backer. New episodes will continue to air on Amazon Prime Video and Australia's Channel Ten four times a week until the end of 2025. In a statement, Amazon MGM Studios said it was ""proud"" to have played ""a small part"" in Neighbours history. ""Forty years is an incredible milestone,"" a spokesperson said. Fans vented their disappointment at the decision. One wrote on social media: ""I refuse point blank to accept that they will try to take @neighbours from me AGAIN!!! It's sometimes the only 20 minutes in the day I can escape. Absolutely blooming well not!!"" Someone else wrote: ""I can't begin to count the number of times I've logged into @primevideouk to be greeted by #Neighbours sitting at the top of the weekly charts. ""Now @amazon have cancelled the soap. At least a few of us will save money when we cancel though, right?"" Another said: ""Will be so sad to say goodbye again, the joy & comfort this show has given for 40 years."" Set and filmed in Melbourne, Neighbours was first broadcast in Australia in 1985 and launched on BBC One a year later. The show has lately featured more diverse characters and storylines, amid questions over how well it reflected modern Australia. It featured the first same-sex marriage on Australian TV. It also had its controversies, however. A number of actors recently came forward with racism allegations, prompting production company Fremantle Media to promise a review. News of the show's cancellation comes after actor Ian Smith - who plays Ramsay Street stalwart Harold Bishop - last year announced he would leave the show, revealing he has terminal cancer. It also follows cutbacks elsewhere to TV soaps, including to the numbers of episodes of British shows Coronation Street, Emmerdale and Hollyoaks."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz65p1k45o,"Children routinely using social media, Australian regulator says",2025-02-20T14:31:30.425Z,Graham Fraser,"More than 80% of Australian children aged eight to 12 use social media or messaging services that are only meant to be for over-13s, according to new research. It comes as Australia plans to implement a total social media ban for under-16s that is expected by the end of this year. The country's internet regulator, eSafety, found YouTube, TikTok and Snapchat were the most popular platforms used by young children. The regulator accused the apps of ""a lack of robust interventions"" for checking the ages of their users. The platforms which were examined for the study were Discord, Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube. Users of all of these platforms must be 13 and over to have an account, though there are some exceptions. For example, YouTube has Family Link - when an account is accessible for children under the age of 13 under the supervision of a guardian - and the separate app YouTube Kids, which is specifically made for children. In the report, usage of YouTube Kids was not included for this reason. It has been reported that YouTube is likely to be spared from the social media ban when it comes into force. ""The findings of this report will be a helpful input to guide next steps,"" said eSafety commissioner Julie Inman Grant. Australia's robust stance on social media for young people is being keenly watched by the rest of the world - including the UK which has not ruled out copying its ban for young users. In its responses to the study, TikTok and Meta - the parent company of Facebook and Instagram - took the opportunity to criticise the Australian authorities over its stance on YouTube. ""This report again shines a spotlight on the government's decision to give an exclusive carve out to the most popular social media platform for young Australians from the under 16 ban,"" said a TikTok spokesperson. ""Australian parents and guardians have a right to know what evidence, if any, supports the government's decision."" A Meta spokesperson said they believed the best way to ensure age verification was for a user's real age to be determined when first using a device's operating system and its app store, which would then be able to subsequently signal a user's age to all the social media companies. Researchers questioned over 1,500 children across Australia aged between eight and 15 about their usage of social media and messaging platforms. They found 84% of the children aged between eight and 12 who were surveyed had used at least one social media or messaging service since the beginning of last year. Over half of them used it via the account of a parent or carer. Staying with that age bracket, a third of the children who had used social media or messaging services had their own account, and 80% of them had help setting up their account/accounts from a parent or carer. The study also found only 13% of children who had an account had them shut down by the social media companies or messaging services for being under the age of 13. If you take YouTube out of the findings entirely, the report found 44% of children aged eight to 12 who were surveyed had used at least one other social media platform last year. ""These findings indicate there is inconsistency across industry regarding the steps taken to assess the age of end-users at various points in the user experience,"" the report's authors said. ""However, there is one thing they have in common: a lack of robust interventions at the point of account sign-up to a service to prevent someone under 13 from providing a false age or birthdate to set up an account."" The regulator's report also surveyed the platforms themselves, which were asked how they verify the ages of younger users. Snapchat, TikTok, Twitch and YouTube told the authors they deployed tools and technology to detect whether a user may be under the age of 13 once they were using the service. ""Proactive tools and technologies may rely on a user actively engaging with a service (such as connecting with others, communicating with others, sharing and creating content) to detect relevant signals,"" the report said. ""This may require time and engagement to detect a child under 13, and in that time the child may be exposed to risks and harms."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rkx37vd6zo,Australian woman charged with assaulting two Muslims,2025-02-19T08:12:23.359Z,Joel Guinto,"Australian police have charged a 31-year-old woman for assaulting two Muslim women at a shopping centre in Melbourne last week. The woman from Pascoe Vale suburb is due in court on Wednesday, where it will be alleged that she targeted the two victims on 13 February because of their head coverings, local media report. She allegedly grabbed and choked a 30-year-old pregnant woman using the latter's hijab at Epping shopping centre before pushing and slapping another 26-year-old woman in a separate assault 10 minutes later. This comes two weeks after the country passed tough new laws against hate crimes following a recent string of high-profile antisemitic attacks. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese on Wednesday condemned the incident as ""reprehensible"". He rejected criticism that his government was taking Islamophobic attacks less seriously compared to antisemitic attacks. ""I take all attacks on people on the basis of their faith seriously, and they should all face the full force of the law,"" he told reporters. Melbourne police say they are investigating reports of online threats against one of the two victims in the shopping centre. Both suffered non-life-threatening injuries. On Tuesday, Australia's anti-Islamophobia envoy, Aftab Malik, told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation that ""all forms of hate need to stop"" and that the country's leaders must condemn the incident in Melbourne. Earlier in the week, the president of the Australian Federation of Islamic Councils, Rateb Jneid, expressed alarm over attacks on Muslims in the country and called the government's response ""grossly insufficient"".  Australia's government has described new laws passed in early February as the ""toughest laws Australia has ever had against hate crimes"". It imposes mandatory jail terms ranging from one to six years for the use of hate symbols such as the Nazi salute. The reforms come as attacks on Jewish targets have become a topic of fierce debate in the country. Last week, two Australian nurses were suspended after a video appeared to show them threatening to kill Israeli patients and boasting about refusing to treat them. In late January, Sydney police found a caravan containing explosives and an antisemitic note. A week before that, set alight and sprayed with antisemitic messages"

A team of experts at the site said complex conditions have made it impossible to save them. They are part of a pod of 157 whales that had beached near Arthur River, in the island's north west. The rest had died shortly after the stranding. Tasmania has seen a series of mass whale strandings in recent years - including the country's worst-ever in 2020 - but false killer whales haven't mass stranded there in over 50 years. False killer whales are technically one of world's largest dolphin species, like their orca namesakes. They can grow up to 6m (19ft) and weigh 1.5 tonnes. Authorities on Wednesday said the pod had been stranded at the site for 24 to 48 hours, and the surviving animals were already under extreme stress. Local resident Jocelyn Flint told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation she had travelled to the site on Wednesday morning after her son noticed the pod while out shark fishing overnight. ""There are babies... There's just families of them. Their eyes are open, they're looking at me, like 'help'."" ""It's just absolutely horrific."" The site - about 300km (186 miles) from the city of Launceston - is extremely difficult to access and transport any rescue equipment to, marine biologist Kris Carlyon told media. ""This is possibly the trickiest location I've seen in 16 years of doing this role in Tasmania,"" he said. ""We're talking a very rough, steep, single lane road into the site. We can get four-wheel drives in there, but not a lot else."" Rough conditions meant returning the animals to the sea at the location they stranded was impossible, so an expert team tried to relocate two and refloat them, but were unsuccessful. ""The animals just can't get past the break to get out. They just keep turning around and coming back towards the beach,"" said Shelley Graham, from Tasmania's Parks and Wildlife Service. With conditions for the next two days forecast to be similar, expert wildlife veterinarians made the ""tough"" and ""confronting"" decision to euthanise the remaining whales. ""The longer these animals are out stranded, the longer they are suffering. All alternative options have been unsuccessful, euthanasia is always a last resort,"" Dr Carlyon said. That grim task - which involves shooting the animals - is expected to begin on Wednesday but continue on Thursday. Authorities are still working out how to dispose of the carcasses. The site has important cultural heritage for Aboriginal people so a department spokesperson earlier suggested ""it may be a case of... letting nature run its course"". Authorities have asked members of the public to avoid the site, with bushfires burning nearby and limited road access. More than 80% of Australian whale strandings take place in Tasmania - often on its west coast. Around 470 pilot whales were stranded further south at Macquarie Harbour in 2020 and about 350 of them died despite rescue efforts. Another 200 become stranded in the same harbour in 2022. Whales are highly social mammals and are well known for stranding in groups because they travel in large, close-knit communities which rely on constant communication. There are a range of theories for why beachings occur. Some experts say the animals can become disorientated after following fish they hunt to the shore. Others believe that one individual can mistakenly lead whole groups to shore.

https://www.bbc.com/sport/football/articles/c20kezxd0r9o,Not guilty - but how will Kerr trial affect her career?,2025-02-12T18:11:58.881Z,,"Sam Kerr may have been found not guilty of causing racially aggravated harassment but that is not the end of the story for one of women's football's most high-profile players. There is a lingering question over how much lasting damage it will have on her reputation and career. After the case, the Australia and Chelsea player apologised ""for expressing myself poorly on what was a traumatic evening"". The trial heard Kerr and her partner Kristie Mewis had been out drinking when they were driven to Twickenham Police Station by a taxi driver who complained that they had refused to pay clean-up costs after Kerr was sick, and Mewis had smashed the vehicle's rear window. Kerr said she and her partner had feared for their lives and in an expletive-laden exchange, accused one of the police officers of being ""stupid and white"". Kerr was supported by her parents and brother Levi throughout the case. Her fiancee Mewis was in the public gallery once she had finished giving evidence as a witness for the defence. When the verdict was read out, Kerr did not show much emotion while Mewis was in tears in the public gallery. But when court broke, Kerr gave an enthusiastic thumbs up to her barrister, Grace Forbes.  When it came to character evidence, Kerr had the support of high-profile figures in the world of football as well as family and friends including former Chelsea manager Emma Hayes and captain Millie Bright, who provided written references. Ex-Chelsea and England goalkeeper Carly Telford was the only character witness to give evidence in court, and said that while her former team-mate was ""exuberant"" on the pitch, she was ""quite shy and humble"" off it. Kerr herself acknowledged that being reminded of her behaviour on the night in question was ""embarrassing"", and apologised in court and again in her post-trial statement for the way she had expressed herself. The significance of this court case was not lost on Kerr or those associated with her. Chelsea had a legal representative in court for the entirety of it, and Kerr made additions to her public relations team in advance of the trial getting under way. Tim Crow, a sports marketing expert, said: ""There are plenty of precedents for athletes coming back from controversies like this, and taking their careers to new heights. ""There are two critical factors for Sam Kerr going forward. The first is her performance on the field: everything flows from that. The second is how she chooses to portray herself off the field, in her own voice through the media to control the narrative, or through sponsors. ""On the latter, it will be interesting to see how her existing sponsors react, and if any new sponsors come forward to back her, as she is now on the front line of the culture wars, at least for the time being."" BBC Sport has contacted Kerr's personal sponsors - Nike, Commbank and Australian mobile phone service Mate - for comment. It remains to be seen how supporters react when Kerr returns to the pitch for the first time following this trial. Kerr has been the subject of abuse previously, including homophobia. The announcement she is expecting a child with Mewis drew homophobic comments online, which were condemned by Chelsea manager Sonia Bompastor. Blues supporters groups have celebrated the verdict, with Chelsea Pride among those to post online tributes
, external
to Kerr on Tuesday. Chelsea have not yet made any comment about the case. There was significant media interest in this case for the duration, not just among British media but Australian media. The public gallery was so full that the court had to find extra seats for reporters, and each day there was a large number of camera crews and reporters filming and photographing Kerr's arrival at and departure from court. Kerr is arguably the most famous sportswoman in Australia, having been the face of the Matildas' home World Cup in 2023 in which they came fourth. Her status has seen Kerr become a symbol of Australia around the world outside of sport, and she was the national flag bearer at the coronation of King Charles III. Following the outcome of the trial, Football Australia welcomed Kerr's statement, and spoke of her importance to the team. ""Sam has been a key figure in Australian football for many years, and we recognise the significant pressures that this matter has brought to everyone involved,"" the statement read. Football Australia said it would ""reflect with Sam on learnings from this matter"", but stopped short of details, including whether Kerr would remain captain. Reaction from the Australian public, when the BBC spoke to people on Bondi Beach in Sydney on Wednesday, was more mixed. ""I think people would make mistakes,"" said one person. ""She's in the limelight and she has been a great role model for young girls. It's important for her to keep that, with everything she has done for female football in Australia."" ""She obviously let herself down,"" said another. ""I'm a bit surprised she has got away with it like she has. We'll see what comes from this for Chelsea and Australia I guess."" The not guilty verdict has not spared Kerr from criticism in the Australian media either. Erin Smith, football writer for the Australian newspaper, said Kerr's behaviour was ""unacceptable"" for someone in a prominent leadership role. ""Football Australia needs to take a hard-line stance and send a message to the millions of Matildas fans that behaviour like this will not be swept under the rug and forgotten about,"" she wrote on Wednesday. Alex Blair wrote for news.com.au that Kerr ""could be facing an even bigger mountain to climb after her dramatic legal saga"", and that she faced losing a chunk of her annual income - she earned a reported Aus$3.3m (£1.67m) in 2022 - if brands dropped her as a representative. Writing for The Guardian Australia, Kieran Pender described the trial as ""a Rorschach test, enabling observers to reach their own conclusions about the Matildas star well before a verdict was reached"". ""Even before the verdict, it was clear that things will not be the same for Kerr, or Australian football, moving forward,"" he wrote. ""The extent to which this incident tarnishes a glittering career, or is relegated to a footnote, remains to be seen."" Kerr remains a key figure for club and country, with both Chelsea and Australia keen to see her back on the pitch as soon as possible. Now 31, Kerr made her senior international debut aged just 15 and has scored 69 goals in 128 appearances for the Matildas. In 2019 she joined Chelsea, and was a key player in establishing them as the dominant WSL force under former manager Emma Hayes, winning five league titles. She finished third in the Ballon d'Or Feminin voting in 2021 and 2022, then second in 2023. A ""big-game player"", she scored five goals in three successive FA Cup finals between 2021 and 2023, all won by Chelsea. Kerr has not played since the end of 2023, suffering a serious knee injury during a winter training camp with Chelsea in January 2024. Chelsea confirmed she had been training on grass on Wednesday and her return to action could be imminent, with reports suggesting
, external
she will be fit to play for her club within a month. Australia interim coach Tom Sermanni is hopeful she will be available for the April internationals,

while she was part of Chelsea's winter training camp under new manager Bompastor at the start of this year."

Starc, 35, will not be sharing a reason for his decision and has asked for privacy.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c17ejwnywyno,Australian nurses suspended over 'vile' antisemitic video,2025-02-12T06:00:07.991Z,Simon Atkinson,"Two Australian nurses have been suspended after a video appeared to show them threatening to kill Israeli patients and boasting about refusing to treat them. The man and woman - both employees at a Sydney hospital - are now being investigated by police, officials in New South Wales (NSW) said. State Health Minister Ryan Park said that a ""thorough investigation"" would be carried out to make sure there had been ""no adverse [patient] outcomes"", but that a ""rapid"" examination of hospital records had not turned up anything unusual. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese condemned the video as ""sickening and shameful"" after it began circulating online. It comes less than a week after Australia passed tougher laws against hate crimes following a wave of high-profile antisemitic attacks. On Wednesday, NSW Police said that they believed they had ""identified the individuals involved"" in the video. The health minister said both had been stood down immediately, and promised that they would never work in the NSW healthcare system again. The video was shared on TikTok by content creator Max Veifer, who says he is from Israel. His account features conversations with people he encounters on the app Chatruletka - an anonymous online platform which pairs people randomly for a video chat. The footage, seen by the BBC, appears to have been recorded in a hospital. A man, who claims to be a doctor, tells Mr Veifer that he ""has beautiful eyes"" but adds ""I'm sorry you're Israeli"" before saying he sends Israelis to Jahannam - an Islamic place akin to hell. He goes on to make a throat-slitting gesture, before a woman comes on screen and says that ""one day"" Mr Veifer's ""time will come"" and that he will die, later adding that she won't treat Israelis. ""I won't treat them, I will kill them,"" she says. The video has been edited, emojis have been added, and some comments have been bleeped out - but authorities are not questioning its authenticity. Albanese described it as ""disgusting"" and ""vile"", writing on X: ""These antisemitic comments, driven by hate, have no place in our health system and no place anywhere in Australia. ""Individuals found to have committed criminal antisemitic acts will face the full force of our laws."" Park also apologised to the Jewish community, and said he wanted to reassure them that they could still expect ""first class"" health care in NSW. ""There is no place in our hospital and health system for this sort of view to ever, ever take place. There is no place for this sort of perspective in our society."" He added that staff at the hospital in the suburb of Bankstown were embarrassed and ashamed, but said it did not diminish the good work they did. In recent months, in incidents unconnected to the hospital video, there have been a series of arson and graffiti attacks involving homes, cars, and synagogues in Jewish areas across Australia, causing fear in the community. A caravan packed with power gel explosives that police warned had the potential to cause a ""mass casualty event"" was found in NSW in January, alongside a document with antisemitic sentiments and a list of Jewish targets in Sydney. The co-chief executive of the Executive Council of Australian Jewry Alex Ryvchin said the video served as a ""warning sign once again to all Australians about the evil that exists in our midst""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c626qwvekl1o,'Grease and rags' sewer fatberg halts Bryan Adams concert,2025-02-10T03:03:05.962Z,Hannah Ritchie,"A ""large"" sewer blockage caused by ""fat, grease and rags"" has forced the cancellation of a Bryan Adams concert in Australia on public health grounds. The Grammy Award winning artist was due to perform at the RAC Arena in Perth on Sunday, but the city's water corporation said a blocked main risked backing up the venue's toilets. Adams apologised to fans on social media - many of whom had lined up for hours only to be turned away - and thanked them for their ""patience and support"" before promising to try to reschedule the show. The concert promoter said the cancellation was ""bitterly disappointing"" and would provide ticketholders with a full refund. ""While every effort was made for the show to proceed, this matter was outside of the control of Bryan Adams, Frontier Touring and RAC Arena,"" it wrote in a statement. Perth's water corporation said the fatberg responsible for the disruption had already ""caused several wastewater overflows"" on the main road near the venue and urged the public to avoid direct contact with ""pooled water"" in the area. ""We apologise for the inconvenience this has caused and will provide further updates as required,"" it said in a post on Facebook, advising of the cancellation. Adams - who is known for his tracks such as Summer of '69 and Please Forgive Me - made his Australian debut in 1984 and has remained a beloved performer across the country ever since. ""I'm really sorry we couldn't make this happen tonight — I was so looking forward to seeing you all,"" he posted on social media on Sunday. The Canadian rock star is still due to play in Sydney, Brisbane, and Melbourne later this week. Found in sewers around the world, fatbergs are formed when fat, oil and grease solidify and bind with items such as rags, or wet wipes. They are known to cause serious blockages and environmental hazards. Last year, a fatberg weighing roughly the same as three double-decker buses was cleared from an east London sewer. And New York, Denver, Melbourne and Valencia have all found giant fatbergs blocking their waterways in recent years."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm21j341m31o,Woman's deepfake betrayal by close friend: 'Every moment turned into porn',2025-02-08T18:08:04.422Z,Tiffanie Turnbull,"Warning: Contains offensive language and descriptions of sexual violence It was a warm February night when an ominous message popped into Hannah Grundy's inbox in Sydney. ""I will just keep emailing because I think this is worthy of your attention,"" the anonymous sender wrote. Inside was a link, and a warning in bold: ""[This] contains disturbing material."" She hesitated for a moment, fearing it was a scam. The reality was so much worse. The link contained pages and pages of fake pornography featuring Hannah, alongside detailed rape fantasies and violent threats. ""You're tied up in them,"" she recalls. ""You look afraid. You've got tears in your eyes. You're in a cage."" Written in kitschy word art on some images was Hannah's full name. Her Instagram handle was posted, as was the suburb she lived in. She would later learn her phone number had also been given out. That email kicked off a saga Hannah likens to a movie. She was left to become her own detective, uncovering a sickening betrayal by someone close to her, and building a case which changed her life - and Australian legal standards. The web page was called ""The Destruction of Hannah"", and at the top of it was a poll where hundreds of people had voted on the vicious ways they wanted to abuse her. Below was a thread of more than 600 vile photos, with Hannah's face stitched on to them. Buried in between them were chilling threats. ""I'm closing in on this slut,"" the main poster said. ""I want to hide in her house and wait until she is alone, grab her from behind and... feel her struggle."" It's been three years now, but the 35-year-old school teacher has no trouble recalling the ""pure shock"" that coursed through when she and partner Kris Ventura, 33, opened the page. ""You immediately feel unsafe,"" Hannah tells me, eyes wide as she grips a mug of peppermint tea in her living room. Clicking through the website Kris had also found photos of their close friends, along with images depicting at least 60 other women, many also from Sydney. The couple quickly realised the pictures used to create the deepfakes were from the women's private social media accounts. And the penny dropped: this was someone they all knew. Desperate to find out who, Hannah and Kris spent hours at the kitchen table, identifying the women, searching their social media friends lists for a common link, and methodically building a dossier of evidence. Within four hours, they had a list of three potential suspects. On it, but immediately discounted, was their close friend from university Andrew Hayler. The trio had met while working at a campus bar, and the staff there quickly formed deep friendships. And Andy, as they called him - the supervisor - was the glue of the group. He was considerate and affable, Hannah says - the kind of guy who looked out for women in the bar and made sure his female friends got home safely after a night out. They all hung out regularly, went on holidays together, loved and trusted each other. ""I thought of him as a very close friend,"" Hannah says. ""We were just so sure that he was a good person."" But soon they'd whittled down the list to just one name: his. When Hannah woke the next morning and went to the police station, mingling with her shock and horror was a ""naive"" sliver of optimism. ""We thought they'd go grab him that afternoon,"" Kris says with a wry smile. Instead, Hannah says she was met with disdain. She recalls one New South Wales Police officer asking what she'd done to Andy. At one stage they suggested Hannah simply ask him to stop. Later, they pointed to a picture of her in a skimpy outfit and said ""you look cute in this one"", she says. New South Wales Police declined to comment to the BBC on the specifics of Hannah's case. But she says the way her complaint was handled made her feel like she was making ""a big deal out of nothing"". ""And for me, it felt quite life-changing,"" says Hannah. Any faith she still held that police would help quickly dwindled. Amid delays, she turned to Australia's eSafety Commissioner, but under its powers as a regulatory body it could only offer help in taking the content down. Desperate, the couple hired a lawyer and commissioned a digital forensics analyst to move things along. In the meantime, to avoid tipping Andy off and to keep themselves safe, they retreated inwards. ""The world for you just gets smaller. You don't speak to people. You don't really go out,"" Hannah says. Intense fear and loneliness filled the void instead. ""We'd already had to suspend complete belief to understand that he'd done these things, so [the idea of] him actually coming to try and rape you or hurt you isn't that much of a bigger stretch."" The couple installed cameras all around their house and set up location tracking on Hannah's devices. She began wearing a health watch 24/7, so someone would know if her heartbeat rose - or ceased. ""I stopped having the windows open because I was scared... maybe someone would come in,"" Hannah explains. ""We slept with a knife in both of our bedside tables because we just thought: 'What if?'"" Still feeling abandoned by police, Kris had taken on the burden of monitoring the site for the slightest sign of escalation towards Hannah and any of their friends - who, to protect the investigation, still did not know anything. Guilt ate at the pair: ""We had a constant battle about whether it was right to not tell them,"" Hannah says. At one point told the investigation had been suspended, Hannah and Kris forked out even more money for a detailed forensic report, and threatened to make a formal complaint to the police watchdog. All up, they spent over A$20,000 (£10,200; $12,400) trying to protect themselves and stop Andy. Finally a new detective was assigned and within two weeks police were raiding Andy's house. He admitted everything. Filled with relief, then dread, Hannah began calling her friends to break the news. ""My stomach just dropped,"" Jessica Stuart says, recalling the moment she learned what Andy had done to her photos. ""I felt really violated but… I don't think I fully comprehended."" For her, again, the sucker punch was that a friend who she loved like ""family"" was behind the crime. Andy had always appeared ""so unassuming"" and ""really thoughtful"" - someone she'd called for help through a difficult time. ""It's been really hard to reconcile that those two people are actually the same person."" The case was uncharted territory for Australia. For at least a decade, experts have warned advances in technology would lead to a wave of AI crimes. But authorities have been caught on the back foot, leaving deepfake victims - overwhelmingly women - vulnerable. At the time Andy was arrested in 2022, there was no offence for creating or sharing deepfake pornography in NSW, or anywhere else in Australia, and the country had never seen a case of this magnitude before. The 39-year-old was charged with using a carriage service to menace, harass or cause offence - a low-level catch-all offence for many internet crimes - and Hannah was warned to keep her expectations low. ""We were prepared to go to court and for him to get a slap on the wrist,"" she says. But she and the 25 other women who decided to be part of the case were determined Andy be held accountable. One after the other, several gave crushing statements at his sentencing hearing last year. ""You didn't just betray my friendship, but you shattered the sense of safety I used to take for granted,"" Jess told the court. ""The world feels unfamiliar and dangerous, I am constantly anxious, I have nightmares when I am able to sleep. ""Forming new friendships feels impossible, burdened by the constant question: 'Could this person be like you?'"" When it came time for Andy to apologise to the women he'd targeted, Jess and Hannah couldn't stomach being in the room. They walked out. ""There is nothing that he can say to me that makes it better, and I wanted him to know that,"" Hannah says. Andy told the court that creating the images had felt ""empowering"" as ""an outlet"" for a ""dark"" part of his psyche, but that he didn't think they would cause real harm. ""I have really done a terrible thing and I am so very sorry,"" he said. Judge Jane Culver was not convinced of his remorse, saying while there was ""some contrition"", he didn't seem to understand the clearly ""profound and ongoing"" suffering that his ""prolific"" and ""disturbing"" offending had caused. She sentenced Andy to nine years in jail - in what has been called a landmark decision. ""The gasp that went through the court... it was such a relief,"" Jess says. ""It was the first time I felt like we had actually been listened to."" Andy will be eligible for parole in December 2029, but has told the court he intends to challenge his sentence. Nicole Shackleton, a law expert who researches technology and gender, told the BBC the ""unprecedented"" case set a surprising, and significant, legal standard for future cases. The judge had recognised ""this wasn't merely something that happened online"" and that such behaviour was ""tied to offline violence against women"", said Dr Shackleton, from Melbourne's RMIT University. But Australia and other countries remain poor at regulating the use of AI and proactively investigating its misuse, experts like her argue. Australia has recently criminalised the creation and sharing of deepfake pornography at a national level. But many other countries have legislation accused of containing loopholes, or do not criminalise deepfake pornography at all. In the UK, sharing it is an offence, but creating or soliciting it is not - though this is about to change. And in the face of under-trained and under-resourced police forces, many victims like Hannah or private investigators - like the one who tipped her off - are left to be de facto detectives and regulators. In a statement, NSW Police said investigations into AI crimes are a challenging, ""resource and time intensive process"", and training has recently been beefed up ""with the goal that every officer... can respond to these types of crimes effectively"". The force also works with the eSafety Commissioner and tech companies to take down deepfake abuse, the statement added. eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant said removal of the distressing material is the top priority for most victim-survivors, and eSafety had ""an extremely high success rate in achieving it"". But eSafety does not have the punitive powers to pursue criminal investigations and penalties, she added in a statement to the BBC. ""You can have whatever laws you like, [but] if you have a police force that are incompetent..."" Kris says, trailing off. ""We're obviously angry at Andy. But it is also disgusting that the only way you get justice with something like this is if you're two people in your 30s that can afford to bully the police."" They're determined for things to be different for future victims. In the past six months alone, two schoolboys in separate cases in NSW and Victoria have been reported to police for allegedly creating mass deepfake nudes of their classmates. After several years of hell, Hannah is also trying to move on. But Andy's looming appeal threatens the hard work she's done to rebuild her life and mental health. Knees at her chest and feet tucked under her on the couch, she says Andy got the sentence he deserved. ""Because for me, and for the other girls, it is forever… they will always be on the internet,"" she says. She still pays for a service which scours the web for the pictures, and she worries about future friends, employers, students - her own children - finding them. One of her biggest fears is that her best memories will never be reclaimed. ""You post things on Facebook and Instagram because they're the happiest moments of your life. You get a dog, you buy a house, you get engaged and you post a photo. ""He had turned every single one of those moments for us into porn. And so when you see that photo… well, now I see myself getting raped."" If you've been affected by the issues in this story, help and support is available via the BBC Action Line"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgmypx0wldro,More than 100 venomous snakes found in Sydney yard,2025-02-07T07:59:01.918Z,Iris Zeng,"Australian reptile handlers say they have been stunned to rescue 102 venomous snakes from a backyard mulch pile in Sydney. Cory Kerewaro said his business was initially called to rescue ""a bunch"" of the reptiles after one was reported to have bitten a dog at the property. When his colleague arrived, he discovered 40 red-bellied black snakes - four of which gave birth to more live young once he had placed them in a removal bag. Red-bellied black snakes are one of the most common venomous species in Australia but have not caused any human deaths on record. The five adult and 97 baby snakes are currently under quarantine and will be released into a national park once the weather cools. Mr Kerewaro said it was as record haul for the snake handlers, who normally catch between five and 15 reptiles per day. He said he recalls colleague Dylan Cooper calling him within 15 minutes to say: ""Mate, I'm going to be here a while. It's a pretty big pile... I'm already over 15 snakes!"" ""I thought he was stitching me up."" The dog was ""alive and well"" after the incident which happened on Boxing Day, he added. Female red-bellied black snakes often gather in small groups when they are ready to give birth, possibly to protect against predators, according to Mr Kerewaro. They are the only snake of their genus to give live birth, the Australian Museum says on its website. The species is considered to be shy, and bites - though uncommon - can cause swelling, nausea and diarrhoea. Snake catchers are required by law to release the animals close to where they were found. But given the size this discovery, the catchers have been given permission to release the snakes into a national park away from human interactions."

Stoinis, 35, played six matches in Australia's 2023 World Cup win and, despite playing just one ODI since, was in line to feature in the upcoming Champions Trophy in place of the injured Cameron Green. ""This wasn't an easy decision but I believe it's the right time for me to step away from ODIs and fully focus on the next chapter of my career,"" Stoinis said. ""I've got a fantastic relationship with Ron [coach Andrew McDonald] and I've hugely appreciated his support. ""I'll be cheering the boys on in Pakistan."" The retirement is further disruption to Australia's Champions Trophy preparation. Captain Pat Cummins, fellow bowler Josh Hazlewood and all-rounder and vice-captain Mitchell Marsh have all been ruled out with injury. Australia have until 12 February to finalise their squad. Steve Smith and Travis Head are being considered as captaincy options for the tournament which begins on 19 February. Leg-spinner Tanveer Sangha, all-rounders Sean Abbott and Cooper Connolly, batter Jake Fraser-McGurk, and left-armers Ben Dwarshuis and Spencer Johnson, have been added to the squad for two ODIs against Sri Lanka next week. Stoinis, who will continue to be available for T20s for Australia, played 71 ODIs after making his debut in 2015. He scored 1,495 runs at an average of 26.69 with a high score of 146 not out against New Zealand in 2017 - his only international century. He has also taken 48 wickets. ""Playing ODI cricket for Australia has been an incredible journey, and I'm grateful for every moment I've had in the green and gold,"" Stoinis said. ""Representing my country at the highest level is something I'll always cherish."""

The new laws were passed following a wave of high-profile antisemitic attacks which have become a major topic of debate in the country. The amendments have been described by the government as the ""toughest laws Australia has ever had against hate crimes"". But critics say that the governing Labor Party is caving to opposition demands and going against its own policy of opposing mandatory jail sentences. Under the amendments, displaying hate symbols or performing a Nazi salute is now punishable with at least one year in prison. Other penalties include a minimum of three years for financing terrorism and six years for committing or planning terrorist acts. There have been several attacks on Jewish targets in Australia in recent months. Last week authorities in Sydney found a caravan containing explosives and an antisemitic note. The discovery came just a week after a childcare centre near a Jewish school and synagogue in Sydney was set on fire and antisemitic graffiti was seen on one of its walls. In December, a synagogue in Melbourne was set alight with worshippers inside. No-one was seriously hurt in the incident, which sent shockwaves through the country. Former Labor senator Kim Carr criticised the party for what he said was a ""clear breach of the Labor party national platform"". Labor opposes mandatory sentences on the grounds that such penalties do not reduce crime, undermine the courts' independence and are often discriminatory in practice. But opposition parties did not rush to welcome the new amendments either, accusing Labor of dragging its feet. ""The parliament is not acting today because of the decisiveness of the Labor Party,"" Liberal senator James Paterson told reporters in Canberra. ""The prime minister has been dragged kicking and screaming to finally introduce tough legislation that will ensure there are real penalties for this behaviour."" Performing the Nazi salute and displaying Nazi symbols such as the swastika, have been banned since January 2024 and carry up to one year in jail. The amendments on Thursday make the jail term mandatory. ""This is not about politics,"" Home Affairs minister Tony Burke said on Wednesday night as the amendments were introduced to parliament. ""This is about whether the Australian Parliament believes it's acceptable to advocate, threaten or commit violence against another person because of who they are, who they pray to or who they love."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9l1w5zlgdo,Scientists produce first kangaroo embryo using IVF,2025-02-06T03:10:04.346Z,Hannah Ritchie,"Australian scientists have produced the world's first kangaroo embryo through in vitro fertilisation (IVF), a breakthrough they say could help save other species from extinction. Using specimens from eastern grey kangaroos, the researchers successfully injected a single sperm cell into an egg, but said achieving a live birth would require more work and ""technical advancements"". The feat provides important insights into marsupial breeding and could aid efforts to improve the genetic diversity of endangered species such as the koala, Tasmanian devil, northern hairy-nosed wombat and Leadbeater's possum, lead researcher Andres Gambini said. Australia houses the largest variety of marsupial mammals, but it also has the highest rate of mammal extinctions. The University of Queensland experiment looked at the growth of kangaroo eggs and sperm in a laboratory setting before creating embryos using a method known as intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI). The technique, which is already used on humans and some domestic animals, was tried on eastern grey kangaroos that had died. The species was selected because it is not endangered and has existing high populations. Despite how iconic marsupial species are in Australia and the crucial role they play in its biodiversity, studies into their tissues have been limited, scientists say. ""We are now refining techniques to collect, culture and preserve marsupial eggs and sperm,"" said Dr Gambini, adding that such methods would play a crucial role in safeguarding ""the genetic material of these unique and precious animals"". IVF is being used as a tool to try and preserve endangered species the world over. Last year, scientists achieved the world's first IVF rhino pregnancy, successfully transferring a lab-created rhino embryo into a surrogate mother in Kenya. In 2018, IVF was also used to create the world's first donkey embryo."
https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/cx2j4xvqvjpo,Australia's Cummins set to miss Champions Trophy,2025-02-05T10:00:23.494Z,,"Australia captain Pat Cummins is ""hugely unlikely"" to be fit for the Champions Trophy, says coach Andrew McDonald. Fast bowler Cummins, 31, is absent from the ongoing Test series in Sri Lanka because of the birth of his second child, but also has an ankle problem. Fellow paceman Josh Hazlewood, who has been sidelined with calf and side issues and was named in Australia's preliminary squad alongside Cummins, is also a doubt. ""Patty is hugely unlikely, which is a bit of shame, and we've also got Josh Hazlewood, who is battling [to be fit] at the moment,"" McDonald told radio station SEN. ""So that medical information will land over the next couple of days and we'll be able to shore that up and let everyone know the direction."" Cummins' absence would leave 50-over world champions Australia with a decision to make over the captaincy, with all-rounder and vice-captain Mitchell Marsh already out with a back issue. McDonald said Steve Smith, who is currently leading in Cummins' absence in Sri Lanka and has captained Australia in 59 one-day internationals, and fellow batter Travis Head are the two options being considered. Head has never been captain in ODIs but has been in charge for one T20 - a defeat by England in Cardiff last year. ""Pat Cummins hasn't been able to resume any type of bowling so he's heavily unlikely, so that would mean that we do need a captain,"" McDonald said. ""They'll be the two that we look at for that leadership post."" The Champions Trophy, held in Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, begins on 19 February. Australia are in a group with England, Afghanistan and South Africa and meet England in their opening fixture on 22 February. Teams have until Wednesday, 12 February to make changes to their preliminary squads. Left-armer Mitchell Starc and seamer Nathan Ellis are currently the only fit quick bowlers in Australia's squad. Seamer Sean Abbott, left-armer Spencer Johnson and quick Lance Morris were part of the squad beaten 2-1 at home by Pakistan in Australia's most recent ODI series."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgpvrgezp3o,Second woman confirmed dead in Australia's floods,2025-02-04T10:58:56.517Z,Simon Atkinson,"A second woman is confirmed to have died in flooding which has inflicted ""incredible"" devastation on communities in northern Australia. Police said the 82-year-old woman's body was found in a cane paddock in Queensland on Tuesday, two days after a 63-year-old woman died when a dinghy she was in overturned during a rescue attempt. The region has been inundated since Saturday, with parts of northern Queensland seeing nearly 2m (6.5 ft) of rain. By Tuesday, conditions were starting to ease - although Queensland Premier David Crisafulli warned it was still ""a disaster that's going to test the resolve of people"" during an interview with broadcaster ABC. He described the devastation as ""incredible"", but noted weather conditions had been ""really kind"" in recent hours. Thousands had begun to return to their homes. In Townsville, locals woke on Tuesday to grey skies and drizzle, and the news that predicted flooding levels had not materialised there. It was a stark contrast to the intense downpours which have battered the region over the past few days. ""We believe that the danger has passed,"" Townsville Local Disaster Management Group chair Andrew Robinson told reporters. Pointing to earlier forecasts which had suggested up to 2,000 Townsville homes could have faced flood risks, Crisafulli said that ""the city had dodged a bullet"". Local resident Jo Berry told the BBC she and her family were among those returning home on Tuesday, after spending a sleepless night monitoring the rainfall. ""People talk about PTSD when it rains here and I totally understand,"" says Ms Berry, formerly from Leicester in the UK. ""We've been in the house here for over 20 years, and have been through a few cyclone events and the 2019 flooding so it is not our first rodeo,"" she adds, referring to a flooding disaster which caused A$1.24bn (£620m; $770m) in damage. On Monday night, other local residents told the BBC they were ""on a knife edge"" as they waited to see whether their houses would survive. But further north in the state, power outages and damaged roads have made it difficult to assess the full extent of the destruction in towns such as Ingham and Cardwell. Crisafulli said early reports suggested the damage was ""quite frankly incredible"" and that Ingham, which is almost entirely without electricity, ""remains the biggest challenge"". ""There are people who have been inundated at home, in their businesses and in their farms,"" he told reporters on Tuesday. Footage published in local media showed long lines at the town's supermarket as people waited for critical supplies. Crisafulli said that amid the blackout the local hospital was operating as normal, and a petrol station was open. The flooding has caused damage to the area's homes, crops and coastline, local MP Nick Dametto said in a video posted online. ""The inundation is something that I have never seen before,"" he said. Home to fewer than 5,000 people, Ingham was already reeling after the 63-year-old woman died when a State Emergency Service (SES) dinghy capsized during a rescue attempt on Sunday. The second woman's body was found on Tuesday just north of Ingham after a neighbour raised the alarm. She was last seen on Monday night in a house, Queensland Police said in a statement. More than 8,000 properties remain without power across northern Queensland, according to the state's energy provider, and the partial collapse of a critical highway continues to hinder efforts to assist some of the hardest-hit areas. Crisafulli said the recovery effort would ""take some time"" and that the priority in the coming hours would be to work with the army to get power generators to isolated communities and ""bring them back online"". He added that federal funding would help reconstruct the battered Bruce Highway - the state's main thoroughfare which stretches 1,673km (1,039 miles) from the south. Located in the tropics, northern Queensland is vulnerable to destructive cyclones, storms, and flooding. Speaking to the BBC in Townsville, Scott Heron, a local resident and climate expert, said the latest disaster was not unexpected. ""For a long time, climate scientists have been clear that extreme weather events will become more extreme, and we are seeing that,"" said Prof Heron , who works at James Cook University and is the Unesco Chair on Climate Vulnerability of Heritage. Prof Heron urged politicians to consider this as they planned recovery and rebuilding efforts, such as to the Bruce Highway. It would be ""wasting public money"" if infrastructure planning, particularly for long-term projects including roads and bridges, did not ""incorporate changing threats due to climate change"", he said.

In the arm of the seat, a drinks pocket holds an icy bottle of beer. But on the ground next to him, a pile of half a dozen sandbags, ready to go. Mr Duric lives across the street from the Ross River – overflowing and fast-moving – in Idalia, one of six suburbs labelled ""black zones"" in Townsville, one of the areas hardest hit by a flooding emergency in Queensland state in Australia. Authorities have urged people living in those spots to leave. They were given a deadline of noon on Sunday, but like plenty of others, Mr Duric has opted to stay put. ""We've only been here 12 months, so I've relied on a lot of information from people around us,"" he says. ""We were thinking about moving out, but we have pets, we've got nowhere to go so have decided to follow the neighbour's advice and stay. ""We haven't panicked but we are prepared. Let's hope for the best and hope we don't have to use the sand bags."" The city has been inundated with more than 600mm (23.6in) of rain in the past week. Other parts of the state of Queensland have seen almost 1.3m of rain since Saturday, causing rivers and reservoirs to overflow, with officials suggesting as many as 2,000 homes could be inundated before the water reached its peak. But by late Monday afternoon, both the cloud and the mood had lifted. The first break in the rain for days bringing smiles, and curiosity, as locals headed out to inspect the waterways. For Daniel Watts, walking the dog with his family, there's a glimmer of optimism that their home will not suffer the same fate as during floods here six years ago – when water rose 1.5 metres and his property had to be gutted. ""It's been on a knife edge as to whether our house will get inundated or not, so there's been quite a bit of anxiety,"" he told the BBC. ""Luckily, it hasn't yet. And at this stage, the dam levels are retreating, which is good. It's still wait and see, though. It wouldn't take much."" The Townsville Disaster Management Group expects the Ross River to peak between 07:00 and 08:00 on Tuesday (21:00 to 22:00GMT). ""We're not quite out of the woods yet,"" Queensland state Premier David Crisafulli told ABC News. But Mr Watts is taking comfort from Monday's easing weather – a contrast to 2019 when, he says, the rain ""just did not stop"". ""Having a bit of a reprieve is from the rain is really good,"" he said. ""It gives everything just time. It gives time for the river and the dam, but we'll see. It's not over."""

Paramedics responded to reports of a ""serious shark bite incident"" at Woorim Beach, just north of Brisbane, around 16:45 local time (06:45 GMT) on Monday, Queensland Ambulance Service wrote on X. Police confirmed that the girl had suffered life-threatening injuries and died shortly after 17:00. Australian media reports that she was 17 years old. The waters around the beach are home to many sharks, but the attack occurred close to shore in the popular surfing spot, which has measures to protect against sharks. Police confirmed the girl had been swimming in the waters off Bribie Island - just off the mainland, on which Woorim Beach sits - when she was attacked by the shark, the species of which has not been identified. The Queensland Ambulance Service confirmed the victim suffered life-threatening injuries to her upper body. She was bitten on the arm around 100m from shore, Australian media reports. Christopher Potter arrived at the beach shortly after the attack happened. He told ABC News: ""There are a lot of swimming groups that swim along here, morning and afternoon. ""It's known there are a lot of sharks around Bribie, but this close to shore, it's still a shock."" The waters near the beach are protected with drumlines - barrels anchored to the sea floor which have baited hooks to catch sharks that get too close. Target species caught in these are then euthanised, while other species are relocated and released. Police said they will prepare a report on Monday's incident for the coroner. It is the second shark fatality in Australia's waters this year, after surfer Lance Appleby was killed off the coast of South Australia on 2 January. The last fatal attack in the Greater Brisbane area came in 2006, when 21-year-old Sarah Whiley was killed while swimming with friends. Shark attacks in Queensland ""happen rarely and most shark species do not pose a risk to people"", according to the state government's website."

The flooding has claimed a woman's life and caused havoc across the state's north, with residents in Townsville, Ingham, and Cardwell among the hardest hit. ""Record"" downpours are set to continue, authorities say, with parts of the region already experiencing almost 1.3m (4.2ft) of rain since Saturday, causing rivers and reservoirs to overflow. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese - who was briefed about the response efforts on Monday - said that the disaster had brought out ""the best of Australians"". ""I've seen Australians helping one another in their time of need,"" he wrote on X, adding that the ""threat from floodwaters"" would persist in affected areas for days. Efforts to assist the hardest-hit areas have been hindered by flood damage to parts of the Bruce Highway - the main thoroughfare stretching 1,673km (1039 miles) from the state's south. This included the partial collapse of a bridge that could add an extra 700km to driving routes and slow down the delivery of critical supplies, the Queensland Trucking Association told the ABC. Queensland's Premier David Crisafulli offered his condolences to the ""tight-knit"" town of Ingham, after a 63-year-old woman died when a State Emergency Service (SES) dinghy capsized during a rescue attempt on Sunday. ""We are deeply sorry for their loss,"" he told reporters on Monday. Crisafulli also urged all residents located in the so-called ""black-zone"" of the floods - which includes six Townsville suburbs - to not return home, due to the ongoing threat posed by the nearby Ross River. Australia's Bureau of Meteorology said the area had received six months of rainfall in three days. About 2,000 homes could be inundated as water levels rise before their expected peak on Tuesday, the Townsville Local Disaster Management Group warned. Many homes have already been flooded. One Ingham resident who lives with her elderly mother told the Townsville Bulletin that she had waited seven hours for emergency services to help them evacuate after their property was affected. ""I was crying, I was hysterical. Someone even hung up on me when I called [emergency number] triple-0, saying: 'We're busy,'"" she said. Though rainfall is now easing, major flood warnings remain in place for communities along several rivers. Crisafulli has warned that Ingham could be on track to experience its worst flooding in 60 years if the Herbert river surpasses a peak of 15.2m. Emergency responders have continued working around the clock, with the SES receiving 480 calls for help on Sunday night and performing 11 ""swift water"" rescues. Widespread power outages continue to be reported, making it impossible for some communities to call for assistance. SES Deputy Commissioner Shane Chelepy urged people to stay vigilant and check on their neighbours when possible. He added that some 400 people were now being housed in evacuation centres across Townsville, Ingham, and Cardwell. Authorities have also asked locals to be on the lookout for crocodiles, saying that they could be lurking in streams away from their usual habitats. Located in the tropics, north Queensland is vulnerable to destructive cyclones, storms, and flooding. But climate scientists have warned that warmer oceans and a hotter planet are creating the conditions for more intense and frequent extreme rainfall events."

Authorities say waters will continue to rise and have warned of a ""dangerous and life-threatening"" situation, with parts of the region recording almost 1.3m (4.2ft) of rain since Saturday. ""Record"" downpours are set to continue into Monday, according to Queensland's Premier David Crisafulli. Meteorologists say these could be the worst floods in the region in more than 60 years. Crisafulli said conditions were unlike anything northern Queensland had experienced ""for a long time"". ""It's not just the intensity, but it's also the longevity of it,"" he told Australian broadcaster ABC. The woman who died was onboard a State Emergency Service (SES) dinghy which hit a tree and capsized in the town of Ingham. It is understood she was a member of the public who was being rescued at the time, and was not an emergency worker. The other five people on board were able to get to safety. An investigation has been launched. Meanwhile, three people were rescued from the roof of a house in Cardwell, about halfway between Cairns and Townsville. Video has emerged showing a man clinging to a pole in Ingham after his vehicle was washed away - and being taken to safety by locals in a boat. The Townsville Local Disaster Management Group says that 2,000 homes in the city may be inundated - some up to the second floor - as river levels rise. Thousands of people across six Townsville suburbs were told to leave their homes by midday on Sunday, but officials say about 10% of residents had opted to stay. The same areas were severely hit during 2019 flooding. Premier Crisafulli urged people to heed the warnings, saying: ""In the end, houses and cars and furniture, that can all be replaced. Your family can't"". On Sunday night local time a new evacuation centre was being opened - as others reached capacity. Parts of the road on a major highway collapsed, hampering efforts to get rescue teams and sandbags to the worst-hit areas. Meanwhile supermarkets had run out of fresh food, and thousands of homes were without power, including in Ingham and the Indigenous community of Palm Island. And there is a warning for locals to watch for crocodiles lurking in floodwaters away from their usual habitats. Sitting in the tropics, north Queensland is prone to destructive cyclones, storms and flooding.

The explosives could have caused a 40m-wide blast and ""significant damage,"" police said on Wednesday, adding that the threat was contained. A note was found in the caravan that displayed antisemitic messages, investigators said. ""This is the discovery of a potential mass casualty event,"" New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said.  New South Wales Police Deputy Commissioner David Hudson told a news conference that the caravan was discovered on 19 January in Dural, a suburb of north-west Sydney. The investigation became public on Wednesday after details of it were leaked to the media. There was ""some indication that the explosives might be used in some form of antisemitic attack,"" Mr Hudson said, but he wouldn't be drawn on the possible target. He said officers had ""mitigated the risk as much as possible"" but stressed: ""I'm not saying it's been eliminated. I'm saying it's been mitigated."" ""That's one of the reasons we're talking today, for members of the public to be vigilant in relation to what they see and what they hear in relation to antisemitism in our community."" An investigation involving the Australian Federal Police (AFP) has been launched. On Thursday, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese told ABC Radio Sydney the threat was ""clearly designed to harm people"" and ""create fear in the community"". He said he agreed with Premier Chris Minns in describing it as ""terrorism"". It has not yet been designated as terrorism by NSW Police. Earlier, Albanese said that New South Wales Police had ""people in custody"" and was working with the AFP taskforce investigating antisemitic crimes called Special Operation Avalite. Minns said the threat would be ""met with the full resources of the government"". The discovery follows a spate of antisemitic attacks in Australia in recent months. On Thursday, police said a Jewish school in Sydney's eastern suburbs had been vandalised with antisemitic graffiti. In December, worshippers were forced to flee as Melbourne's Adass Israel synagogue was set on fire. Earlier this month, a childcare centre in Sydney was set alight and sprayed with antisemitic messages. Additional reporting by Iris Zeng in Sydney"

Elizabeth Struhs died at home in 2022 from diabetic ketoacidosis, which causes a dangerous build-up of ketones - a type of acid - and blood sugar spikes. The court heard that Elizabeth's treatment was withheld because the group, known as the Saints, opposed medical care, believing God would heal her. Her father Jason Struhs and the group's leader Brendan Stevens were on trial for murder but convicted of the lesser charge of manslaughter. Twelve other members, including Elizabeth's mother and brother, were also convicted of manslaughter. All had pleaded not guilty. When handing down his almost 500-page verdict on Wednesday, Justice Martin Burns said that although it was clear Elizabeth's parents and ""every member of the church including all other accused"" had adored her, their actions had resulted in her death. ""It cannot be doubted that Elizabeth was lovingly cared for in almost every way,"" he said. ""However, due to a singular belief in the healing power of God… she was deprived of the one thing that would most definitely have kept her alive."" The Saints are not affiliated with an established church in Australia and have roughly two dozen members from three families. The judge-alone trial in the Supreme Court of Queensland began in July last year and lasted several months. Prosecutors called 60 witnesses and painted a picture of an ""intelligent"" child who suffered greatly in her final days. ""She was described as speaking little, needing help going to the toilet, and being incontinent,"" prosecutor Caroline Marco said, adding that the girl would have endured vomiting, extreme lethargy, and a loss of consciousness. The congregation, meanwhile, had prayed and sung for Elizabeth, whose health deteriorated as she lay on a mattress at her home in Toowoomba, about 125km (78 miles) west of Brisbane. No effort was made to call a doctor, and authorities were not notified until 36 hours after her death, as the group believed she could be brought back to life, the court heard. The 14 defendants, aged between 22 and 67, represented themselves at trial, having all refused legal representation or to enter pleas. The court was required to enter not guilty pleas on their behalf. Most had been charged because they had either counselled or aided her father in his decision to withhold Elizabeth's insulin, the court heard. Prosecutors said that Jason Struhs, 53, had converted to the church much later than his wife Kerrie Struhs, 49, and that he had previously supported giving Elizabeth medicine. They argued he changed his mind after being baptised into the group and that ultimately he knew the decision would end his daughter's life. Speaking through tears when it was his turn to take the stand at trial, Jason Struhs said that he and Elizabeth had agreed to ""stop the insulin"" together, and that he still believed his daughter would be resurrected. ""Elizabeth is only sleeping, and I will see her again,"" he told the court. Stevens, 63, defended the group's actions as faith-based and described the trial as an act of ""religious persecution"". He said that the group was within its ""rights to believe in the word of God completely"" and that their decision not to enter pleas was because the congregation had ""no intention of fighting"" the case by using law. Elizabeth's sister Jayde Struhs told the trial she had left the Saints and fled her family home at 16, after coming out as gay, and was now estranged from them. She and other witnesses described the congregation as having increasingly strict views, including that mainstream healthcare should be shunned and that both Christmas and Easter were ""pagan"" or ungodly festivals. The court also heard that Elizabeth's life had been in danger in 2019 when she was admitted to hospital in a diabetic coma weighing just 15kg (2st 5lb), after having become too weak to walk. She was then diagnosed with type 1 diabetes, and her family was told she would need daily insulin injections. Both parents were charged over that incident - however Jason Struhs testified against his wife and received a more lenient sentence. At the time, he said his wife - who had been a member of the Saints for years - did not believe in providing their kids with medical treatment for religious reasons. He also openly expressed regret for having ""let his daughter down"". The court heard he later helped provide her with insulin for a period while his wife was in jail, but that he then faced pressure from other members of the religious group to stop doing so. Giving his verdict, Justice Burns said that Jason Struhs and Stevens couldn't be convicted of murder because prosecutors had not proved beyond a reasonable doubt that the pair had intended to kill or cause grievous bodily harm to Elizabeth. But all 14 defendants were guilty of manslaughter, he ruled, because they were jointly involved in a crime that resulted in her death. Jayde Struhs said that while she was pleased with the verdict, the ""system had failed"" her sister. ""We are only here today because more wasn't done sooner to protect her or remove her from an incredibly unsafe situation in her own home,"" she said in a statement outside court. The group is expected to be sentenced next month. Toowoomba has long had a ""colourful array of sectarian Christian groups and independent churches of various kinds"", says Bernard Doherty, who studies new religious movements. ""The Saints appear to be one of these small independent churches which form around a few families,"" he told the BBC, adding that little is known about the close-knit congregation. Jayde Struhs said the Saints had attended the Revival Centres International church in Brisbane, but they broke away after Stevens failed to become a pastor there. They then formed their own parish and held sermons at his house multiple times a week, she said."

It is the second time in 12 months that the statue in Sydney has been vandalised. Australia Day is a national holiday that is held each year on 26 January - the anniversary of Britain's First Fleet landing at Sydney Cove in 1788. Many Indigenous Australians say the date causes them pain. The local council in Randwick - the suburb where the statue is located - described the vandalism as ""a disservice to the community and a disservice to reconciliation"". Councillor Carolyn Martin told Sydney radio station 2GB that the vandals had knocked off one hand and parts of the face and nose. The statue - which was first unveiled in 1874 - was previously targeted in February last year, when it was covered with red paint and had parts of its sandstone damaged. Works to repair and restore it were completed a month later. There are several Captain Cook statues across Australia, and others have also been vandalised on or around 26 January. In 2024, one in Melbourne was cut down on the eve of the holiday, while its plinth was spray-painted with the words ""the colony will fall"". Two years earlier the same statue had been splashed with red paint, while in 2018 it was graffitied with the words ""no pride"" and had an Aboriginal flag placed next to it. Cook charted Australia's east coast in 1770, laying the groundwork for the later decision to send the First Fleet, which was led by Captain Arthur Phillip. Australia Day is a contentious holiday for some, particularly among those in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities who view it as a reminder of the dispossession and displacement of their people. To many Australians though, it is celebrated as a day of nation-building and achievement. Polling suggests a majority of people are supportive of keeping the holiday, despite suggestions it should be changed to a different date."

The titan arum plant, housed in the Royal Botanic Gardens of Sydney, blooms only once every few years for just 24 hours. Affectionately dubbed Putricia, it will release a smell described as ""wet socks, hot cat food, or rotting possum flesh"". The long wait to see Putricia fully unfurl has spawned jokes and even a unique lingo in the livestream's chat, with thousands commenting ""WWTF"", or ""We Watch the Flower"". The livestream attracted more than 8,000 simultaneous viewers on Thursday, doubling within hours as the plant's appearance slowly changed. John Siemon, director of horticulture and living collections at the gardens, compared the spectacle to Sydney's 2000 Olympics, saying ""we've had 15,000 people come through the gates before it [the flower] even opened"". ""This specimen is around 10 years old. We acquired it from our colleagues in LA Botanic Garden at the age of three, and we've been nurturing it for the last seven years,"" he told the BBC's Newsday programme. ""[We're] incredibly excited to have our first bloom in 15 years."" After days of inaction, the view on the livestream markedly changed on Thursday as Putricia, comfortably ensconced behind a red velvet rope, began to open up. As she continues to bloom, viewers can expect to see Putricia unfold a vibrant maroon or crimson skirt, known as a spathe, around her spadix which is the large spike in the middle of the plant. The gardens has said it is ""hard to predict exactly when"" Putricia will bloom, but that has not stopped the thousands gathered online. ""I'm back again to see how Putricia is going and I can see she's still taking her time like the queen she is, fair play,"" wrote one commenter. ""This is the slowest burlesque ever,"" said another. Yet another person wrote: ""Overnight I watched, fell asleep, awoke, watched, fell asleep. I am weak, but Putricia is strong. WWTF."" Other popular acronyms among viewers are WDNRP (We Do Not Rush Putricia) and BBTB (Blessed Be The Bloom). The plant can only be found in the rainforests of Sumatra, Indonesia, where it is known as bunga bangkai - or ""corpse flower"" in Indonesian. Its scientific name is Amorphophallus titanum, which is derived from Ancient Greek and means ""giant misshapen penis"". When in bloom, the plant's long yellow spadix emits a strong odour, often compared to the smell of decaying flesh, to trick pollinators into landing on what they think is rotten meat so they can move pollen between male and female specimens. It has the world's largest flowering structure, as it can grow up to 3m (10 feet) tall and weigh up to 150kg. The plant contains several hundred flowers in the base of its spadix. It is endangered in the wild due to deforestation and land degradation. Putricia is one of several titan arums in Sydney's Royal Botanic Gardens, which last saw one bloom 15 years ago. But there have been other corpse flower blooms across Australia in recent years, including Melbourne and Adelaide's botanic gardens, each time attracting thousands of curious visitors keen on having a whiff. There are also a few housed in Kew Gardens in London, where one bloomed in June last year. The titan arum first flowered outside of Sumatra in 1889 in Kew."

Mittens, an eight-year-old Maine Coon, was booked to travel from Christchurch to Melbourne on 12 January - but her cage was left in the Air New Zealand aircraft's cargo hold. After waiting for three hours for Mittens at Melbourne airport, owner Margo Neas was told by ground staff the plane had already returned to New Zealand with her pet. During that flight the heating was turned on to keep the cat comfortable, Ms Neas said. The pet - who had lost weight but was otherwise unharmed - was later flown again to Melbourne to reunite with her owner. Speaking to NBC on Wednesday, Ms Neas said she and her son had been informed about the mishap by airport ground staff in Melbourne. ""They said: 'Look, we have located your cat - but it's actually on the return flight to Christchurch...' ""And I said: 'When did you discover that the cat wasn't taken off the plane?' And they said: 'We've only just discovered now.' And I said: 'How can this happen?'"" Ms Neas said she was told that the pilot had already been alerted to turn the heating on in the cargo hold where the temperature could be as low as 7C. Air New Zealand is still looking into how Mittens was forgotten, but reports say a stowed wheelchair may have obscured a baggage handler's view of her cage. The airline has apologised for the distress caused and promised to reimburse all travel costs. The company does not accept direct animal bookings from the public for international flights, so passengers must book via approved pet carrier firms. Ms Neas said she had been relieved to be finally reunited with Mittens. ""She basically just ran into my arms and just snuggled up in here and just did the biggest cuddles of all time,"" she was quoted as saying by the AP news agency on Wednesday. ""It was just such a relief."" Ms Neas, who had earlier decided to relocate to Australia, added: ""It was not a great start to our new life in Melbourne because we didn't have the family, we weren't complete."" The one-way flight time between Christchurch and Melbourne usually takes less than four hours."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8057j0mz5mo,"Antisemitic crimes may be funded overseas, say Australian police",2025-01-21T23:24:48.922Z,Kathryn Armstrong and Tiffanie Turnbull,"Australia's federal police have said they are investigating whether ""overseas actors or individuals"" are paying local criminals to carry out antisemitic crimes in the country. There has been a spate of such incidents in recent months, the latest of which saw a childcare centre in Sydney set alight and sprayed with anti-Jewish graffiti. No-one was injured. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese called a snap cabinet meeting in response, where officials agreed to set up a national database to track antisemitic incidents. Thus far, the federal police taskforce, set up in December to investigate such incidents, received more than 166 reports of antisemitic crimes. Albanese said it appeared some of the crimes were ""being perpetrated by people who don't have a particular issue, aren't motivated by an ideology, but are paid actors"". ""Now, it's unclear who or where the payments are coming from,"" he told reporters on Wednesday. Australian Federal Police (AFP) Commissioner Reece Kershaw said it was possible that cryptocurrencies - which can take longer to identify - had been used. He added that police were also investigating whether young people were carrying out these crimes and whether they had been radicalised online. However, Mr Kershaw cautioned, ""intelligence is not the same as evidence"" and more charges were expected soon. Last week, a man from Sydney became the first person to be charged by the federal taskforce, dubbed Special Operation Avalite, over alleged death threats he made towards a Jewish organisation. Albanese said Tuesday's incident at a childcare centre in the eastern Sydney suburb of Maroubra was ""as cowardly as it is disgusting"" and described it as a ""hate crime"". ""This was an attack targeted at the Jewish community. And it is a crime that concerns us all because it is also an attack on the nation and society we have built together,"" he wrote on social media. Israel's deputy foreign minister told the ABC that Australia's government had been ""inflaming"" problems in the local community by not clamping down harder on antisemitic crimes. But Albanese on Wednesday said his government had ""acted from day one"" to protect Australia's Jewish community, and criticised those seeking to make it a ""political issue"". The Jewish Council of Australia, which was set up last year in opposition to antisemitism, said that it ""strongly condemns"" this and all such incidents. ""These acts underscore the urgent need for cooperation, education and community dialogue to combat prejudice and promote understanding,"" it said in a statement. Most of the recent incidents have taken place in Sydney and have involved antisemitic graffiti, arson and vandalism of buildings including synagogues. New South Wales has set up its own state-level taskforce to address these incidents and more than 35 people have been charged so far with antisemitism-related offences. These include a 33-year-old man who was charged on Wednesday over an attempt to set fire to a synagogue earlier this month. A further 70 arrests have been made for similar crimes in the neighbouring state of Victoria, where a synagogue was set on fire last month.

Sydney's Northern Beaches council said it has sent the debris to the New South Wales Environment Protection Authority (EPA) for further analysis. Nine beaches, including popular spots Manly and Dee Why, were closed on 14 January after the marble-sized balls started washing up. It came months after thousands of black blobs started appearing on the city's coasts in October, prompting authorities to close some of its most famous beaches for several days and order a massive clean-up. The latest batch of balls was cleaned up from harbour beaches this week, the Northern Beaches council said in its statement on Tuesday. It urged anyone who spotted the balls not to handle them and to contact authorities. Besides the acids and bacteria, the balls also contained volcanic rock pumice. Northern Beaches mayor Sue Heins said she hopes the EPA analysis will ""identify the source so that they can stop this from happening at other beaches"". ""We are continuing to conduct regular inspections of our beaches and encourage the community to report any sightings,"" she said. The first batch of debris in October were at first mistakenly called ""tar balls"" but were later found to contain everything from cooking oil and soap scum molecules, to blood pressure medication, pesticides, hair, methamphetamine and veterinary drugs. Scientists said they resembled fat, oil and grease blobs - often called ""fatbergs"" - which are commonly formed in sewage systems. But Sydney Water has reported that its water treatment plants are operating normally and that there were no known issues with waste systems in the city."

The Queensland woman claimed she was chronicling her child's battle with a terminal illness on social media, but detectives allege she was drugging the one-year-old and then filming her in ""immense distress and pain"". Doctors had raised the alarm in October, when the baby was admitted to hospital suffering a serious medical episode. After months of investigation, the 34-year-old woman was charged with torture, administering poison, making child exploitation material and fraud. ""[There are] no words for how repulsive offences of this nature are,"" Queensland Police Det Insp Paul Dalton told reporters on Thursday. Between August and October, detectives say that the woman - from the Sunshine Coast region - gave the child several prescription and pharmacy medicines, without approval. She went to great lengths to obtain the unauthorised medications and cover up her behaviour, they alleged, including using leftover medicine for a different person in their house. Police began investigating on 15 October, when the baby was brought into hospital experiencing ""severe emotional and physical distress and harm"". Tests for unauthorised medicines returned a positive result later in January, they said. However, Insp Dalton said the child was now ""safe and doing well"". The woman raised A$60,000 (£30,500; $37,300) through GoFundMe donations - which the site is attempting to repay, Det Insp Dalton said. Police had investigated other people over the alleged abuse, but there was no evidence to charge anyone else, he added. The woman is due to face Brisbane Magistrates Court on Friday."

The balls - this time grey or white in colour - have prompted councils to shut nine beaches, including popular Manly and Dee Why, while authorities investigate. Eight beaches including Bondi were closed for several days in October and a massive clean-up ordered after thousands of black deposits started appearing on the coast. Testing by authorities determined those balls were most likely the result of a sewage spill. Northern Beaches mayor Sue Heins said the latest balls ""could be anything"", according to the Guardian Australia. ""We don't know at the moment what it is and that makes it even more concerning,"" she said. ""There's something that's obviously leaking or dropping... floating out there and being tossed around."" In a post on Facebook on Tuesday, the Northern Beaches Council said they were alerted to the fresh debris by the New South Wales Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The agency and the council planned to collect the discoveries for testing and inspect other beaches in the area too. Anyone who spotted the balls was urged to contact authorities, the council added.

The unknowing bride said her partner was a social media influencer who convinced her to take part in the ceremony as a ""prank"" for his Instagram account. She only discovered the marriage was genuine when he tried to use it to gain permanent residency in Australia. A Melbourne judge granted the annulment after accepting the woman was tricked into getting married, in a judgement published on Thursday. The bizarre case began in September 2023 when the woman met her partner on an online dating platform. They began seeing each other regularly in Melbourne, where they lived at the time. In December that year, the man proposed to the woman and she accepted. Two days later, the woman attended an event with the man in Sydney. She was told it would be a ""white party"" - where attendees would wear white-coloured clothing - and was told to pack a white dress. But when they arrived she was ""shocked"" and ""furious"" to find no other guests present except for her partner, a photographer, the photographer's friend and a celebrant, according to her deposition quoted in court documents. ""So when I got there, and I didn't see anybody in white, I asked him, 'What's happening?'. And he pulled me aside, and he told me that he's organising a prank wedding for his social media, to be precise, Instagram, because he wants to boost his content, and wants to start monetising his Instagram page,"" she said. She said she had accepted his explanation as ""he was a social media person"" who had more than 17,000 followers on Instagram. She also believed that a civil marriage would be valid only if it were held in a court. Still, she remained concerned. The woman rang a friend and voiced her worries, but the friend ""laughed it off"" and said it would be fine because, if it were real, they would have had to file a notice of intended marriage first, which they had not. Reassured, the woman went through the ceremony where she and her partner exchanged wedding vows and kissed in front of a camera. She said she was happy at that time to ""play along"" to ""make it look real"". Two months later, her partner asked her to add him as a dependant in her application for permanent residency in Australia. Both of them are foreigners. When she told him she could not as they were technically not married, he then revealed that their Sydney wedding ceremony had been genuine, according to the woman's testimony. The woman later found their marriage certificate, and discovered a notice of intended marriage which had been filed the month before their Sydney trip - before they even got engaged - which she said she did not sign. According to the court documents, the signature on the notice bears little resemblance to the woman's. ""I'm furious with the fact that I didn't know that that was a real marriage, and the fact that he also lied from the beginning, and the fact that he also wanted me to add him in my application,"" she said. In his deposition, the man claimed they had ""both agreed to these circumstances"" and that following his proposal the woman had agreed to marry him at an ""intimate ceremony"" in Sydney. The judge ruled that the woman was ""mistaken about the nature of the ceremony performed"" and ""did not provide real consent to her participation"" in the marriage. ""She believed she was acting. She called the event 'a prank'. It made perfect sense for her to adopt the persona of a bride in all things at the impugned ceremony so as to enhance the credibility of the video depicting a legally valid marriage,"" he stated in the judgement. The marriage was annulled in October 2024."

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpw2w8qd7klo,How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war,2025-01-08T16:23:13.028Z,Tiffanie Turnbull,"For years, a controversial invader has been gradually taking over Australia's beloved beaches. Swallowing up the sand, blocking ocean views and turning the shore into an irksome maze, is a sea of large beach tents, called cabanas in Australia. ""It's chockers [crowded]. They're all over the place,"" Sydneysider Claire, 30, told the BBC. For her – and most Australians – cooling off on a sweltering day means a solid drive to the coast, plus an eternity trying to find a parking space. Now, the cabana craze means there's another battle waiting for them on the beach. Polyester covers flap in the breeze as far as the eye can see. Some are empty, set up at the crack of dawn and then abandoned for hours on end, until the owners actually want to use them. ""The sheer amount of space that people are taking up… [when] you're just trying to find a free square inch of sand to lay your towel, it can just be a little bit frustrating,"" Claire says. She's not alone in her irritation. Several summers of simmering tension has, in the first days of 2025, exploded into a full-on turf war, sparking debate about Australian culture and beach etiquette. A row over the acceptable use of cabanas has dominated social media, spawned a wave of opinion pieces and television segments, and even dragged in the prime minister. Self-described haters say entitled cabana crews are hogging public space and disrespecting other beachgoers. ""When you're… polluting the beach with your four cabanas next to each other, where is Guncle [Gay Uncle] Nic going to go,"" anti-cabana crusader and TikToker Nic Salerno said on TV talk show The Project. ""I just want my space on the beach, guys."" But the pro-cabana mob say seeking protection from Australia's vicious sun isn't a crime - and it's every man for himself. Australia is the skin cancer capital of the world, and many supporters – including national charity, the Cancer Council – argue the new trend should actually be celebrated. ""My partner and I have a cool cabana because we both burn extremely easily and we don't want to die of skin cancer by 30, hope this helps,"" one person wrote, responding to a TikTok rant. No one is discounting the importance of sun safety, the cabana critics counter, but they say that's just a convenient excuse for many of the people using the beach tents. Half the time they're not even sitting under the shade covers, they claim, and there's no need for two people to whip out an entire tent for an hour or two, when sun cream and a hat will do just fine. Other cabana devotees are more forward about their motivations. Breakfast television presenter Davina Smith admitted that for her, it is about nabbing ""the prime piece of real estate"" on busy beaches. She is one of the people who pitch their cabana castles in the early morning to reserve territory for her family later that day. ""There's a lot of research that goes into this. You get up early, you've got to watch the tides. You can't just plonk it there and walk away… you invest in it,"" Smith argued on Nine's Today programme. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was among the hordes irked by the trend: ""That's not on,"" he told the same show. ""One of the great things about Australia, unlike some parts of the world, you go and you got to pay to go to the beach. Here, everyone owns the beach… And that's a breach of that principle, really."" Even lifeguards have opinions on the matter, with some telling local media the cabana camps can make it hard for them to do their jobs. There are a number of cultural quirks which mean Cabanagate has Australians more worked up than a magpie in spring. Firstly, the country loves to think of itself as an egalitarian society – the land of a ""fair go"" – and that extends to the use of one of its most precious national assets. ""Australian beaches, they always have been seen as shared spaces, democratic spaces where social hierarchies dissolve…. [they're] seen as a great equaliser,"" says Ece Kaya, a researcher at the University of Technology Sydney. And Australians are ""fiercely"" protective of that ideal: ""They see it as a birthright,"" says Chris Pepin-Neff, who studies Australian beach culture. They point to the backlash in 1929 when beachgoers at Sydney's Coogee Beach were forced to pay for access to the only part of the water covered by shark nets. More recently, a bid to rent out part of Sydney's famous Bondi Beach to an exclusive beach club was met with a huge outcry. And while the use of sprawling cabanas is a relatively new phenomenon, there's long been ""enormous class tension"" around the use of the country's coastline, Dr Pepin-Neff adds. A lack of infrastructure, affordable housing and community attitudes tend to lock ordinary Australians out of waterfront areas, while those natural assets are often monopolised by those lucky enough to live there. ""And there's a perception that it's encroaching even further, [so] that an average family can't even get a spot at the beach."" But they say there's no real data on who is using cabanas and why. They also argue there's many good reasons people might use them. Maybe they've travelled a long way so they plan to stay at the beach longer, or they may have a disability or young children they need to cater for, he says. ""There is a balance between a free and open beach that everybody can use, and making sure that you're respectful."" They offer no defence for the ""land bankers"" though: ""As a Sydneysider, I think that is abusing the privilege… that is not a fair go."" As the debate intensifies though, there are some calls for a truce to restore the peace to Australian shores. Beachkit Australia founder Rowan Clark, who sells equipment including cabanas, told the Sydney Morning Herald newspaper even he thinks cabana lovers should be more courteous. ""They should only allow set up at the rear of the beach in a line,"" he said. ""Once this is exhausted, then no more of this style of shade should be allowed."" Others want authorities to rein it in, like some have in the United States. There are suggestions councils could limit how many cabanas can be set up on their beaches, and where. But Sydney resident Claire, for all her wrath, worries that this could tip the scales in the other direction and exclude other people from using the beach. ""You don't want to get too precious about it, obviously… it's just the beach, first world problems right? ""I think in general, we should just try to be considerate of one another."""

Medical student Hadi Nazari went missing on Boxing Day after he wandered off to take photos during a hike with his friends in Kosciuszko National Park in the Snowy Mountains region. Hundreds of people, including Mr Nazari's friends and family, joined search efforts to locate the 23-year-old. He was found by other hikers around 15:15 local time (04:15 GMT) on Wednesday. Mr Nazari had called out to the hikers and ""told them that he'd been lost in the bush and was thirsty"", Superintendent Andrew Spliet told reporters. After the hikers contacted emergency services, Mr Nazari was winched over to the search command post by a helicopter. He was assessed by paramedics at the scene and conveyed to a hospital. Mr Spliet said that Mr Nazari was found in good health - alert, able to speak and had no significant injuries. The two muesli bars, which Mr Nazari had found in a hut in the mountains, was ""pretty much all that he's had to consume over the last two weeks"", said Mr Spliet, adding that the hiker had also found water from creeks and foraged for berries. Mr Nazari's family, who were seen hugging him at the search base camp on Wednesday, later confirmed to local media that he was fine. ""It is the happiest day of our lives,"" they told 9News. Mr Nazari was found near Blue Lake, around 10km (6 miles) away from the campground where he was supposed to meet his friends on 26 December. ""He's covered a lot of ground in that time,"" said Spliet, adding that police would ""catch up with him"" after he is checked out of hospital."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2v14vxdjeo,To conserve or cull? Life in Australia's crocodile capital,2025-01-03T01:01:03.287Z,Katy Watson,"It's dawn on Darwin Harbour and government ranger Kelly Ewin - whose job is to catch and remove crocodiles - is balancing precariously on a floating trap. Heavy rain clouds from the storm that has recently passed are overhead. The engine of the boat has been cut so now it's mostly silent – that is, apart from the intermittent splashing coming from inside the trap. ""You get pretty much zero chances with these guys,"" says Ewin as he attempts to loop a noose around the jaw of the agitated reptile. We're in Australia's Northern Territory (NT), home to an estimated 100,000 wild saltwater crocodiles, more than anywhere in the world. The capital, Darwin, is a small coastal city surrounded by beaches and wetlands. And, as you quickly learn here in the NT, where there is water, there usually are crocs. Saltwater crocs - or salties, as they are known to locals - were nearly hunted to extinction 50 years ago. After World War Two, the uncontrolled trade in their skins soared and numbers fell to around 3,000. But when hunting was banned in 1971, the population started rising again - and fast. They still are a protected species, but are no longer threatened. The recovery of the saltwater crocodile has been so dramatic that Australia now faces a different dilemma: managing their numbers to keep people safe and the public onside. ""The worst thing that can happen is when people turn [against crocodiles],"" explains croc expert Prof Grahame Webb. ""And then a politician will invariably come along with some knee-jerk reaction [that] they're going to 'solve' the crocodile problem."" The NT's hot temperatures and abundant coastal surroundings create the perfect habitat for cold-blooded crocs, who need warmth to keep their body temperature constant. There also are big saltie populations in Northern Queensland and Western Australia as well as in parts of South East Asia. While most species of crocodile are harmless, the saltie is territorial and aggressive. Fatal incidents are rare in Australia, but they do happen. Last year, a 12-year-old was taken - the first death from a crocodile in the NT since 2018. This is busiest time of year for Ewin and his colleagues. Breeding season has just started, which means salties are on the move. His team are on the water several times a week, checking the 24 crocodile traps surrounding the city of Darwin. The area is popular for fishing, as well as for some brave swimmers. The crocodiles that are removed from the harbour are most often killed, because if they are released elsewhere, they're likely to return to the harbour. ""It's our job to try and keep people as safe as we can,"" says Ewin, who's been doing his ""dream job"" for two years. Before that, he was a policeman. ""Obviously, we're not going to capture every crocodile, but the more we take out of the harbour, the less risk there's going to be an encounter with crocodiles and people."" Another tool helping to keep the public safe is education. The NT government goes into schools with its programme ""Be Crocwise"" - which teaches people how to behave responsibly around croc habitats. It's been such a success that Florida and the Philippines are now looking to borrow it, in order to better understand how the world's most dangerous predators can live alongside humans with minimal interactions. ""We're living in crocodile country, so it's about how we [keep ourselves] safe around the waterways - how should we be responding?"" says Natasha Hoffman, a ranger who runs the programme in the NT. ""If you're on the boats when you're fishing, you need to be aware that they're there. They're ambush hunters, they sit, watch and wait. If the opportunity is there for them to grab some food, that's what they're going to do."" In the NT, mass culling is currently not on the table given the protected status of the species. Last year though, the government approved a new 10-year crocodile management plan to help control the numbers, which increased the quota of crocs that can be killed annually from 300 to 1,200. This is on top of the work Ewin's team is doing to remove any crocodiles that pose a direct threat to humans. Every time there's a death, it reignites the debate about crocodiles living in close proximity to people. In the days after the 12-year-old girl was taken last year, the Territory's then leader Eva Lawler made it clear she wouldn't allow the reptiles to outnumber the human population of the NT. Currently that stands at 250,000, well above the number of wild crocs. It's a conversation that goes beyond the NT. Queensland is home to about a quarter of the number of crocs that the Top End of NT has, but there are far more tourists, and more deaths, which means talk of culls sometimes feature in election debates. The apex predators may court controversy, but they're also a big draw card for the NT – for tourists but also for fashion brands keen to buy their leather. Visitors can head to the Adelaide River to watch ""croc jumping"" - which involves salties being fed bits of meat on the end of a stick if they can leap out of the water for their audience. ""I'm supposed to tell you to put your [life-jackets] on,"" jokes the head skipper at Spectacular Jumping Croc Cruises, Alex 'Wookie' Williams, as he explains the house rules of the boat. ""The bit I don't have to tell you… [is that] life jackets are pretty useless out here."" For Williams, who's been obsessed with crocs since childhood, there's plenty of opportunity to work alongside them. ""It's boomed over the last 10 years or so,"" he says of the number of tourists coming to the region. Farming, which was brought in when hunting was banned, has also become an economic driver. It's estimated there are now about 150,000 crocodiles in captivity in the NT. Fashion labels such as Louis Vuitton and Hermès - which sells a Birkin 35 croc handbag for as much as A$800,000 ($500,000; £398,000) - have all invested in the industry. ""The commercial incentives were effectively put in place to help people tolerate crocodiles, because we need a social licence to be able to use wildlife,"" says Mick Burns, one of the NT's most prominent farmers who works with luxury brands. His office is in downtown Darwin. Spread across the floor is a massive croc skin. Pinned to the wall of the conference room, there is another skin that spans at least four metres. Burns is also involved with a ranch in remote Arnhem Land, about 500km (310 miles) east of Darwin. There, he works with Aboriginal rangers to harvest and hatch croc eggs to sell their skins to the luxury goods industry. One of the area's Traditional Owners, Otto Bulmaniya Campion, who works alongside Burns, says more partnerships like theirs are crucial for ensuring Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities share in the financial benefits of the industry. For tens of thousands of years, crocs have played a significant role in Indigenous cultures, shaping their sacred stories, lives and livelihoods. ""My father, all the elders, used to go and harpoon crocodiles, get a skin, and go and trade it for tea, flour, and sugar. [However] there was no money at that time,"" the Balngarra man says. ""Now, we want to see our own people handling reptiles."" But not everyone is on board with farming as a practice - even if those involved say it helps with conservation. The concern among animal activists lies in the way the crocs are held in captivity. Despite being social animals, they are usually confined to individual pens to ensure their skins are flawless - as a scrap between two territorial crocs would almost certainly damage a valuable commodity. Everyone in Darwin has a story about these formidable creatures, regardless of whether they want to see them hunted in greater numbers or more rigorously preserved. But the threat they continue to pose is not imagined. ""If you go [swimming in] the Adelaide river next to Darwin, there's a 100% chance you'll be killed,"" says Prof Webb matter-of-factly. ""The only question is whether it's going to take five minutes or 10 minutes. I don't think you'll ever get to 15 - you'll be torn apart,"" he adds, pushing up his trouser leg to reveal a huge scar on his calf - evidence of a close encounter with one angry female nearly forty years ago as he was collecting eggs. He is unapologetic about what he calls the pragmatism of authorities to manage numbers and make money out of crocs along the way - a way of life that, in the near future at least, is here to stay. ""We've done what very few people can do, which is take a very serious predator…and then manage them in such a way that the public is prepared to [tolerate] them. ""You try and get people in Sydney or London or New York to put up with a serious predator - they aren't going to do it."" Additional reporting by Simon Atkinson. "
https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c8xjw8v99kdo,The making of Konstas - Australia's new batting star,2024-12-31T08:27:08.431Z,,"Sam Konstas first revealed his plan to ramp Jasprit Bumrah over a pre-match meal late on Christmas Day. ""We had dinner the night before the game and he said he would do it on 150 if he got there,"" his batting coach Tahmid Islam tells BBC Sport. Fast forward a few hours and debutant Konstas, Australia's new 19-year-old batting sensation, was doing so on Boxing Day in front of 90,000 people at the iconic Melbourne Cricket Ground. Only, he had not waited until his 150th run, and not even his 150th ball. ""Initially I thought I might be out of a job as batting coach when he missed the first couple,"" Islam says. Konstas may have failed with those first two scoops, but he tried again soon after and hit Bumrah - the world's top-ranked bowler - for a six and two fours on the way to 60 from 65 balls. Those shots marked one of the most remarkable starts to a Test career in recent memory – cult hero status gained in a matter of minutes by a batter long tipped for the top. Because, while Konstas' emergence at the highest level was explosive, the journey to get there has been long. He was the Sydney suburb kid of Greek heritage who was scoring hundreds before his age had reached double figures. In October he became the youngest player since the great Ricky Ponting to score centuries in each innings of a match in the Sheffield Shield, Australia's first-class competition. Two years before that, and just a month after his 17th birthday, Konstas became the youngest batter to score a century for Sutherland in the top tier of Sydney's notoriously tough grade cricket. The previous holder of that record? A certain Steve Smith. ""I remember not being too surprised it was him that did it,"" says Sutherland captain Tom Doyle. The talent has always been there, those scoop shots too. ""We had a T20 game and he had come off a hundred in the U21s game in the morning,"" says Doyle, remembering another innings by Konstas while still aged 17. ""I remember him getting sledged by the opposition and he preceded to ramp like he did for Australia against some pretty intimidating first grade bowlers."" A host of internationals have passed through the club's pavilion - Smith, Shane Watson, West Indies legend Andy Roberts and Glenn McGrath to name a few. Konstas joined as a 17-year-old in 2022 from St George's - the club where the great Sir Don Bradman once played - in a switch that made the newspapers, such was the noise around him. ""It is hard to compare,"" Doyle says. ""From a talent level, Sam is no doubt on par. ""He is on this upwards curve where he keeps getting better and better each time he plays."" Those that know Konstas describe him as polite and a hard worker. During his time at Cranbrook School, then in his early teens, he first met Islam - a former first-class cricketer and a batting consultant in the school's cricket set-up. He and Islam speak every day, practising together numerous times per week, while Watson, the all-rounder who played 307 times for Australia, has become a mentor working on Konstas' mental approach. ""The one that really sticks out was when I was at the rugby grand final and Sammy kept calling me,"" Islam says. ""He wasn't quite happy with how he had batted in his club session, had a game the next day and wanted a net session at 6am before his game. ""I remember thinking I have never seen anyone have that desire and hunger to make sure he has ticked every box to give himself the best chance. ""He hit for about an hour and a half and got 205 in that game."" While Konstas' first innings in international cricket had all of the shots of a Bazballer, scoring big hundreds is how he made his name. ""Looking back on a lot of Sam's innings, he doesn't play every day of cricket the same,"" says Sutherland's Doyle. ""He is a multi-dimensional cricketer. The way he played in a lot of his first grade innings is more traditional, with a spark of flair here and there."" The other thing people mention when talking about Konstas is confidence. The confidence to ramp Bumrah, the confidence to not be put off by a shoulder barge by Virat Kohli, the confidence to point to the name on the back of his shirt when reaching 50 and wave his arm to ramp up the capacity Boxing Day crowd. England might well be taking notes, with the Ashes coming up towards the end of 2025 down under. ""There can be a blurred line between arrogance and confidence,"" Doyle says. ""Sam has, through a lot of hard work and persistence, developed a level of confidence to score runs in a way that works for him. ""You see him revving up the crowds. We don't have crowds at grade cricket but that is his personality coming out. He is an energised, enthusiastic and eager cricketer. ""Him being that person for the crowd is just his personality coming out."" That confidence will, of course, be tested as his international career continues. The second-innings effort was more difficult for Konstas, as he reached only eight before Bumrah gained some revenge with an inswinger that hit middle stump having gone through the gate. ""He has always had this desire and hunger to get it right and to continue to develop his game,"" Islam says of Konstas. ""At the start of every season we write down a few goals and plans for the season coming up and playing Test cricket certainly wasn't part of that."" Those goals may have changed after Konstas' week in the spotlight. He will hope the run-scoring does not."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjdnkdg1l8do,Chlamydia could make koalas extinct. Can a vaccine save them in time?,2024-12-29T16:03:09.183Z,Tiffanie Turnbull,"On the table, unconscious and stretched out on a pillow, Joe Mangy looks deceptively peaceful. The koala's watery, red-rimmed eyes are the only sign of the disease at war with his body. Tubes snarl out of a mask covering his face as a vet tech listens to his chest with a stethoscope. He is not healing as well as they had hoped. Eight days earlier, Joe Mangy – who is about two years old – was found wandering in the middle of a suburban road. Dazed and confused, eyes nearly glued shut with mucus, he was rushed here, to the Currumbin Wildlife Sanctuary's hospital. Enveloped by rainforest on Queensland's Gold Coast, the park is full of koalas like this. Outside the clinic, in a ""Koala Rehab Centre"" faintly perfumed by eucalyptus leaves, is a three-year-old recovering from a hysterectomy. ""It saved her life… but she can't reproduce,"" the head vet Michael Pyne says. Another male koala stares blankly through narrowed slits. His left tear duct is so inflamed his eyeball is barely visible. This hospital is ground zero of a grim chlamydia epidemic which is killing thousands of koalas and making even more sterile, pushing the national icons to the brink of extinction. But it's also at the core of desperate bid to save them with a vaccine – frustrated efforts which, after over a decade, are still tied up in regulation and running out of both time and money. Even a few decades ago, spotting a koala snuggled in a backyard tree was nothing out of the ordinary. They were plentiful on the country's populous east coast. But in recent times the species has been in dramatic decline – in some places plummeting by 80% in just 10 years. Land clearing and urbanisation are leaving the marsupials hungry and homeless, while natural disasters are drowning or cooking them en masse. ""[But] it's the chlamydia that shot up tremendously - almost exponentially,"" says Dr Pyne, who has run the Currumbin clinic for more than 20 years. ""You get days where you're euthanising heaps of koalas that just come in completely ravaged."" Estimates vary greatly – koalas are famously difficult to count – but some groups say as few as 50,000 of the animals are left in the wild and the species is officially listed as endangered on most of the eastern seaboard. There are now fears the animals will be extinct in some states within a generation. Dr Pyne wistfully recounts ""the early days"" when his hospital only saw a handful of koalas a year. They now see 400. So many come through the door that the team has started giving them two names, a vet nurse says, cradling Joe Mangy as he wakes from the anaesthetic. His last name is a nod to the state of his eyes when he first arrived, she explains. Of the top reasons koalas are brought into wildlife hospitals – vehicle strikes, pet attacks and chlamydia – the bacterial infection is the biggest and deadliest. It results in conjunctivitis for koalas like Joe Mangy, but presents as an infection of the genitals and urinary system for others. Particularly unlucky animals, get both at the same time. At its worst, the ocular form can be so bad koalas are blinded and starve to death, while the urogenital infection produces giant fluid-filled cysts so ""nasty"" everyday bodily functions like passing urine make the animals cry out in pain. ""Their reproductive system falls apart,"" Dr Pyne explains. If caught early enough, treatment is an option, but that in itself is a potentially fatal ""nightmare"" as the antibiotics destroy the gut bacteria which allow koalas to digest otherwise toxic eucalyptus leaves – their main food source. On a species level though, the disease, which spreads through bodily fluids, causes even greater ruin. Chlamydia is not uncommon in other animals – koalas are suspected to have first caught it from livestock – but the spread and intensity of the disease amongst the marsupials is unmatched. Experts estimate around half of koalas in Queensland and New South Wales could be infected, but just a suburb away from Currumbin, in Elanora, that has climbed beyond 80%. It is the most diseased population in the region and numbers have been ""falling off a cliff"", Dr Pyne says. ""It's a disaster."" Enter the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) and their vaccine, which aims to prevent and treat chlamydia in koalas and has been almost two decades in the making. Alongside Currumbin, they're trying to save the Elanora koalas from oblivion: capturing 30 youngsters and vaccinating them, before recatching them at intervals over three years to track their health. So far only three of the vaccinated koalas in this research trial have contracted the disease, though all recovered, and encouragingly, more than two dozen joeys have been born - bucking the infertility trend. ""There's generations of koalas now that have come through. We've got grand joeys,"" Dr Pyne says excitedly. Currumbin has also been vaccinating every koala which comes through their hospital, and have reached about 400 koalas this way. But treating and vaccinating each koala with chlamydia costs them about A$7,000 (£3,500, $4,500). Capturing, jabbing, and tracking each wild Elanora koala is basically double that. Two hours away, researchers at the University of the Sunshine Coast (UniSC) are doing their best to flatten the wave of disease too, with a separate vaccine. They inoculate about 2,000 koalas a year through wildlife hospital trials and tack themselves onto development projects or research studies in the region that involve their capture. They've just wrapped a decade's-worth of those projects into one study of more than 600 animals – the largest and longest of its kind. Incredibly, deaths dropped by two thirds among vaccinated koalas. Molecular biologist Samuel Phillips tells the BBC about one local koala population they studied which was at risk of extinction. Authorities are now looking at translocating some animals so they don't overpopulate the area. ""It turned it around completely."" And crucially, the study found that the koalas that did contract chlamydia were doing so later in life, after their peak breeding years had begun. Dr Phillips and his research partner Peter Timms have now submitted their vaccine to the federal regulator for approval but say they're keeping their hopes in check. ""There'll be hurdles,"" Dr Timms explains. In the meantime, for their small, overstretched team, dividing time and funding is an impossible balance. Do they involve themselves in as many trials as possible to help small groups of koalas now, or do they devote their efforts to advancing the tedious research and approval process which could help a huge cohort of them down the track? ""People come to us semi-regularly and say, 'Can we vaccinate more koalas?' And the answer at some point is 'No', because otherwise we're just spending all our time and energy doing [that],"" Dr Timms says. It has now been a decade since these two research teams first started seeing results, and there is still no real timeline on when a jab will be ready. And even when it is, there are huge barriers to any roll out. While making the vaccine isn't that costly, finding, capturing, and vaccinating wild koalas is extraordinarily expensive and time-consuming. Dr Phillips says they would have to strategically target select populations, though they're not yet sure how many koalas in each they'd need to treat to reverse decline. That challenge will be doubly complicated with the QUT vaccine, though, because it requires two doses, as opposed to UniSC's single-shot formula. The QUT team has been developing an implant – inspired by a human contraceptive device – that dissolves after four weeks to provide the booster. It will be trialled on Currumbin's captive koalas next year. Then there is the question of funding, which has been, and continues to be, fickle. Both vaccine developers provide their shots to wildlife hospitals and research trials for free, relying on individual donors, generosity from their universities, and the unpredictable whims of election cycles. State and federal governments are the biggest financial backers of the vaccine projects – last year Canberra gave QUT and UniSC A$750,000 each. ""No-one wants to imagine an Australia without koalas,"" Environment Minister Tanya Plibersek said at the time. But government contributions are random, and never quite enough. ""I cannot believe somebody will not come along tomorrow and say 'You need to vaccinate? Here's my cheque to cover the next 10 years'. But we can't find them,"" Dr Timms says. However, the biggest barrier is the mountain of red tape researchers are yet to cut through. Both groups have conservation charities and wildlife hospitals knocking down the door, desperate for access, but until they go through the ""painful"" approval process, their hands are largely tied. ""[It's] a critical step that is just taking too long. It kills me,"" Dr Pyne says. ""We've kind of passed it being urgent. It was urgent probably 10 years ago."" Adding to their despondency, is a fact all involved stress repeatedly: the vaccine is simply not enough to save the species. And so even the lucky koalas like Joe Mangy, who dodge death by chlamydia and return to the wild, still must face off against a myriad of other mortal threats. ""It's death by a thousand cuts, right?"" Dr Timms says."

Luke Walford, a youth pastor, had been spearfishing with his family when he was bitten on Saturday afternoon. He sustained ""life-threatening injuries"" and despite paramedics' efforts, he died at the scene about an hour later, authorities said. He and his family had been in the water at Humpy Island, in the Great Barrier Reef's Keppel Bay Islands National Park, when the attack happened. The area is a popular spot for diving and snorkelling. Walford had been a school chaplain and pastor at the Cathedral of Praise church in Rockhampton, Queensland. Donna Kirkland, his local MP, said she was in shock, and that Walford was a friend to her and ""countless others."" ""My prayers and heartfelt condolences are with his beautiful family and indeed the many who will be devastated, as I am, at this news"", she added. A family friend told ABC News he had watched the rescue helicopter fly over his house, unaware it was for his friend. ""I always say a little tribute for whoever it may be, but to find out it was Luke was a very sad day,"" Doug Webber said. Queensland police said a report would be prepared for the coroner. Australia's last fatal shark attack happened in December 2023, when a teenage boy was killed in the south. Just this year, there have been four other shark incidents in Australia, according to a local database. In general, Australia sees more shark attacks than any other country except the US."

The couple held a wedding ceremony in Sardinia in September, and were subsequently formally married at the service in Sydney, which was officiated by Wilson's sister. The actress proposed to Agruma, a fashion and jewellery designer, at Disneyland in 2023. Among well-wishers commenting on social media were Pitch Perfect co-stars Adam Devine and Elizabeth Banks, who offered their congratulations to the couple. Wilson, 44, said it felt ""right"" to get married in her hometown: ""It meant my 94-year-old grandmother Gar could come, which was very special to us to have her included,"" she wrote on Instagram. Agruma also shared photos from the day adding: ""Married officially in Australia to my Australian princess."" The couple are pictured beaming with the famous Sydney Harbour Bridge serving as the backdrop. The Bridesmaids actress announced the birth of her first child, via a surrogate in November 2022. Sharing a picture of daughter Royce Lilly, she described her as a ""beautiful miracle"". The star made headlines earlier this year when the US version of her memoir, Rebel Rising, which delved into Wilson's sexuality, weight and fertility, was released, and made allegations against Borat star Sacha Baron Cohen. The British edition of the book, published on 25 April, blacked out text believed to be relating to him. A spokesman for Baron Cohen at the time said the redactions represented a ""clear victory"", and reiterated the actor's position that Wilson's claims were ""demonstrably false"". In her memoir, Wilson also talked about being a ""late bloomer"" and losing her virginity at 35."

Both crew members died in separate incidents after being hit by a boom - the large pole attached horizontally to the bottom of a sail. The event's organisers said the incidents happened on the Flying Fish Arctos and Bowline. The first boats are expected to arrive in the city of Hobart, in Tasmania, later on Friday or early on Saturday. Several have already retired due to bad weather. New South Wales (NSW) police said the first incident was reported to officers just before midnight on Thursday local time (12:50 GMT) by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in the country's capital, Canberra. Just over two hours later, at 02:15 on Friday, NSW police were told that crew aboard the second boat were giving CPR to the second person, which also had not worked. Flying Fish Arctos had been sailing approximately 30 nautical miles east/south-east of the NSW town of Ulladulla, the organisers said. Bowline, meanwhile, was approximately 30 nautical miles east/north-east of the town of Batemans Bay, also in NSW. ""Our thoughts are with the crews, family and friends of the deceased,"" the organisers said in a statement. ""The Sydney to Hobart is an Australian tradition, and it is heart-breaking that two lives have been lost at what should be a time of joy,"" said Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese. The race, which began on Thursday, has continued. It is not the first time there have been fatalities during the race, which was first held in 1945.

The series is currently tied at 1-1 with two matches left to play. ""He's composed, relaxed, knows his game is in a good place at the moment, he'll play Boxing Day,"" said Australia coach Andrew McDonald. ""We're really excited for him, Boxing Day, the biggest stage. He might as well get that one out of the way early."" New South Wales' Konstas will be Australia's youngest batting debutant since Ian Craig in 1953. Earlier this season Konstas scored two centuries against South Australia in the Sheffield Shield, becoming the youngest player to do so since Ricky Ponting in 1993. McDonald said he has been selected to take the game to India at the Melbourne Cricket Ground, with bowlers having had the upper hand in the series so far. ""We want to throw a different challenge at India at this point in time,"" said McDonald. ""We believe Nathan [McSweeney] is good enough for Test level. We weren't sure about how the top order was functioning. We challenged ourselves for that decision. Whether it works or not, time will tell (but) we're really confident that Sam can do the job."" McDonald was also ""pretty confident"" Travis Head would be fit to play despite a quad strain preventing him from training on Monday. The 30-year-old left-hand batter has scored 409 runs including two centuries in the first three Tests, McDonald also said that paceman Scott Boland would likely come in for the injured Josh Hazlewood, and confirmed all-rounder Mitchell Marsh was fit to play. Skipper Pat Cummins is set to reveal the rest of the Australia line-up on Wednesday, with the match starting at 23:30 GMT. There will be ball-by-ball commentary on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app, where video highlights will also be available (all UK users only). "

Communities around the Grampians, in Victoria, have been evacuated amid warnings from authorities that conditions there in the days ahead could be the worst since Australia's most severe fire season on record, the so-called ""Black Summer"" of 2019-20. The bushfires have already burnt over 41,000 hectares (101,000 acres) of land in the past week, however there have been no deaths or loss of property. Intense heat forecast for Boxing Day has also prompted a string of fire warnings across the country. Throughout Victoria, temperatures are expected to reach 40C (104F) and be accompanied by strong dry winds, while parts of South Australia and New South Wales could also face bushfire conditions on Thursday into Friday. ""We're expecting to see extreme fire danger across almost the entire state,"" Luke Hegarty, a spokesman for Victoria's State Control Centre, said. ""This is the most significant fire danger that the state has seen – across the whole sections of state that we're talking about – since Black Summer. It's important that people understand that Thursday is a day with serious potential,"" he added. Four interstate firefighting forces and two incident management teams - made up of over 100 personnel - will land in Victoria in the coming days to provide reprieve for emergency crews that have been working around the clock to fight the current fires. The decision to give families around the Grampians temporary access to their homes ""to get Christmas items … presents and the like"" on Tuesday morning was made by the state's Country Fire Authority (CFA) chief officer, Jason Heffernan. ""[This is] to ensure if the residents of Halls Gap will be relocated for Christmas, at least they will have what they need,"" he told Seven's Sunrise programme. Mary Ann Brown, who lives on the southern edge of the Grampians National Park, told the ABC that her community are on edge heading into the holidays. ""We are not out of the woods until we get a really good drop of rain and that may not come until March or April, so it's going to be a long summer."" Parts of Australia have been on high alert for bushfire danger this summer, following several quieter seasons compared with the 2019-20 fires which were linked to hundreds of deaths and swept across 24 million hectares of land. The country has reeled from disaster to disaster in recent years, experiencing both record breaking floods and extreme heat, as it feels the effects of climate change."

Burt, who was thought to be over 90 years old, appeared alongside Paul Hogan and Linda Kozlowski in the 1986 movie. News of his death was confirmed by staff at Crocosaurus Cove in Darwin, a reptile and aquarium attraction where Burt had lived since 2008. In a statement posted on Instagram, the wildlife centre wrote: ""It is with great sadness that we announce the passing of Burt, the iconic saltwater crocodile and star of the Australian classic Crocodile Dundee. ""Burt passed away peacefully over the weekend, estimated to be over 90 years old, marking the end of an incredible era."" In the film, character Mick Dundee (Hogan) swaps the Australian outback for the jungle of New York after meeting American reporter Sue Charlton (Kozlowski), who eventually falls in love with him. The croc is famously seen in the scene where Kozlowski's character is attacked as she kneels next to a creek. Burt, who was captured in the 1980s in the Northern Territory's Reynolds River, was described by Crocasourus Cove as having a ""bold"" personality. ""Burt was a confirmed bachelor - an attitude he made clear during his earlier years at a crocodile farm,"" the centre's statement continued. ""His fiery temperament earned him the respect of his caretakers and visitors alike, as he embodied the raw and untamed spirit of the saltwater crocodile."" ""Burt was truly one of a kind. He wasn't just a crocodile; he was a force of nature and a reminder of the power and majesty of these incredible creatures. ""While his personality could be challenging, it was also what made him so memorable and beloved by those who worked with him and the thousands who visited him over the years. The statement concluded: ""Visitors from around the globe marvelled at his impressive size and commanding presence, especially at feeding time."" It's not unusual for saltwater crocodiles to live beyond 70 years old, especially in captivity. Burt will be honoured with a commemorative sign at the attraction.  Crocodile Dundee remains the highest grossing Australian film of all time, taking $47,707,598 (Australian dollars). It also spawned two sequels, 1988's Crocodile Dundee II and 2001's Crocodile Dundee in Los Angeles. Hogan and Kozlowski got married in 1990 but later divorced. A documentary on the making of the film is expected to be released next year. "

New South Wales' Konstas is in line to become Australia men's youngest Test batting debutant since Ian Craig in 1953. McSweeney was preferred to Konstas at the start of the series but he managed only 72 runs across six innings at an average of 14.40. Australia's chief selector George Bailey said Konstas' selection offers the chance to ""throw something different"" at India's bowling attack. ""I think Sam's method and style is different to Nathan's, should we go down that path,"" he said. Earlier this season Konstas scored two centuries against South Australia in the Sheffield Shield, becoming the youngest player to do so since Ricky Ponting in 1993. Should the right-hander be picked, he would become Australia's youngest Test debutant since current skipper Pat Cummins, who was 18 years and 193 days when he played against South Africa in 2011. Seamer Jhye Richardson, who last played a Test in the 2021-22 Ashes, has also been recalled with Josh Hazlewood out injured. Fellow quick Sean Abbott and all-rounder Beau Webster, both uncapped at Test level, have been retained in the squad, having been called up previously in the series but not selected in the XI. Usman Khawaja and Marnus Labuschagne, who, like McSweeney, have struggled at the top of the order, have retained their places in the squad. The Boxing Day Test in Melbourne starts at 23:30 GMT on 25 December with the series tied at 1-1. There will be ball-by-ball commentary on BBC Sounds, BBC Radio 5 Sports Extra and the BBC Sport website and app, where video highlights will also be available (all UK users only).

Part of the Australia team that won the Under-19 World Cup earlier this year, his breakthrough came with the twin centuries against South Australia in October when he followed a first-innings 152 - his first first-class hundred - with 105 in the second innings. He has scored 471 runs at 58.87 in five matches in the Sheffield Shield this season and made a timely, 20-ball fifty for Sydney Thunder on his Big Bash debut on Tuesday, in doing so becoming the youngest man to score a fifty in the competition. He also played for Prime Ministers XI against the India squad in a tour match between the first and second Tests and scored 107 from 97 balls against an attack featuring most of India's Test line-up. He will still play in the Big Bash against Sydney Sixers on Saturday before joining up with the Test squad."

The 29-year-old, whose real name is Andrés Felipe Valencia Barrientos, admitted to driving at almost 60km/h (37mph) over the speed limit on a Perth highway last month. He is yet to enter a plea on eight sexual assault charges, over allegations he attacked a woman in his Perth hotel room after performing at a nightclub in September. Barrientos is best known for his work with the YouTube collective Beta Squad, and has presented shows on BBC Three. Barrientos appeared in Perth Magistrates Court on Thursday, where his lawyer said her client would enter a plea of guilty to the driving offence, which resulted in his car being impounded. The case was adjourned until 30 January, to be heard alongside Barrientos' other charges, which include four counts of sexual penetration without consent, three counts of assault occasioning bodily harm and one count of choking. The rapper was on tour in Australia performing his music when the alleged rape occurred. His bail conditions bar him from leaving the state of Western Australia or posting about the case on social media. Barrientos is a popular media figure in the UK, winning a Mobo Award for best media personality in 2021. He has also appeared on ITV's Soccer Aid and Channel 4's Great Celebrity Bake Off for Stand Up To Cancer."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp9n4vyjy2mo,Australian radio host pleads not guilty to sex abuse,2024-12-18T02:22:49.385Z,Tiffanie Turnbull,"Veteran Australian broadcaster Alan Jones has pleaded not guilty to sexually abusing 10 young men over almost two decades. The 83-year-old faces 34 charges over alleged incidents between 2001 and 2019, including 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault. Mr Jones is one of Australia's most influential media figures and a former coach of its national rugby union team. He has previously denied allegations of abuse, first published by The Sydney Morning Herald in 2023. After appearing in court, he spoke publicly for the first time since his arrest last month, saying: ""I have never indecently assaulted these people."" ""I want you to understand this: these allegations are all either baseless or they distort the truth, and you should know that prior to my arrest I was given no opportunity by police to answer any of these allegations."" Mr Jones was taken into custody at his Sydney apartment on 18 November, as detectives from the New South Wales (NSW) Police Child Abuse Squad searched the harbour-front property and seized electronic devices. Originally charged in relation to eight people - including a 17-year-old boy - police have since filed additional charges, and say investigations are continuing. All the charges, except two of common assault, are sex offences. Police said some of the alleged victims knew the radio and TV host personally, and that at least one had been employed by him. Others were allegedly assaulted the first time they met him, NSW Police's Michael Fitzgerald told reporters last month. ""The law assumes that I am not guilty, and I am not guilty,"" Mr Jones told the media scrum waiting for him after his first court appearance in Sydney on Wednesday. ""That's all I can say at the moment, but I am emphatic that I'll be defending every charge before a jury in due course."" A former teacher, Mr Jones coached the Wallabies between 1984 and 1988, before pivoting to a radio career. He also, at times, worked as a speechwriter and advisor for Liberal Party figures - including former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser - and launched several failed bids to represent the party in both state and federal politics. A staple of Sydney airwaves on local station 2GB for decades, Mr Jones juggled those duties with TV commentary gigs before he retired from full time work in 2020 citing health issues. The broadcaster is a polarising figure, for years boasting one of the nation's biggest audiences but often courting controversy. He made headlines in 2012 for suggesting that then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard's father had ""died of shame"", and in 2019 faced a massive advertiser boycott after saying someone should ""shove a sock"" down the throat of New Zealand's leader at the time, Jacinda Ardern."

The 33-year-old felt tightness in his calf during the warm-up ahead of day four in the third Test in Brisbane, and left the field after bowling one over in the morning session. He was sent for scans and Australia say the injury is likely to result in him missing the fourth and fifth Tests in Melbourne and Sydney. The right-armer missed the second-Test win in Adelaide with a side injury. He was replaced by Scott Boland, while uncapped duo Sean Abbott and Brendan Doggett were added to the squad. ""He felt it this morning in warm-ups and gave it a good crack,"" said bowling coach Daniel Vettori. ""It's just unfortunate for him to come back after putting so much effort in after another injury. It was tough on him. ""He's one of the best bowlers in the world and it obviously affects the whole team."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjr2l1gvg3qo,Bali Nine drug smugglers 'relieved' to be back in Australia,2024-12-16T05:36:04.816Z,Tiffanie Turnbull and Rachel Hagan,"The five remaining members of the infamous ""Bali Nine"" drug ring say they are ""relieved and happy"" to be home in Australia, after serving nearly 20 years in Indonesian prisons. Matthew Norman, Scott Rush, Martin Stephens, Si Yi Chen, and Michael Czugaj arrived in Darwin on Sunday following years of lobbying by Australia on their behalf. ""They look forward, in time, to reintegrating back into and contributing to society,"" said a statement issued on behalf of the men and their families. The high-profile case began in 2005 when Indonesia caught nine young Australians trying to smuggle 8.3kg (18lb) of heroin out of Bali strapped to their bodies. The eight men and one woman were arrested at an airport and hotel in Bali after a tip-off from Australian police. The case made global headlines when two of the gang's ringleaders, Andrew Chan and Myuran Sukumaran, were executed by firing squad in 2015 - sparking a diplomatic row between neighbours Indonesia and Australia. Other members of the Bali Nine - most of whom were aged under 21 - were handed sentences of either 20 years or life in prison. The case put a spotlight on Indonesia's strict drug laws, some of the most stringent in the world. One of the nine, Tan Duc Thanh Nguyen, died of cancer in prison in 2018. Shortly afterwards, Renae Lawrence, then 41, the only woman among the group, had her sentence commuted after spending almost 13 years in prison and returned to Australia the same year. Indonesia did not commute the sentences of the remaining five, now aged 38 to 48, and they were transported back to Australia as prisoners. However the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) has reported that the men are effectively free to live unhindered in Australian society. The five are banned for life from entering Indonesia, a spokesman for the government there said in a statement. On Monday, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said he had spoken to several of the men's ""grateful"" parents. ""They did a serious crime and they have rightly paid a serious price for it. But it was time for them to come home,"" he told reporters. He said the deal did not come with conditions or favours Australia would have to repay: ""This is an act of compassion by President Prabowo [Subianto] and we thank him for it."" The men and their families also said they were ""immensely grateful"" to Prabowo. They also thanked the lawyers, diplomats and government figures who had helped advocate for them over the past two decades, before asking for privacy. ""The welfare of the men is a priority, they will need time and support, and we hope and trust our media and community will make allowance for this."" The five men are being put through medical checks at Darwin's Howard Springs facility - which was used for quarantine during the pandemic - and will begin a voluntary ""rehabilitation process"", Education Minister Jason Clare said. It is not clear what that entails, or how long the men will stay there. He added that normal visa processes would apply to any Indonesian family members of the men, who did not follow them to Australia. The Bishop of Townsville, Timothy Harris, who has supported the families of Scott Rush and Michael Czugaj since their arrests, said he immediately called Scott Rush's father Lee when he heard the news. Scott's parents are eagerly awaiting the reunion, Bishop Harris told the BBC. ""They are mortified by what their son did. They always believed he has committed a crime... But this turn of events [has] filled them with a sense of anticipation."" However, he said it would take time for the men to heal from their experience and re-integrate into society. ""If you think that through, your son commits a crime [and was] incarcerated in a foreign country, they return. How does someone get re-integrated into the family, let alone society?"" ""Things have changed. The relationships need to be rekindled. They are going to have to face that as time goes on,"" he said. ""Once [Scott's family] gets to embrace him... I hope and pray things will be better, because there's nothing like having your family [nearby]."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8nkxrrnpzo,Pilot avoids jail over crash that killed UK tourist,2024-12-13T03:17:21.601Z,Tiffanie Turnbull,"A pilot who caused a deadly light plane crash on an island in Australia's Great Barrier Reef has been spared a jail sentence. British tourist Jocelyn Spurway, 29, was killed and 21-year-old Irish woman Hannah O'Dowd seriously injured when the aircraft hit the sand on Middle Island in January 2017. A jury found pilot Leslie Woodall guilty of dangerously operating a vehicle causing death and grievous bodily harm, after a short trial which focused on his actions after the plane's engine suddenly failed. Woodall was given a two-year sentence, wholly suspended - which means he will remain free as long as he complies with certain conditions. The three-day trial in the Brisbane District Court was shown footage filmed by one of the three passengers inside the plane, which captured the moment the engine stopped and Woodall sharply turned the plane to the left. The Cessna 172N then rapidly lost altitude, before a wing hit the sand and it rolled. Ms Spurway suffered fatal spinal injuries, and her friend Ms O'Dowd was left with a traumatic brain injury and a series of fractures. Woodall also sustained serious injuries, and a 13-year-old boy who was on board suffered a broken ankle. Prosecutors argued it was not the engine failure that caused the crash, but rather Woodall's response to it. Aviation experts who gave evidence during the trial agreed that Woodall, an experienced pilot, went against flight training and best practice. He should have kept the wings level in order to glide and safely land, they said. However Woodall's defence team argued he had little other options available to him in a highly stressful situation. In a 2019 police interview played to the court he told officers he was trying to reach a sandbank, according to reports by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. ""I decided not to land in the water as it was deep, and I was concerned about the risks of drowning and the risk of bull sharks,"" the pilot said. ""I truly believe I did everything I could to ensure the safety of those on board."""

The 29-year-old, whose real name is Andrés Felipe Valencia Barrientos, is accused by police of driving past a speed camera at 158km/h (98mph) on a Perth highway last month. It is alleged to have occurred whilst Barrientos was on bail over an alleged attack on a woman in a Perth hotel in September. The BBC has contacted Barrientos's representatives for comment. When approached for comment, police said they were unable to confirm the charges by name but said a 29-year-old man had been charged with reckless driving. Police say the speeding incident happened on 17 November, in the High Wycombe area of Perth, where the speed limit is 100km/h, and his car was impounded. Barrientos will appear in court accused of reckless driving on 19 December, where he will also appear over four counts of sexual penetration without consent, three counts of assault occasioning bodily harm, and one count of impeding a person's normal breathing or circulation by applying pressure on or to their neck. It is alleged Barrientos brought a woman in her 20s back to his hotel room after he had performed at the nightclub Bar1 in Perth. The rapper was on tour in Australia performing his music. Barrientos is best known for his work with the YouTube collective Beta Squad and has presented shows on BBC Three.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyj6dd1zdro,Children as young as 10 will face adult jail time in Australian state,2024-12-12T09:40:40.470Z,Hannah Ritchie,"The Australian state of Queensland has passed laws which will see children as young as 10 subject to the same penalties as adults if convicted of crimes such as murder, serious assault and break-ins. The government says the harsher sentencing rules are in response to ""community outrage over crimes being perpetrated by young offenders"" and will act as a deterrent. But many experts have pointed to research showing that tougher penalties do not reduce youth offending, and can in fact exacerbate it. The United Nations has also criticised the reforms, arguing they disregard conventions on the human rights of children and violate international law. The Liberal National Party (LNP) - which won the state election in October - made the rules a hallmark of its campaign, saying they put the ""rights of victims"" ahead of ""the rights of criminals"". ""These laws are for every Queenslander who has ever felt unsafe and been a victim of youth crime across our state,"" Premier David Crisafulli said after parliament passed the bill on Thursday. Leading up to the vote, both sides of politics had claimed that Queensland was in the grips of a youth crime wave, and that a more punitive approach was necessary to combat the issue. But data from the Australian bureau of statistics, shows that youth crime has halved in Queensland across the past 14 years, that it hit its lowest rate in recorded history in 2022, and has remained relatively steady since. Figures from the Queensland Police Service and the Australian Institute of Criminology also demonstrate a clear downward trend. Dubbed by the government as ""adult crime, adult time"", the new laws list 13 offences which will now be subject to harsher prison sentences when committed by youths, including mandatory life detention for murder, with a non-parole period of 20 years. Previously, the maximum penalty for young offenders convicted of murder was 10 years in jail, with life imprisonment only considered if the crime was ""particularly heinous"". The laws also remove ""detention as a last resort"" provisions - which favour non-custodial orders, such as fines or community service, for children rather than incarceration - and will make it possible for judges to consider a child's full criminal history when sentencing. The Queensland Police Union has called the changes ""a leap forward in the right direction"", while Queensland's new Attorney-General Deb Frecklington says it will give courts the ability to ""better address patterns of offending"" and ""hold people accountable for their actions"". But in a summary, Frecklington also noted the changes were in direct conflict with international standards, that Indigenous children would be disproportionately impacted and that more youngsters were likely to be held in police cells for extended periods because detention centres are full. Queensland already has more children in detention than any other Australian state or territory. Premier Crisafulli said on Thursday that although there may be ""pressure in the short-term"" his government had a long-term plan to ""deliver a raft of other detention facilities and different options"". Australia's commissioner for children, Anne Hollonds, described the changes as an ""international embarrassment"". She also accused Queensland's government of ""ignoring evidence"" which suggests ""the younger a child comes into contact with the justice system, the more likely it is that they will continue to commit more serious crimes"". ""The fact that [the bill's] provisions are targeting our most at-risk children makes this retreat from human rights even more shocking,"" she said in a statement on Wednesday. Other legal experts, who gave evidence to a parliamentary hearing on the bill last week, said the laws could have unintended consequences for victims, with children being less likely to plead guilty given the tougher sentences, resulting in more trials and longer court delays.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62zgemkexdo,Australia turns to rugby to curb China influence in PNG,2024-12-12T07:56:13.683Z,Tiffanie Turnbull,"Papua New Guinea (PNG) will join Australia's national rugby league competition, after signing a deal that obligates them to shun security ties with China. The Pacific nation has produced many stars of Australia's National Rugby League (NRL) and has long been lobbying to join the franchise. Australia will provide A$600m (£301m, $384m) over ten years to set up the team – which will be based in Port Moresby and compete from 2028 – and help develop the game at a grassroots level across the Pacific region. In exchange, PNG signed a separate pact which it says reaffirms its commitment to Australia as its major security partner. The precise terms of the dual deals are confidential, but the BBC understands they allow Australia to withdraw funding if PNG enters a security agreement with a nation outside the so-called ""Pacific family"". That term is widely accepted to exclude China, despite Beijing's efforts to gain a foothold in the region. If Canberra pulls out, the NRL is then obligated to drop the PNG team. Announcing the agreement in Sydney on Thursday, PNG Prime Minister James Marape said it was a ""monumental"" opportunity for his country, and one aimed at fostering ""unity"" - not only between the 830 language groups in PNG, but also between the nation at large and its closest neighbour. ""For us, it's not just sport and sport commerce, it is [about]... uniting the most diverse nation on the face of planet Earth and also uniting PNG-Australia together in ways that matter most, people to people,"" he told reporters. Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese declared it was a ""great day"" for both countries, and said PNG - the only country in the world where rugby league is the national sport - ""deserves"" a spot in the league. ""The new team will belong to the people of Papua New Guinea… And I know it will have millions of proud fans barracking for it from day one,"" Albanese said. It is a big milestone for the NRL too. This is the first time the competition, which is trying to lure international audiences, has expanded overseas. The only other foreign team, the New Zealand Warriors, has been a part of the competition since its inception almost three decades ago. NRL boss Peter V'landys had been championing the PNG bid, arguing it was a huge opportunity for the league, as well as for PNG's economic development. A name and uniform for the new team will be decided at a later point. Stuart Murray, an Associate Professor of International Relations, told the BBC that while Australia's use of sport as a diplomatic strategy is nothing new, this agreement is unprecedented. The country has over the past decade been ""thinking innovatively about how you can marry sport with policy to counter classical security threats"" said Dr Murray, from Bond University. In this case, he added, ""the scale, the size, the scope and the funding, and the fact that it's being endorsed at such a high level with both prime ministers - that's never been done before"". ""Basically, through this one channel, we will open up 20 or 30 other channels - for business, trade, policing, educational exchange, gender work, climate change... I think it is fantastic."" Australia and China have each been vying for greater influence in the Pacific in recent years. After Beijing inked a major policing deal with the Solomon Islands in 2022, Australia has spent years trying to forge exclusive security pacts with countries across the region – including a policing agreement with Tuvalu last year, and a treaty with Nauru unveiled earlier this week. Some have lauded the pact with PNG - which declared independence from Australia in 1975 - as another major strategic win for Australia. ""Over the past couple of years, with the heightened geopolitical interest and engagement in the Pacific, something a lot of other middle powers and major powers have struggled to do is to get PNG on a deal of exclusivity for security partnerships,"" said Oliver Nobetau, a PNG government lawyer turned policy analyst at the Lowy Institute think tank. Both prime ministers have sought to downplay the security aspect of the deals, framing them instead as a boon to what Mr Nobetau says has been a ""thinning"" relationship between the two countries. Marape made a point to say the agreement ""doesn't stop us from relating with any nation, especially our Asian neighbours"". ""We relate with China, for instance, a great trading partner, a great bilateral partner,"" he said. ""But in security, closer to home… our shared territory needs to be protected, defended, policed… together."" Government sources say the deals do not give Australia veto power over PNG security agreements. But their framing does have the effect of eliminating almost every other potential partner - and Mr Nobetau said the announcement could be seen by some in PNG as ""an exertion of Australian power over PNG sovereignty"". Both he and Dr Murray also note, however, that the dual deals speak to an emerging ""transactional"" dynamic in Pacific relations. ""People that talk about goodwill and who say sport and politics don't mix, that's the 20th century view,"" Dr Murray said. ""For us, there's no way we're going to give away one of our prize cultural assets for nothing. That doesn't happen in diplomacy."" Dr Murray and Mr Nobetau also both agree that the deals mark a significant moment in bilateral relations between the two countries - and are a likely indicator of how Australia is going to continue to pursue its agenda across the region. ""China puts in a lot of money into sport infrastructure… which is sort of what China is good at… [but] China is not going to be offering any alternatives in this space,"" Mr Nobetau said. ""It's something that other countries can't do,"" Dr Murray added. ""We need to use it, especially in a very, very contested region such as the Pacific."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4pvgjklevo,Australia to force tech giants to keep paying for news,2024-12-12T06:13:53.742Z,Hannah Ritchie,"Australia's government says it will create new rules to force big tech companies to pay local publishers for news. The long-awaited decision sets out a successor to a world-first law that Australia passed in 2021, which was designed to make giants like Meta and Google pay for hosting news on their platforms. Earlier this year Meta - which owns Facebook and Instagram - announced it would not renew payment deals it had in place with Australian news organisations, setting up a standoff with lawmakers. The new rules, announced on Thursday, will require firms that earn more than A$250m ($160m; £125m) in annual revenue to enter into commercial deals with media organisations, or risk being hit with higher taxes. The design of the scheme is yet to be finalised but it will apply to sites such as Facebook, Google and TikTok. In a statement, Meta said it was concerned that the government was ""charging one industry to subsidise another"". Unlike the previous model, the new framework - called the News Bargaining Incentive - will require tech firms to pay even if they do not enter deals with publishers. ""Digital platforms receive huge financial benefits from Australia and they have a social and economic responsibility to contribute to Australians' access to quality journalism,"" Assistant Treasurer Stephen Jones said on Thursday. The previous News Media Bargaining Code saw news organisations negotiate commercial deals with tech giants, while also committing firms like Facebook and Google to invest millions of dollars in local digital content. That code aimed to address what the government called a power imbalance between publishers and tech companies, while offsetting some of the losses traditional media outlets have faced due to the rise of digital platforms. As deals brokered under that arrangement neared expiry, Meta said that it would not be renewing them, leading to a roughly A$200m loss in revenue for Australian publishers. Instead, Meta said it would phase out its dedicated news tab - which spotlights articles - on Facebook in Australia, and reinvest the money elsewhere. ""We know that people don't come to Facebook for news and political content… news makes up less than 3% of what people around the world see in their Facebook feed,"" it said in a statement in February. The announcement prompted a strong response from Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's government, which described the move as ""a fundamental dereliction"" of Meta's ""responsibility to its Australian users"". ""The risk is that misinformation will fill any vacuum created by news no longer being on the platform,"" Communications Minister Michelle Rowland said at the time. The new taxation model begins in January 2025 and will be cemented into law once parliament returns in February. The government says it will be designed to make tech companies fund Australian journalism in exchange for tax offsets, not to raise revenue."

The incident has been condemned by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as a ""hate crime"". He told ABC News: ""There's no place for antisemitism in this country, or anywhere for that matter."" It comes days after a fire engulfed a synagogue in Melbourne, causing minor injuries to one man, in what police there are treating as a probable terror attack. Authorities in Sydney said they were seeking two people aged between 15 and 20 over the vandalism incident. The pair had been wearing ""face coverings and dark clothing"" and were seen running from the scene, New South Wales Police said. ""We need public assistance to come forward and help identify those two people,"" Commissioner Karen Webb told reporters. Police said the car blaze was extinguished shortly after firefighters were called to the scene in Woollahra, a suburb in Sydney's east, at around 01:00 local time (14:00 GMT). Anti-Israel messages, including ""Kill Israiel"" [sic], were found at the scene, scrawled on the fence of two properties and cars. The vehicle that was set on fire had been driven to the scene by the suspects, police said. Albanese said he had spoken to the Australian Federal Police (AFP) about the vandalism. Earlier this week, the law enforcement body established a special taskforce to investigate incidents of antisemitism, including the alleged terror attack in Melbourne, and another vandalism spree that occurred in Woollahra last month. Police do not believe the two incidents in Woollahra are linked. New South Wales Premier Chris Minns said the latest incident appeared to have been ""specifically designed"" to ""intimidate the Jewish community in Sydney"". ""If the question is can we do more? I think the answer is yes, and I'm not closing the door to changes to the law,"" he told reporters, adding that he had spoken with Israel's Ambassador to Australia Amir Maimon. The president of the NSW Jewish Board of Deputies, David Ossip, said his community was ""deeply saddened"" by what had happened, but that they would ""not be cowed""."

Hoskins died in hospital on 30 December 2023, after being struck by a vehicle being driven by Dennis outside their home in Adelaide. The 34-year-old was initially charged with dangerous driving causing death and driving without due care, but on Tuesday he admitted a lesser charge - one aggravated count of creating the likelihood of harm. Dennis - who has two children with Hoskins - will be sentenced at a later date. Few details are known about the circumstances leading up to Hoskins's death. However, Dennis's guilty plea means he has admitted to driving a car when Hoskins was in close proximity, knowing that act was likely to cause harm or being recklessly indifferent to whether it would. ""There was no intention of Mr Dennis to harm his wife and this charge does not charge him with responsibility for her death,"" the retired athlete's lawyer told the court. Hoskins was a world champion in the team pursuit in 2015 and a two-time Olympian, and her death triggered a wave of tributes from around the world. She and Dennis married in 2018. Dennis retired at the end of the 2023 season after a career in which he won stages at the Tour de France, Giro d'Italia and Vuelta a Espana. A multiple world champion on both road and track, he won road time trial bronze at the Tokyo 2020 Olympics, having won team pursuit silver at London 2012. He also won a gold medal at the Commonwealth Games in 2022."

Three suspects are being hunted over Friday's early-morning blaze, which left one man with a minor burn to his hand and caused extensive damage. Witnesses say they saw masked figures spreading what appeared to be an accelerant in the building, before setting it alight. Victoria Police say they have no evidence that further antisemitic attacks are planned, but patrols are being increased to reassure the community. After a meeting with Australian Federal Police and domestic spy agency Asio, the state police force said additional ""intelligence"" had led them to conclude the incident should be treated as a probable terror attack. Commissioner Shane Patton said police had no information before the fire to suggest an arson attack was imminent. He declined to provide any further details on the investigation while it continued. Mr Patton's declaration came a day after Prime Minister Anthony Albanese described the incident as ""quite clearly terrorism"" while acknowledging police were still to make up their minds. He called his description a ""personal view"". On Monday, state Premier Jacinta Allan said the terror designation meant police would now have extra resources for their investigation. Jewish community leaders have said they believe the attack is an escalation of a recent documented increase in antisemitism in Australia, and that it has heightened fears of violence. A few worshippers were inside the building at the time of the fire, and have described hearing banging and seeing a window smash, before liquids were thrown inside and lit on fire. ""The whole thing took off pretty quickly,"" synagogue board member Benjamin Klein, who spoke to witnesses, told The Age newspaper. After officers at the scene were confronted by angry and scared worshippers on Friday, Mr Patton said police were focused on ensuring their safety. ""We have... extra police officers deployed in those areas where there are high numbers of Jewish persons living and congregating,"" he said. Allan also called for the city to rally behind its Jewish communities. ""We cannot let this conflict overseas continue to be a cloak for behaviour like [this]."" Albanese also on Monday announced a new federal strikeforce to investigate incidents of antisemitism. The prime minister said a special response was needed to combat the rising threat, pointing to two other recent incidents - the vandalism of a Jewish MP's office and an attack in Sydney in which a car was torched and buildings graffitied."

The show titled 'Raygun: The Musical' was created by Australian comedian Steph Broadbridge, who was also due to feature in the cast. It was due to debut on Saturday at Kinselas in Darlinghurst, Sydney, but Broadbridge was forced to cancel the show after lawyers sent a cease and desist letter, saying that the Olympian owned the dance moves. In a statement to the Guardian, Gunn's legal and management team said it was committed to protecting her intellectual property and ensuring that her brand remained strong and respected. Some of Gunn's unconventional moves - such as the sprinkler and kangaroo-hop - went viral after her Olympics performance. Now, Gunn's lawyers have reportedly trademarked the poster for the musical and advised Broadbridge that she was ""not allowed"" to do the kangaroo dance because Gunn ""owns"" it. ""That one did puzzle me - I mean, that's an Olympic-level dance,"" Broadbridge said in her Instagram video. ""How would I possibly be able to do that without any formal breakdancing training?"" Broadbridge said on Instagram that she planned for the show to be ""back soon"" and ""with a whole new story arc"". Everyone who was due to attend the trial show would be offered a refund for their A$10 ticket, she added. She said: ""They [Gunn's legal team] were worried I was damaging her brand, which I would never."" Gunn failed to receive a single point from judges at this summer's Olympic games and was subsequently eliminated from the round-robin stage which led to a torrent of abuse online. Despite being defended by officials, her performance divided opinion within the breaking community, with some saying she made a mockery of the scene. Gunn had initially planned to keep competing after the Olympics, but in November said the saga had been so ""upsetting"" that she changed her mind and had decided to retire. She ended her video saying that she intends to change the name of her character to ""Raygun with an I"" in hopes that ""fixes everyone's concerns"". In their statement to The Guardian, Gunn's legal team said: ""While we have immense respect for the credible work and effort that has gone into the development of the show, we must take necessary steps to safeguard Rachael's creative rights and the integrity of her work. ""This action is not intended to diminish the contributions of others, but rather to ensure her brand is properly represented and protected in all future endeavours."""

Firefighters were called to Melbourne's Adass Israel synagogue just after 04:00 local time on Friday (17:00 GMT Thursday) and arrived to find the building fully ablaze. Community leaders told local media that ""a few people"" were inside at the time for morning prayers, and they had reported seeing firebombs thrown. One person was injured and the fire caused extensive damage. Police say they believe the fire was deliberately lit but are keeping an ""open mind"" on a motive. In a statement, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the incident in Ripponlea, in the city's south-east, was ""clearly aimed at creating fear in the community"". ""This violence and intimidation and destruction at a place of worship is an outrage,"" he wrote. ""I have zero tolerance for antisemitism."" He added that he had been briefed by the Australian Federal Police, who would provide support to authorities in the state of Victoria. ""The people involved must be caught and face the full force of the law."" Victoria Police said the exact cause of the fire had not yet been determined and an arson chemist would visit the site. However Det Insp Chris Murray said a witness had told them two people in masks appeared to have spread accelerant inside the building. ""We believe it was deliberate. We believe it has been targeted,"" he added. ""What we don't know is why."" He appealed for anyone who may have witnessed the incident, or who may have CCTV or dashcam footage from the local area, to contact police. Synagogue board member Benjamin Klein told The Age newspaper that people inside ""heard banging on the door and the window, and some liquids came through which were lit"". ""The whole thing took off pretty quickly,"" he said. A man who was inside at the time, Yumi Friedman, added that a window had been smashed, sending ""glass flying"". Mr Friedman told reporters his hand was burned on a door knob when he tried to return to the synagogue to fight the blaze. Det Insp Murray - who was confronted by an angry worshipper while updating the press - said police would be committing significant resources to the investigation and increasing patrols around the area. ""We're going to do our best to make sure that they can return, as they should, to their local synagogues, doing what is absolutely Australian - that is to be able to worship without fear."" Jewish community leaders have said they believe the attack is an escalation of a recent documented increase in antisemitism in Australia. ""None of the Jewish community is surprised.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8y4zxred7o,Australian suspect in 1977 murders extradited from Italy,2024-12-03T14:15:26.368Z,Tiffanie Turnbull,"A man wanted over one of Australia's most infamous cold cases, dubbed the Easey Street murders, has arrived in Melbourne after being extradited from Italy. Suzanne Armstrong, 27, and Susan Bartlett, 28, were stabbed to death in their Melbourne house in 1977, in a case which has gripped the nation ever since. Police said suspect Perry Kouroumblis, 65, only became the focus of their investigation in recent years after DNA testing breakthroughs. Mr Kouroumblis - who has not been charged and maintains his innocence - was detained in Italy in September. If charged, he is expected to face court later this week, according to local media. Mr Kouroumblis first came to police attention the week after the murders, when the then 17-year-old said he had found a bloodied knife near the scene in Easey Street, Collingwood, an inner-city suburb. The bodies of the high school friends were discovered three days after they were last seen alive. Ms Armstrong's one-year-old son was also found in the home, unharmed in his cot. Both women had been stabbed more than a dozen times and Ms Armstrong had been sexually assaulted, police say. The case has long drawn huge interest - becoming the subject of major police appeals, true crime books and a hit podcast. In 2017 Victoria Police offered a A$1m (£511,800, $647,600) reward for information. Commissioner Shane Patton described the murders as ""an absolutely gruesome, horrific, frenzied homicide"" when announcing the arrest of Mr Kouroumblis - a dual Greek-Australian citizen - in Rome in September. ""This was a crime that struck at the heart of our community - two women in their own home, where they should have felt their safest,"" he said. Police had issued an Interpol red notice for Mr Kouroumblis on two charges of murder and one of rape, after he left Australia about seven years ago. But he was not able to be arrested in Greece, where he had been living, as the country's law requires murder charges to be laid within 20 years of an alleged crime. At the time of Mr Kouroumblis's arrest, the women's families released a statement, saying their lives had been changed ""irrevocably"" by the murders. ""For two quiet families from country Victoria it has always been impossible to comprehend the needless and violent manner in which Suzanne and Susan died,"" the statement read. Addressing police, they said: ""For always giving us hope and never giving up, we simply say, thank you.""  "

Eleven men and two juveniles were arrested, including the vessel's crew and others waiting on the shore to collect the illegal shipment. The drugs had an estimated street value of A$760m ($490m; £388m), with the potential to be distributed across 11.7 million separate street deals - making it the largest cocaine bust in Australian history. The Australian Federal Police (AFP) alleged one of the men arrested on Saturday night was vice-president of the Comanchero outlaw motorcycle club’s Brisbane chapter. Biker gangs are notorious in Australia for their drug violence, with more than 1,000 shootings recorded since the 1980s. This recent cocaine bust came as part of a wider investigation into the Comanchero gang, codenamed Operation Tyrrendor, which began last month. Authorities said they received intelligence suggesting a criminal syndicate with links to the gang was planning to import illegal drugs into Australia. This comes after reports last week that the Colombian navy intercepted a semi-submersible carrying cocaine to Australia. Investigators told reporters in Brisbane the record cocaine shipment had come from an unidentified South American country. The AFP worked with the Queensland Police Service (QPS) and the Australian Border Force (ABF) to track a fishing boat, recently purchased by a 35-year-old man. On Saturday night, it was being used to transport the cocaine delivery from a larger mothership to the Queensland coast when it suffered a mechanical fault, police said. Stranded about 18km from the north-eastern tip of K'gari, it was intercepted by the AFP and QPS, who found 51 bales of cocaine tied with rope netting. Two men were arrested on the boat and two others were arrested on the coast while waiting for the shipment. A further three arrests were made at a nearby fast-food restaurant, with five others at a traffic stop. The final arrest was made in Brisbane after the AFP and QPS executed a search warrant. All 11 men and two juveniles were were charged with conspiracy to import a commercial quantity of cocaine, which carries a maximum penalty of life imprisonment."

The woman told officers she had been driving at 80km/h (50mph) on the Monash freeway when she felt something on her foot. Melbourne Snake Control were called in to retrieve the animal, which was identified as a tiger snake, one of the world's most venomous reptiles. The driver was taken to hospital as a precaution, but appears to have escaped unharmed, according to paramedics. ""Remarkably, she was able to fend the snake off her and weave through traffic before pulling over and leaping out of her car to safety"", Victoria Police said. Officers said she had been ""rattled"" and ""in a state of shock"". Passing drivers were ""left in bewilderment"" as the snake was pulled out of the car, police added; Tim Nanninga from Melbourne Snake Control said some in traffic started to video the removal. He told ABC News he released the snake back into the wild ""well away from houses, people and pets""."

The 33-year-old, who has taken 278 wickets in 71 Tests, will remain with Australia's squad in Adelaide to prepare for the remainder of the series. Hazlewood was the pick of Australia's bowlers in the first innings of the first Test when he finished with figures of 4-29 as India were dismissed for 150. His place in the side for the second Test which starts on 6 December is widely expected to go to experienced seamer Scott Boland.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gznvw3wneo,Childcare worker who abused more than 60 girls jailed for life,2024-11-29T05:26:47.876Z,Tiffanie Turnbull,"A former childcare worker dubbed ""one of Australia's worst paedophiles"" has been sentenced to life in prison for raping and sexually abusing almost 70 girls. Ashley Paul Griffith, 47, confessed to 307 offences committed at childcare centres in the Australian state of Queensland and overseas between 2003 and 2022. His victims were aged between one and seven. Judge Paul Smith called the scale and nature of the crimes ""depraved"" and ""horrendous"", saying ""there was a significant breach of trust"". In addition to this case, the BBC understands Griffith is separately accused of abusing at least two dozen children in the Australian state of New South Wales and in Italy. In the Brisbane District Court on Friday, Judge Smith said Griffith - who the court heard had a ""paedophilic disorder"" - had a high risk of reoffending, ordering a non-parole period of at least 27 years. Griffith was first arrested in August 2022 by the Australian Federal Police, and a year later charged with more than 1,600 child sex offences. Most of these were eventually dropped. Warning: This story contains details readers might find distressing Investigators found thousands of photographs and videos of his abuse, which he had filmed and uploaded onto the dark web. Although faces were cropped out of the footage, they managed to trace them to Griffith because of a unique set of bedsheets seen in the background of some of the videos, which had been sold to childcare centres across Queensland. He pleaded guilty to 28 counts of rape, almost 200 charges relating to indecent treatment of a child, and several related to making and sharing child exploitation material. Four of the girls who featured in his videos were from a childcare centre in Pisa, Italy. His other 65 victims were from 11 locations across Brisbane. Ahead of his sentence behind handed down, the court heard a string of emotional statements from some of those victims and their parents - who cannot be identified for legal reasons. Among them were two sisters who were abused in kindergarten, one of whom recalled Griffith being her favourite teacher. ""To find out what he was really doing was devastating... I don’t seem to be able to process it even now, because there’s a disconnect between what I remember and the reality,"" she said, according to The Courier Mail. Another woman told how his actions had robbed her of a normal childhood, recounting her struggles with mental illness in the years since. ""I will never know what my life could have been like,"" she is quoted as saying, in an article by The Guardian Australia. ""I can never know what it would have been to grow up unafraid of people."" Parents meanwhile told the court of their horror upon discovering the crimes inflicted upon their children, with several saying they struggled to forgive themselves for trusting Griffith. ""(My daughter) loved you like an uncle and you used her like a toy,"" one said, according to News Corp Australia. Another explained how she was trying to keep the burden of knowledge of the abuse from her daughter. ""I cannot undo what you did to her body but will do everything I can to limit the damage to her mind,"" she said, according to the Courier Mail. Outside court, the families called for an investigation into the childcare centres - and broader system - in which Griffith was able to go undetected for so long. ""Parents are walking their children into these centres today with a false sense of security,"" one father told reporters."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89vjj0lxx9o,Australia approves social media ban on under-16s,2024-11-28T23:31:04.804Z,Hannah Ritchie,"Australia will ban children under 16 from using social media, after its parliament approved the world's strictest laws. The ban, which will not take effect for at least 12 months, could see tech companies fined up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7m) if they don't comply. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese says the legislation is needed to protect young people from the ""harms"" of social media, something many parent groups have echoed. But critics say questions over how the ban will work - and its impact on privacy and social connection - have been left unanswered. This is not the first attempt globally to restrict children's social media use, but the minimum age of 16 is the highest set by any country. Unlike other attempts, it also does not include exemptions for existing users or those with parental consent. Having passed the Senate by 34 votes to 19 late on Thursday, the bill returned to the House of Representatives where it passed early on Friday. “We want our kids to have a childhood and parents to know we have their backs,"" Albanese told reporters afterwards. The legislation does not specify which platforms will be banned. Those decisions will be made later by Australia’s communications minister, who will seek advice from the eSafety Commissioner - an internet regulator that will enforce the rules. However the minister, Michelle Rowland, has said the ban will include Snapchat, TikTok, Facebook, Instagram and X. Gaming and messaging platforms are exempt, as are sites that can be accessed without an account, meaning YouTube, for instance, is likely to be spared. The government says will it rely on some form of age-verification technology to implement the restrictions, and options will be tested in the coming months. The onus will be on the social media platforms to add these processes themselves. However digital researchers have warned there are no guarantees the unspecified technology - which could rely on biometrics or identity information - will work. Critics have also sought assurances that privacy will be protected. They have also warned that restrictions could easily be circumvented through tools like a VPN - which can disguise a user’s location and make them appear to be logging on from another country. Children who find ways to flout the rules will not face penalties, however. Polling on the reforms, though limited, suggests it is supported by a majority of Australian parents and caregivers. ""For too long parents have had this impossible choice between giving in and getting their child an addictive device or seeing their child isolated and feeling left out,"" Amy Friedlander, who was among those lobbying for the ban, recently told the BBC. ""We’ve been trapped in a norm that no one wants to be a part of."" But many experts say the ban is ""too blunt an instrument"" to effectively address the risks associated with social media use, and have warned it could end up pushing children into less regulated corners of the internet. During a short consultation period before the bill passed, Google and Snap criticised the legislation for not providing more detail, and Meta said the bill would be ""ineffective"" and not meet its stated aim of making kids safer. In its submission, TikTok said the government’s definition of a social media platform was so ""broad and unclear"" that ""almost every online service could fall within [it]"". X questioned the ""lawfulness"" of the bill - saying it may not be compatible with international regulations and human rights treaties which Australia has signed. Some youth advocates also accused the government of not fully understanding the role social media plays in their lives, and locking them out of the debate. ""We understand we are vulnerable to the risks and negative impacts of social media… but we need to be involved in developing solutions,"" wrote the eSafety Youth Council, which advises the regulator. Albanese has acknowledged the debate is complex but steadfastly defended the bill. ""We don't argue that its implementation will be perfect, just like the alcohol ban for [children] under 18 doesn’t mean that someone under 18 never has access – but we know that it’s the right thing to do,"" he said on Friday. Last year, France introduced legislation to block social media access for children under 15 without parental consent, though research indicates almost half of users were able to avoid the ban using a VPN. A law in the US state of Utah - which was similar to Australia’s - was overturned by a federal judge who found it unconstitutional. Australia’s laws are being watched with great interest by global leaders. Norway has recently pledged to follow in the country’s footsteps, and last week the UK’s technology secretary said a similar ban was “on the table” - though he later added “not... at the moment”.

The 30-year-old, who was player of the year in the Sheffield Shield last season, will join the national team for the match which starts on 6 December. Webster averages 38 with the bat in first-class cricket and 37 with the ball. He will provide cover for Mitchell Marsh, who is struggling for fitness following Australia's defeat in the first Test in Perth. The Tasmanian, who bowls mostly seam but can also deliver off-spin, joins an otherwise unchanged squad as the home side look to square the five-match series. He scored 61 and 49 batting for Tasmania against New South Wales this week, taking five wickets with the ball. Earlier this month he scored 145 runs in two matches against India A, along with taking seven wickets at an average of 19.57. BBC Sport has ball by ball commentary of India's tour of Australia, plus highlights by CricViz analyst Ben Jones While few Australians have been banging the door down domestically, Webster has impressed. In the last four editions of the Sheffield Shield he’s the fourth leading run scorer, and is the only batter to average in excess of 50 having played at least 10 matches. While spinners do tend to find life difficult in Australia, Webster’s recent record against them - an average of 172 in the last four years - is exceptional. He’s a tall man and loves to pull (average 94) and cut (average 200) the quicks. Webster could also relieve the pressure that’s been placed on Australia’s fifth bowler Mitchell Marsh, who continues to struggle with his fitness. He often comes on first change for Tasmania, and in the 2023-24 Sheffield Shield season took 30 wickets at an average of 29, with an unusual mix of seam up and spin deliveries. County fans may also be familiar with Webster from a brief stint with Gloucestershire last season, where he averaged 58 with the bat from four County Championship matches, and took a tidy 16 wickets at 21.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yp7g9r8j5o,Officer who Tasered 95-year-old guilty of manslaughter,2024-11-27T05:52:38.371Z,Tiffanie Turnbull,"A police officer who Tasered a 95-year-old woman with dementia symptoms at an Australian care home has been found guilty of her manslaughter. Kristian White, 34, used his weapon on Clare Nowland after the great-grandmother was found wandering with a small kitchen knife in the early hours of 17 May 2023. Her death a week later caused public outcry, but White - a senior constable - argued at trial that his use of force was reasonable and proportionate to the threat. Prosecutors, however, said Mrs Nowland - who relied on a walker to get around and weighed under 48kg (105lb) - was not a danger and that the ""impatient"" officer had neglected his duty of care to her. Police and paramedics were called to Yallambee Lodge - in the town of Cooma about 114km (71 miles) south of Canberra – around 04:00 on the day of the incident, after Mrs Nowland had been seen roaming the care home with two serrated steak knives. The trial in the New South Wales (NSW) Supreme Court heard that Mrs Nowland, while not formally diagnosed with dementia, had been displaying signs of cognitive decline in the months leading up to her death and had at times behaved aggressively towards healthcare workers. At one point that night she had entered the room of another resident holding the knives, though he told the court he did not feel unsafe, and she had also later thrown one of the blades at a staff member. When emergency services found Mrs Nowland, they repeatedly asked her to drop the knife in her right hand, and – using thick gloves – had tried to disarm her themselves, the court was told. In the moments before she was hit by the Taser, footage played to the jury showed the elderly woman using her walker to slowly shuffle forward - 1m (3.3ft) over the course of a minute - before stopping and raising the blade. White warned Mrs Nowland his weapon was aimed at her, before saying ""bugger it"" and firing it, while she was still 1.5m-2m away. She fell and hit her head, triggering a fatal brain bleed. “Who could she have injured at that moment? No one,” Crown prosecutor Brett Hatfield said, summing up his case for the jury last week. He said White had used his weapon only three minutes after finding the woman: “He was fed up, impatient, not prepared to wait any longer.” However in a written incident report, the officer - who had been stood down from duties while facing court - said he deployed his Taser because he felt a “violent confrontation was imminent”. In court he added that he didn’t think Mrs Nowland would be “significantly injured” and that he was “devastated” by her death. The defence pointed to evidence from one of the paramedics and White’s police partner, who both said Mrs Nowland had made them feel scared for their safety. ""I thought that I was going to be stabbed,” Jessica Pank, also a senior constable, said. However, both agreed they could have easily moved to safety, given Mrs Nowland’s limited mobility. Mrs Nowland's family, who were in court to hear the jury's verdict, thanked prosecutors, the judge and the jury. ""The family will take some time to come to terms with the jury’s confirmation that Clare’s death at the hands of a serving NSW police officer was a criminal and unjustified act,"" they said in a statement issued by a lawyer, which also asked for privacy. NSW Police Commissioner Karen Webb on Wednesday said White's employment was still under legal review. She added that the force's Taser policies and training had also been reviewed but found to be appropriate. ""The death of Clare Nowland is a terrible tragedy... this should never have happened,"" she said. White, who remains on bail, will be sentenced at a later date."
https://www.bbc.com/sport/cricket/articles/c9wr4j18kego,How individual toll of Hughes' death still haunts Australia,2024-11-25T16:32:07.663Z,,"Warning: Some people may find this article upsetting. For help and support dealing with grief, please visit the BBC Action Line At some point in the previous year, for a lot of people who follow cricket, the thought would have come up. Late November in the last nine years has included moments of remembrance for Phillip Hughes, Australia's prodigy who died after being struck on the neck by a ball while batting in the Sheffield Shield in 2014, trying to make a score to get back into the Test team. This year marks a decade since that loss. In grief, milestones are everywhere. The ones that surprise us are marked in space, things we stumble into like low furniture. Here's a garden near my old house, and here's me remembering the last time you walked through it. The predictable ones are marked in time. Months at first, then anniversaries, birthdays twinned in the mental calendar with dates of death. Some dates evaporate. Some lodge. So in a world that puts store in anniversaries, this one is significant. And complicated. Hughes' injury happened on 25 November, two days before an official announcement of death. That means there is not exactly an anniversary, but more a long weekend of mourning. For those three days in the cricket world you are acutely aware of the sensitivity. This coming week or two his story will feature heavily. The Perth Test, which finished on Monday, was never planned to be part of this, given the lack of certainty around an end date. The ceremony instead will happen around the Adelaide Test from 6 December. Hughes' final match was for South Australia, and the tribute Test that followed his death was also against India at Adelaide. Three of those players from a decade ago were still in the team in Perth this week: Nathan Lyon, Steve Smith and Mitchell Marsh. The 2014 Shield match involved three current players - Lyon, Mitchell Starc and Travis Head - as well as commentators Callum Ferguson, David Warner and Brad Haddin. Even now, we probably underestimate the effect on that generation of cricketers. The players at that match had the trauma of being there. Others who were not there still suffered. Peter Siddle played for Victoria but was Hughes' national team-mate. After a Test hat-trick on his birthday in 2010, Siddle had a fun three years of people posting memes about it each year. But his birthday is 25 November. From 2014 the association changed completely, and he later explained in a podcast interview how he became weighed down with sadness whenever someone mentioned his birthday. Glenn Maxwell became a meme, too, when he charged a pace bowler in a Big Bash game before failing to play a shot and being bowled. He was mocked worldwide. Melbourne journalist Ron Reed wrote that it ""looked like the work of a man in a mental meltdown"" and that ""his form has deteriorated alarmingly over the past few weeks"" - but even then nobody joined the dots. It was one month after Hughes had died. Maxwell was an emotional wreck, the two of them close from age-group cricket. Only this year Maxwell explained the context in his book. Until then nobody had asked. Or take Michael Clarke, national captain at the time, close with Hughes from New South Wales cricket, who gave the very public eulogy days before leading his team in the tribute Test. Clarke later said that he should have retired after that match, rather than battling to lead the 2015 World Cup and Ashes campaigns when he was mentally shot. Even for people who did not know Hughes, the 10-year commemoration will be emotional. For so many this is the defining memory of 2014: the intense and spontaneous upswell of sorrow, how astonishing it was to see and share it across Australia and worldwide. The symbolism made sense. Hughes represented youth and vitality, as a 25-year-old sportsman. Potential, as a player of 26 Tests who was tipped to play a hundred more. Injustice, first at the trivial level of his problems with selectors, then the tragic luck of his injury. Talent, that would never get its full display. A prodigy cut short, a smiling kid who was apparently everyone's mate. Losing those things moved people deeply. This year, people will revisit those feelings. The sudden sadness, the surprise. They will see how much time has passed and think about how different they were, their life was, our world was. They will feel that world moving on. Time is supposed to ease grief, but it sharpens it too: time passing means that your time with the person you loved grows further away. That holds its own grief. They recede, you keep moving on a path they can no longer join. This is the part of memory, the one means of keeping somebody with you when your ways have parted. Now and then as you move through your world, it offers ways to remind you, and you listen. "
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4v74drnmo,Kayaker's leg amputated in middle of river after 20-hour rescue,2024-11-23T13:49:21.613Z,Grace Dean,"A tourist in Tasmania has had his leg amputated in the middle of a raging river after getting trapped between rocks during a kayaking trip with friends. Medics said they made the ""life or death"" decision in consultation with the international visitor during a complex rescue on the Franklin River lasting some 20 hours. The visitor in his 60s was partially submerged in water throughout the ordeal, and rescuers said it was clear that ""had he remained in the location where he was, and trapped in the rock crevice he would not have survived"". Multiple attempts to move him prior to the amputation were unsuccessful, police in the Australian island state said. The tourist was kayaking with a group in the south-west of Tasmania when his leg got stuck between rocks in an area of rapids on Friday afternoon. Emergency services rushed to the remote and inaccessible area after the man's smartwatch called for assistance, police said. After a number of unsuccessful attempts were made to free the man overnight and as his condition deteriorated, the decision was made to amputate his leg so he could be winched from the location and airlifted to hospital. ""This rescue was an extremely challenging and technical operation, and an incredible effort over many hours to save the man’s life,” Doug Oosterloo, acting assistant commissioner at Tasmania Police, said in a statement. ""This was a life and death situation,"" Oosterloo told Australian national broadcaster ABC. The man is now in a critical condition in hospital. Oosterloo said that though the kayaker was “well prepared”, he wasn’t prepared for spending ""that significant amount of time in a rock crevice with that temperature and the torrent of water that was he was under”. The other 10 travellers who were kayaking with the man were being airlifted from the area and police plan to speak to them about how the accident happened, the Australian Associated Press reported. Oosterloo told the news agency that the tourists had stopped kayaking and were on the shore when the man slipped. “He was scouting the area and he slipped and fell into that rock crevice,” Oosterloo said."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y5z4j3y2xo,Katy Perry v Katie Perry: Singer wins right to use name in Australia,2024-11-22T08:03:56.142Z,Joel Guinto,"Singer Katy Perry has successfully appealed against a trademark decision over her name, after being sued by an Australian designer who sells clothes under her birth name Katie Perry. Three appeals judges on Friday overturned a court decision last year that favoured Katie Taylor over merchandise sold by the pop star during a 2014 tour of Australia. The judges said Perry had been using her name as a trademark five years before Taylor started her business, adding that by that time, Perry had attained an ""international reputation"" in entertainment. The judges also cancelled Taylor's trademark registration on Friday. Taylor had likened her legal battle with Perry to ""David and Goliath"". She told the Sydney Morning Herald after Friday's ruling that she was ""devastated"" with the case outcome. The appeals judges said it was ""unfortunate"" that the case pitted two enterprising women who used their names as trademarks but were unaware that the other existed. “Both women put blood, sweat and tears into developing their businesses,” the judges said. “As the fame of one grew internationally, the other became aware of her namesake and filed a trademark application,” they said. The judge who ruled in favour of Taylor last year referenced one of Perry's biggest hits in her decision: ""This is a tale of two women, two teenage dreams and one name"". Friday's ruling comes as Perry prepares for her Lifetimes world tour in early 2025 to support her comeback album 143."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl4dyjg57do,Australia wants to ban kids from social media. Will it work?,2024-11-21T04:04:33.360Z,Hannah Ritchie,"“I felt really scared to be honest,” says James, describing an incident on Snapchat that left him questioning whether it was safe to go to school. The Australian boy, 12, had had a disagreement with a friend, and one night before bed the boy added him to a group chat with two older teenagers. Almost instantly, his phone “started blowing up” with a string of violent messages. “One of them sounded like he was probably 17,” James tells the BBC. “He sent me videos of him with a machete… he was waving it around. Then there were voice messages saying that they were going to catch me and stab me.” James - not his real name - first joined Snapchat when he was 10, after a classmate suggested everyone in their friendship group get the app. But after telling his parents about his cyberbullying experience, which was ultimately resolved by his school, James deleted his account. His experience is a cautionary tale that shows why the Australian government’s proposed social media ban on children under 16 is necessary, says his mother Emma, who is also using a pseudonym. The laws, which were tabled in parliament's lower house on Thursday, have been billed by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese as “world-leading”. But while many parents have applauded the move, some experts have questioned whether kids should - or even can - be barred from accessing social media, and what the adverse effects of doing so may be. Albanese says the ban - which will cover platforms such as X, TikTok, Facebook and Instagram - is about protecting kids from the “harms” of social media. ""This is a global problem and we want young Australians essentially to have a childhood. We want parents to have peace of mind,"" he said on Thursday. The new legislation provides a ""framework"" for the ban. But the 17-page document, which is expected to head to the Senate next week, is sparse on detail. Instead, it will be up to the nation’s internet regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to hash out how to implement and enforce the rules, which will not come into effect for at least 12 months after legislation is passed. According to the bill, the ban will apply to all children under 16 and that there will be no exemptions for existing users or those with parental consent. Tech companies will face penalties of up to A$50m ($32.5m; £25.7) if they do not comply, but there will be exemptions for platforms which are able to create “low-risk services"" deemed suitable for kids. Criteria for this threshold are yet to be set. Messaging services and gaming sites, however, will not be restricted, as will some sites that can be accessed without an account like YouTube, which has prompted questions over how regulators will determine what is and isn’t a social media platform in a fast-moving landscape. A group representing the interests of tech companies such as Meta, Snapchat and X in Australia has dismissed the ban as “a 20th Century response to 21st Century challenges”. Such legislation could push kids into “dangerous, unregulated parts of the internet”, Digital Industry Group Inc says - a fear also expressed by some experts. eSafety Commissioner Julie Inman Grant has acknowledged the gargantuan task her office will face when enforcing the ban, given “technology change is always going to outpace policy”. “It will always be fluid, and this is why regulators like eSafety have to be nimble,” she told BBC Radio 5 Live. But Ms Inman Grant has also raised concerns about the central idea behind the government’s policy, which is that there’s a causal link between social media and declining mental health. “I would say that the evidence base is not settled at all,” she said, pointing to research from her own office which found that some of the most vulnerable groups, such as LGBTQ+ or First Nations teenagers, “feel more themselves online than they do in the real world”. This is a sentiment echoed by Lucas Lane, 15, who runs an online business selling nail polish to boys. “This [ban] destroys… my friendships and the ability to make people feel seen,” the Perth teenager tells the BBC. Ms Inman Grant would rather see tech companies clean up their platforms, as well as more investment in education tools to help young people stay safe online. She uses the analogy of teaching children to swim, rather than banning them from the water. “We don’t fence the ocean… but we do create protected swimming environments that provide safeguards and teach important lessons from a young age,” she told parliament earlier this year. But Emma - who has lobbied for the ban through the parent-led Heads Up Alliance - sees it differently. “Should we really be wasting our time trying to help kids navigate these difficult systems when tech companies just want them on them all the time?"" she says. “Or should we just allow them to be kids and learn how to be sociable outside with each other, and then start these discussions later on?” Amy Friedlander, a mother of three from the Wait Mate movement - which encourages parents to delay giving their kids smartphones - agrees. “We can’t ignore all the positives that technology has brought into our lives. There are huge upsides, but what we haven’t really considered is the impact it is having on brains which aren’t ready for it.” Over 100 Australian academics have criticised the ban as ""too blunt an instrument"" and argued that it goes against UN advice which calls on governments to ensure young people have “safe access” to digital environments. It has also failed to win the backing of a bipartisan parliamentary committee that’s been examining the impact of social media on adolescents. Instead, the committee recommended that tech giants face tougher regulations. To address some of those concerns, the government says it will eventually introduce ""digital duty of care"" laws, which will make it a legal obligation for tech companies to prioritise user safety. Joanne Orlando, a researcher in digital behaviour, argues that while a ban “could be part of a strategy, it absolutely can’t be the whole strategy”. She says “the biggest piece of the puzzle” should be educating kids to think critically about the content they see on their feeds and how they use social media. The government has already spent A$6m since 2022 to develop free “digital literacy tools” to try and do just that. However, research suggests that many young Australians aren’t receiving regular lessons. Ms Orlando and other experts warn there are also significant hurdles to making the age-verification technology - which is required to enforce the ban - effective and safe, given the “enormous risks” associated with potentially housing the identification documents of every Australian online. The government has said it is aiming to solve that challenge through age-verification trials, and hopes to table a report by mid-next year. It has promised that privacy concerns will be front and centre, but offered little detail on what kind of technology will actually be tested. In its advice, the eSafety Commissioner has floated the idea of using a third-party service to anonymise a user’s ID before it is passed on to any age verification sites, to “preserve” their privacy. However, Ms Orlando remains sceptical. “I can’t think of any technology that exists at this point that can pull this off,” she tells the BBC. Australia is by no means the first country to try to restrict how young people access certain websites or platforms online. In 2011, South Korea passed its “shutdown law” which prevented children under 16 from playing internet games between 22:30 and 6:00, but the rules - which faced backlash - were later scrapped citing the need to “respect the rights of youths”. More recently France introduced legislation requiring social media platforms to block access to children under 15 without parental consent. Research indicated almost half of users were able to circumvent the ban using a simple VPN. A law in the US state of Utah - which was similar to Australia’s - ran into a different issue: it was blocked by a federal judge who found it unconstitutional. Albanese has conceded that Australia's proposal may not be foolproof, and if it passes the parliament, it would be subject to a review. ""We all know technology moves fast and some people will try to find ways around these new laws but that is not a reason to ignore the responsibility that we have,"" he told lawmakers. But for mothers like Emma and Ms Friedlander - who have lobbied for the changes - it's the message that the ban sends which matters most. “For too long parents have had this impossible choice between giving in and getting their child an addictive device or seeing their child isolated and feeling left out socially,” Ms Friedlander says. “We’ve been trapped in a norm that no one wants to be a part of.” James says that since quitting Snapchat he’s found himself spending more time outside with friends. And he hopes that the new laws could enable more kids like him to “get out and do the things they love” instead of feeling pressured to be online."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gz84jy9ypo,Uncertainty after Australia foreign students bill hits opposition,2024-11-21T00:25:28.211Z,Tiffanie Turnbull,"Australia's debate over capping foreign student numbers is “not over” despite a controversial bill unexpectedly losing support, a top industry body says. The bill, part of efforts to slash overall migration to Australia, had been opposed by most universities who say it would damage the higher education sector and its global reputation. The government argued the legislation was needed to make the industry more sustainable and ease pressure on housing, and it was expected to easily pass with opposition support this week. However in a surprise eleventh-hour move, Australia's opposition leader said his coalition would vote against the bill as it didn't go far enough. Though some universities have expressed support at the bill's apparent demise, they also say it extends the uncertainty surrounding the industry - which is worth about A$50bn (£25.7bn, $32.7bn) to the economy. Luke Sheehy, head of Universities Australia, told the BBC the news brought ""no sense of relief"" for him. ""I just knew that we would be looking at international students [used] as cannon fodder in a phoney war on migration right through to the election now,"" said Mr Sheehy, whose organisation advocates for 39 universities. The cap proposed limiting new enrolments at 270,000 for 2025 - a significant cut on the number in 2024. It had been due to come into effect in just six weeks. Some universities have made job cuts and rejected student applications in anticipation of the new laws, and the BBC was told foreign students were already choosing to study elsewhere as a result of the reduced confidence in the sector. The legislation, currently before the Senate, has not been formally withdrawn by Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's Labor government but it cannot pass without the support of the main opposition Liberal-National coalition or the Greens, who also oppose it. Leader of the Opposition Peter Dutton called the bill ""a dog's breakfast"" and vowed to introduce ""deeper cuts"" if he wins the upcoming election, due by May. The Greens, on the other hand, described the bill ""dog whistling that shamefully scapegoated international students for the housing crisis they did not cause"". The government has accused Mr Dutton of hypocrisy, arguing he has often talked ""tough"" on cutting immigration to the country, which has reached record levels in recent years. The expected failure of the bill would mean an existing visa policy, which has been widely accused of exacerbating problems by funnelling most international students to a select few city-based universities, will remain in place. The Group of Eight (Go8) - a body which represents Australia’s top ranked universities - said the bill would have hurt students and staff and that common sense had prevailed. But the industry has been left scrambling again, with only a few months left until the 2025 academic year begins. Observers say some universities could now receive a spike in students when they had a expected a cut, and others - predominantly in regional locations - will no longer expect as many, putting them under greater financial pressure. ""The most devastating part of this discussion is that we still don't have a resolution,"" Mr Sheehy said. ""We're nowhere closer to providing the certainty, stability and growth the government promised us all those many months ago when they proposed caps."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0memjm3jro,Australian senator censured for heckling King,2024-11-18T10:54:04.126Z,Hannah Ritchie,"Australian lawmakers have voted to censure an Aboriginal senator who heckled King Charles during his visit to Canberra last month, to express their ""profound disapproval"" of her protest. Lidia Thorpe shouted ""you are not my King"" and ""this is not your land"" shortly after the King addressed the Great Hall of Parliament, in an effort to highlight the impacts of British colonisation. The Senate's censure, which passed 46-12, described Thorpe's actions as ""disrespectful and disruptive"" and said they should disqualify her from representing the chamber as a member of any delegation. A censure motion is politically symbolic but carries no constitutional or legal weight. Shortly after the Senate vote on Monday, Thorpe told reporters she had been denied her right to respond in the chamber due to a flight delay. ""The British Crown committed heinous crimes against the first peoples of this country... I will not be silent,"" the independent senator said. Her protest last month drew immediate ire from across the political aisle, as well as from some prominent Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander leaders. But it also drew praise from some activists who argued that it highlighted the plight of Australia's first inhabitants, who endured colonial violence and still face acute disadvantages in terms of health, wealth, education, and life expectancy compared to non-Indigenous Australians. Thorpe is among those who have advocated for a treaty between Australia’s government and its first inhabitants. Unlike New Zealand and other former British colonies, a treaty with Indigenous peoples in Australia was never established. Many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people emphasise that they never ceded their sovereignty or land to the Crown. Despite the protest, the King was warmly greeted by Australian crowds during his five-day tour alongside Queen Camilla. “You have shown great respect for Australians, even during times when we have debated the future of our own constitutional arrangements and the nature of our relationship with the crown. Nothing stands still,"" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said in an official address. Thorpe has a history of Indigenous activism which has, at times, grabbed global headlines. During her swearing in ceremony in 2022, the Gunnai, Gunditjmara and Djab Wurrung woman referred to the Queen Elizabeth II as a coloniser - and was asked to retake her oath after facing criticism. Last year, Australia decisively rejected a proposal to grant Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people constitutional recognition and allow them to establish a body to advise parliament on issues impacting their communities. The referendum - known as the Voice - became ensnared in a bruising campaign, and both sides of politics have sought to move on swiftly, leaving uncertainty over future policy. While the data suggests a majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people voted 'Yes', support wasn’t unanimous. Thorpe herself was a leading ‘No’ campaigner, having criticised the measure as tokenistic."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx27v4v1l5wo,Top radio host charged with sexually abusing eight people,2024-11-18T05:25:50.560Z,Tiffanie Turnbull,"Veteran Australian broadcaster and former Wallabies coach Alan Jones has been charged with sexually abusing seven men and a 17-year-old boy. The 83-year-old was taken into custody at his Sydney apartment early on Monday morning, as detectives from the New South Wales (NSW) Police Child Abuse Squad searched the harbour-front property and seized electronic devices. Mr Jones is one of Australia’s most influential media figures, and has previously denied allegations of abuse, first published by The Sydney Morning Herald in 2023. He now faces 24 charges over alleged incidents between 2001 and 2019, including 11 counts of aggravated indecent assault. All the charges, except two of common assault, are sex offences. Police said some of the alleged victims knew the radio titan personally, and that at least one had been employed by him. Others were allegedly assaulted the first time they met him, NSW Police's Michael Fitzgerald told reporters. ""I wish to commend the victims and their bravery in coming forward. [They] have now got the ability to have a voice. This is what they've been asking for,"" he said. Commissioner Karen Webb earlier said police had conducted a ""very complex"", ""protracted"" and ""thorough"" investigation, and expected other alleged victims may now come forward. ""There's no such thing as a matter that's too old to be investigated,"" she said at a press conference. ""You will be listened to, and we will take your matter seriously."" Mr Jones has been granted conditional bail, and will face court on 18 December. A former teacher, Mr Jones coached Australia's national rugby union team between 1984 and 1988, before pivoting to a radio career. He also, at times, worked as a speechwriter and advisor for Liberal Party figures - including former Prime Minister Malcolm Fraser - and launched several failed bids to represent the party in both state and federal politics. A staple of Sydney airwaves on local station 2GB for decades, Mr Jones juggled those duties with TV commentary gigs before he retired from full time work in 2020 citing health issues. The broadcaster is a polarising figure, for years boasting one of the nation's biggest audiences but often courting controversy. He made headlines in 2012 for suggesting that then-Prime Minister Julia Gillard's father had ""died of shame"", and in 2019 faced a massive advertiser boycott after saying someone should ""shove a sock"" down the throat of New Zealand's leader at the time, Jacinda Ardern. Mr Jones has also been successfully sued for defamation many times."

Bradman wore the cap - known as a 'baggy green' - in the 1947-48 home Test series against India, during which he scored his 100th first-class century. Bradman, who died aged 92 in 2001, is widely regarded as cricket's greatest-ever batter and averaged 99.94 runs across his 52-match Test career. The cap has been on loan since 2010 to the Bradman Museum in the player’s hometown of Bowral. Following the 1947-48 Indian tour, Bradman gave the cap to the Indian team tour manager, Pankaj Gupta, who passed it on to the Indian team's wicket keeper PK Sen. It was purchased by the current owner in 2003, auction house Bonhams said. ""The baggy green has been part of cricket and sporting heritage for decades,"" explained Alex Clark, a senior specialist at Bonhams. ""This very special baggy green promises to have real appeal to followers of cricket and sport generally, and anyone with a keen interest in the history of sport."" It will go on sale at Bonhams Sydney on 3 December."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyvkxdxprlo,"Bondi attacker stabbed 16 in three minutes, inquiry told",2024-11-12T05:17:31.917Z,Hannah Ritchie,"It took just three minutes for Joel Cauchi to fatally stab six people and injure 10 more during a rampage at a popular Sydney shopping centre, an inquest into the attack has been told. The New South Wales Coroner's Court heard on Tuesday that Cauchi, 40, was knife-obsessed and had been diagnosed with schizophrenia, but had come off his medication and was homeless at the time of the incident. The inquiry also heard that no alarm sounded inside the centre until after Cauchi had been shot dead by police. The incident on 13 April devastated Australia, where mass murder is rare, and prompted a national conversation about gendered violence. All up, 14 of the 16 people stabbed that day were female - including five of the six who were killed, and a nine-month-old baby. The NSW police commissioner said at the time that it was ""obvious"" Cauchi had targeted women. Tuesday's hearing laid out the areas of focus for an extensive inquiry which is due to begin in full in April 2025. The investigation will look into possible security lapses and failings in the mental health systems in NSW and Queensland, Cauchi's home state. Speaking in court, Dr Peggy Dwyer SC, the counsel assisting the coroner, said Cauchi had been off his psychotropic medication since 2019, despite authorities being repeatedly warned of his deteriorating state. Cauchi had come ""to the attention"" of Queensland police several times, she added. In her statement, Dwyer also provided the first detailed timeline of how the violence actually unfolded in Bondi that day. She said that Cauchi - who had been sleeping rough in the suburb of Maroubra on the morning of the attack - entered Westfield shopping centre around 15.30 (local), and began stabbing people roughly three minutes later, after removing his knife in line at a bakery. His first victim was Dawn Singleton, 25, followed by 47-year-old Jade Young and 25-year-old Yixuan Cheng. He then attacked Ashlee Good, 38, from behind. Good - who has been described by her family as an ""all-round outstanding human"" - then saw Cauchi stabbing her nine-month-old baby girl in her pram, and was further wounded trying to save the child's life, the court heard. Faraz Tahir, a 30-year-old security guard, was stabbed next, alongside a colleague. Onlookers at the time said he died ""trying to save others"". Cauchi fatally stabbed Pikria Darchia, 55, before being shot dead by NSW Police Insp Amy Scott, who had been on duty close by. Between the moment Insp Scott arrived and the moment she killed Cauchi just over a minute had passed, the court heard. In total, the attack lasted for five minutes and 43 seconds - yet no alarm sounded during that time. ""It’s presently unclear why it took so long for the alarm to sound,"" Dwyer said. Before opening the hearing, state coroner Teresa O’Sullivan acknowledged the pain and loss the broader community was still feeling as a result of the violence. ""I offer my sincere condolences to the family and loved ones who are here in court today as well as those who can’t be here in person,"" she told the court, according to the Guardian Australia. ""It’s important to me and my assisting team… that you feel safe, you feel heard and you feel cared for throughout this proceeding."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg4l3yz76neo,Jamie Oliver pulls 'offensive' children's book from sale,2024-11-11T14:40:06.098Z,Tiffanie Turnbull,"Celebrity chef Jamie Oliver has pulled his new children's book from the shelves after complaints it stereotyped Indigenous Australians. The 400-page fantasy novel, Billy and the Epic Escape, features an Aboriginal girl with mystical powers living in foster care who is abducted from her home in central Australia. First Nations leaders have said the book reproduces ""harmful stereotypes"" and trivialises the ""complex and painful"" history of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children being forcibly removed from their families under government assimilation policies. Oliver - who is in Australia promoting a new cookbook - has apologised and said he was ""devastated"" to have caused hurt. ""It was never my intention to misinterpret this deeply painful issue,"" he said in a statement. Publisher Penguin Random House UK said that a consultation with Indigenous Australians requested by Oliver had not happened due to an ""editorial oversight"". Critics said the book contained language errors and oversimplified the identity of First Nations character Ruby. ""This superficial treatment of Ruby's character dehumanises her, and by extension, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples,"" said Sharon Davis of the First Nations educational body Natsiec. Among the complaints is that Ruby is given the ability to read people’s minds and communicate with animals and plants, because ""that’s the Indigenous way"". Sharon Davis said that reduced ""complex and diverse belief systems"" to ""magic"". The character is also at the centre of an abduction plot, something community leader Sue-Anne Hunter called a ""particularly insensitive choice,"" given the ""painful historical context"" of Australia's Stolen Generations. During the 20th Century, tens of thousands of Indigenous children were removed from their families under official government policies aimed at assimilation which assumed black inferiority and white superiority. This government policy continued officially until the 1970s. ""The story’s flippant approach to narrating the theft of a First Nations child dangerously trivialises the ongoing trauma associated with Australia’s violent history of child removal,"" Natsiec said. They added that today, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children are 10 times more likely non-Indigenous children to be removed from their families into foster care or other systems. Critics have also pointed out language errors in the book. The character is from Mparntwe or Alice Springs in the Northern Territory but uses vocabulary from the language of the Gamilaraay people of the states of New South Wales and Queensland. Sharon Davis said this showed ""complete disregard for the vast differences among First Nations languages, cultures, and practices"". Oliver said he and his publishers had decided to withdraw the book from sale around the world. A statement from Penguin Random House UK added: ""It is clear that our publishing standards fell short on this occasion, and we must learn from that."" Natsiec said it acknowledged and recognised their apologies and ""swift action"" in removing the books from sale."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yx9j94z5ro,Australian soldier awarded Victoria Cross for Vietnam bravery,2024-11-11T03:20:26.548Z,,"An Australian soldier has been posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross - the Commonwealth's highest military honour - for bravery during the Vietnam War. The then 19-year-old Private Richard Norden ran into enemy fire to reach a wounded comrade and retrieve the body of another during a battle north-east of the capital, then known as Saigon, in 1968. He survived the battle but died at the age of 24 in a traffic accident while on duty as a police officer in Canberra More than 60,000 Australians - about a quarter of them conscripted - served in controversial Vietnam War from 1962 to 1973, as part of an allied force led by the US. ""Private Richard Norden is a true Australian hero... [He] demonstrated extraordinary courage and selflessness by putting his own life at risk to save and protect his fellow comrades,"" Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said after the announcement, on Remembrance Day. Pte Norden's company was ambushed by North Vietnamese Army soldiers on 14 May, 1968, with a scout immediately killed and the section Commander gravely injured. Described as having a ""complete disregard for his own personal safety"", he ran forward under heavy enemy fire to reach the two soldiers and carried the severely wounded section Commander back to his group. Himself seriously wounded by that point, Pte Norden then went back for the scout. Finding him dead, he then returned to the group to collect grenades before pushing into the battlefield for a third time, to clear the area so the scout's body could be recovered. Australia's Governor-General Sam Mostyn said it was a ""historic"" day for the country and a ""significant"" moment for Pte Norden's family. ""We are honoured that His Majesty has approved the Victoria Cross for Australia for Richard, recognising his gallantry actions whilst serving in Vietnam,"" his widow, Robynn Freeman said in a statement. A formal ceremony to present the medal to Pte Norden's family will take place at a later date, yet to be announced. Like in many other allied countries, the war was very divisive in Australia and thousands of Australians protested against it. By the time the conflict ended in 1975, an estimated three million Vietnamese people had died, with the US losing over 58,000 people and Australia 521."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c170n974091o,"'Adult crime, adult time': Row as Australian territory locks up 10-year-olds again",2024-11-08T16:23:02.017Z,Katy Watson,"'Thomas' - not his real name - was 13 years old when he began his first stint in prison. Following the sudden death of his father, he had robbed a shop in Australia’s Northern Territory (NT). He was detained for a week but, within a month, he was back in custody for another burglary. Five years on, the Aboriginal teenager has spent far more of that time inside prison than out. “It’s hard changing,” Thomas tells me. “[Breaking the law] is something that you grow up your whole life doing - it’s hard to [stop] the habit.” His story - a revolving door of crime, arrest and release - is not an isolated one in the Northern Territory. For many, over the years the crimes get more serious, the sentences longer and the time spent between prison spells ever briefer. The Northern Territory is the part of Australia with the highest rate of incarceration: more than 1,100 per 100,000 people are behind bars, which is greater than five times the national average. It’s also more than twice the rate of the US, which is the country with the highest number of people behind bars. But the issue of jailing children in particular has been thrust into the spotlight here, after the territory's new government controversially lowered the age of criminal responsibility from 12 back to 10. The move, which defies a UN recommendation, means potentially locking up even more young people. It's not just an issue of incarceration. It's one of inequalities too. While around 30% of the Northern Territory's population is Aboriginal, almost all young people locked up here are Indigenous. So, Aboriginal communities are by far the most affected by the new laws. The Country Liberal Party (CLP) government says it has a mandate after campaigning to keep Territorians safe. It helped the party claim a landslide victory in August's elections. Among those voting for the CLP was Sunil Kumar. The owner of two Indian restaurants in Darwin, he's had five or six break-ins this past year and wants politicians to take more action. ""It's young kids doing [it] most of the time - [they] think it's fun,"" explains Mr Kumar. He says he’s improved his locks, put in cameras and even offered soft drinks to kids loitering outside in a bid to win them over. ""How come they are out and parents don't know?” he says. “There should be a punishment for the parents."" But while the political rhetoric around crime is powerful, critics say it actually has little to do with real numbers. Youth offender rates have risen since Covid. Last year, there was a 4% rise nationally. But the rates are about half of what they were 15 years ago in the Northern Territory, Australian Bureau of Statistics figures show. Politicians, though, are playing to residents’ fears. As well as lowering the age of criminal responsibility, they have also introduced tougher bail legislation known as Declan's Law, after Declan Laverty, a 20-year-old who was fatally stabbed last year by someone on bail for a previous alleged assault. ""I never want another family to experience what we have,” said his mother Samara Laverty. ""The passing of this legislation is a turning point for the Territory, which will become a safer, happier, and more peaceful place."" On the day the laws started to be debated in Darwin last month, a small crowd of demonstrators stood outside parliament in a last-ditch effort to turn the political tide. One woman held up a placard that read: '10 year olds still have baby teeth'. Another asked: 'What if it was your child?' ""Our young people in Don Dale need to have opportunity for hope,"" said Aboriginal elder, Aunty Barb Nasir, addressing the demonstrators. She was referring to a notorious youth detention centre just outside Darwin, where evidence of abuse - including video of a child wearing a spit hood and shackled to a chair - outraged many in Australia and led to a royal commission inquiry. ""We need to always stand for them because they are lost in there,"" Aunty Barb said. Kat McNamara, an independent politician who opposed the bill, told the crowd: ""The idea that in order to support a 10-year-old you have to criminalise them is irrational, ineffective and morally bankrupt."" After a ripple of applause, she added: ""We are not going to stand for it."" But with a large majority in parliament, the CLP easily managed to pass the laws. Lowering the age of criminal responsibility undid legislation passed just last year that had briefly lifted the threshold to 12. And while other Australian states and territories have been under pressure to raise the age from 10 to 14, for now it is once again 10 across the country, with the exception of the Australian Capital Territory. Australia is not alone – in England and Wales, for instance, it is also set at 10. But in comparison, the majority of European Union members make it 14, in line with UN recommendations. The Northern Territory's Chief Minister, Lia Finocchiaro, argues that by lowering the age of criminal responsibility, authorities can ""intervene early and address the root causes of crime"". “We have this obligation to the child who has been let down in a number of ways, over a long period of time,” she said last month. ""And we have [an obligation to] the people who just want to be safe, people who don't want to live in fear any more."" But for people like Thomas, now 18, prison didn't fix anything. His crimes just got worse, and his time inside increased. He says he finds prison oddly comforting. It's not that he likes it, but with custody comes familiarity. ""Most of my family has been in and out of jail. I felt like I was at home because all the boys took care of me."" His two younger brothers are also stuck in a similar cycle. At one point, their mother was catching a bus to visit all three in prison every week. Thomas still wears an ankle bracelet issued by authorities but he has been out of prison for nearly three months now – his longest spell of freedom since becoming a teenager. He's been helped by Brother 2 Another - an Aboriginal-led project that mentors and supports First Nations children caught up in the justice system. ""Locking these kids up is just a reactive way to go about it,"" says Darren Damaso, a youth leader for Brother 2 Another. ""There needs to be more rehabilitative support services, more funding towards Aboriginal-led programmes, because they actually understand what's happening for these families. And then we're going to slowly start to see change. But if it's just a 'lock them up' default action, it's not going to work."" Mr Damaso is from the Larrakia Aboriginal people, the ancestral owners of the region of Darwin, and he also has connections to the Yanuwa and Malak Malak people. His organisation brings young people to a refashioned unit on an industrial estate on the outskirts of Darwin, providing a space to relax, a sensory room and a gym. Brother 2 Another also works in schools and tries to help young people find work - opportunities that many who've been involved with police and prisons struggle to engage with. ""It's a self-perpetuating cycle,” says John Lawrence, a Scottish criminal barrister who's been based in Darwin for more than three decades. He's represented many young people and argues more money needs to go into schooling than the prison system, to prevent incarceration in the first place. Aboriginal people “have no voice, and so they suffer great injustice and harm"", says Mr Lawrence. ""The fact that this can happen reveals very graphically and obviously how racist this country is.” The tough talk on crime isn't particular to politics in the Northern Territory. In Queensland's recent elections, the winning campaign by the Liberal National Party played heavily on its slogan: “Adult crime, adult time.” In a recent report by the Australian Human Rights Commission, Anne Hollonds, the National Children’s Commissioner, argued that by criminalising vulnerable children - many of them First Nations children - the country is creating ""one of Australia's most urgent human rights challenges"". “The systems that are meant to help them, including health, education and social services, are not fit-for-purpose and these children are falling through the gaps,” she said. “We cannot police our way out of this problem, and the evidence shows that locking up children does not make the community safer.” Which is why there's a growing push to fund early intervention through education, not incarceration, and trying to reduce marginalisation and disadvantage in the first place. ""What are the cultural strengths of people? What are the community strengths of people? We are building on that,” says Erin Reilly, a regional director for Children's Ground. Her organisation works with communities and schools on their ancestral lands, learning about foods and medicines from the bush and about the Aboriginal 'kinship’ system - how people fit in with their community and family. “We centre Indigenous world views and Indigenous values and we work in a way that works for Aboriginal people,” explains Ms Reilly. “We know that the education system and health systems don't work for our people."" For Thomas, life on the inside was hard, involving weeks at a time spent in isolation. But on the outside, he says, there’s little understanding of the circumstances he's lived through. ""I felt like no one cared. Nobody wanted to listen,"" he says. He points out the bite marks on his forearms and adds: ""So, I hurt myself all the time - see the scars here?""

Initially believed to be tar balls, they were in fact a ""disgusting"" combination of human faeces, cooking oil, chemicals and illicit drugs, researchers say. Eight beaches including Bondi were closed for several days and a massive clean-up ordered after thousands of the black deposits started appearing from 16 October. Testing by chemists has determined the balls were most likely the result of a sewage spill, though their exact origin remains unknown. Last month authorities in New South Wales (NSW) said they suspected the objects were a mixture of fatty acids, fuel oil and chemicals found in cleaning and cosmetic products. But further testing found the material is unlikely to have originated solely from an oil spill or waste from a ship, as some had thought. Each ball was slightly different but had a firm surface - hardened partially by accumulating sand and minerals like calcium - and a soft core. Inside was everything from cooking oil and soap scum molecules, to blood pressure medication, pesticides, hair, methamphetamine and veterinary drugs. ""They smell absolutely disgusting, they smell worse than anything you've ever smelt,"" lead investigator Associate Professor Jon Beves, from the University of NSW, told 9News. Professor William Alexander Donald said they resembled fat, oil, and grease blobs - often called fatbergs - which are commonly formed in sewerage systems. Detecting this along with recreational drugs and and industrial chemicals had ""pointed us to sewage and other sources of urban effluent"", he explained. The researchers said they had received unconfirmed reports of smaller but otherwise similar balls washing up over the past two years. Sydney Water has reported that there are no known issues with waste systems in the city."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gzd62g1r3o,Australia plans social media ban for under-16s,2024-11-07T00:59:31.257Z,Hannah Ritchie,"Australia's government says it will introduce ""world-leading"" legislation to ban children under 16 from social media. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said the proposed laws, to be tabled in parliament next week, were aimed at mitigating the ""harm"" social media was inflicting on Australian children. ""This one is for the mums and dads... They, like me, are worried sick about the safety of our kids online. I want Australian families to know that the government has your back,"" he said. While many of the details are yet to be debated, the government said the ban would apply to young people already on social media. There will be no exemptions on the age limit for children who have consent from their parents. The government says that the onus would be on social media platforms to show they are taking reasonable steps to prevent access. Albanese said there would be no penalties for users, and that it would be up to Australia's online regulator - the eSafety Commissioner - to enforce the laws. The legislation would come into force 12 months after it passes and be subject to a review after it's in place. While a lot of experts agree that social media platforms can harm the mental health of adolescents, many are sceptical over the efficacy of trying to outlaw them all together. Some researchers argue that bans only delay young people's exposure to apps such as TikTok, Instagram and Facebook, instead of teaching them how to navigate complex online spaces. Previous attempts at restricting access, including by the European Union, have largely failed or faced backlash from tech firms. And questions remain over how implementation would work given there are tools which can circumvent age-verification requirements. One of Australia's largest advocacy groups for child rights has criticised the proposed ban as ""too blunt an instrument"". In an open letter sent to the government in October, signed by over 100 academics and 20 civil society organisations, the Australian Child Rights Taskforce called on Albanese to instead look at imposing ""safety standards"" on social media platforms. The group also pointed to UN advice that ""national policies"" designed to regulate online spaces ""should be aimed at providing children with the opportunity to benefit from engaging with the digital environment and ensuring their safe access to it"". But other grassroots campaigners have lobbied Australia's government for the laws, saying bans are needed to protect children from harmful content, misinformation, bullying and other social pressures. A petition by the 36Months initiative, which has over 125,000 signatures, argues children are ""not yet ready to navigate online social networks safely"" until at least 16, and that currently ""excessive social media use is rewiring young brains within a critical window of psychological development, causing an epidemic of mental illness"". When asked whether there should be broader efforts to educate children about how to navigate the benefits and risks of being online, Albanese said that such an approach would be insufficient because it ""assumes an equal power relationship"". ""I don't know about you, but I get things popping up on my system that I don't want to see. Let alone a vulnerable 14-year-old,"" he told reporters on Thursday. ""These tech companies are incredibly powerful. These apps have algorithms that drive people towards certain behaviour."""

Gunn - who is known as B-girl Raygun - failed to get on the scoreboard in all three of her competition rounds in August, with a routine that included unorthodox moves, such as the sprinkler and a kangaroo hop. The 37-year-old university lecturer's moves catapulted her to global attention and ridicule, spawned conspiracy theories about her qualification, and reignited criticism of breaking's inclusion in the Olympics. Gunn had initially planned to keep competing but said the saga had been so ""upsetting"" that she changed her mind. ""I just didn’t have any control over how people saw me or who I was,"" she told local radio station 2DayFM on Wednesday. ""I was going to keep competing, for sure, but that seems really difficult for me to do now. “I think the level of scrutiny that’s going to be there, and people will be filming it, and it will go online."" Gunn received a torrent of violent messages after the Olympics, and was the subject of an anonymous petition demanding she apologise. It falsely accused her and her husband of manipulating her selection at the expense of other Australian talent. She was vigorously defended by Olympic officials, but her performance split opinion within the breaking community, with some saying she made a mockery of the sport. It also revived questions over whether breaking - which debuted in Paris but is not on the programme for the 2028 Games in Los Angeles - should have ever been included in the Olympics, due to the creative nature of the genre, which doesn't necessarily suit organised competition. Gunn has previously said the backlash took the joy out of the sport for her, which she again alluded to on Wednesday. ""Dancing is so much fun, and it makes you feel good. I don’t think people should feel crap about the way that they dance. ""I still dance, and I still break. But, you know, that’s like in my living room with my partner!"""

Cassius was nearly 5.5m (18ft) long, weighed nearly one tonne and was thought to be at least 110 years old - although no one knew for sure. The huge saltwater crocodile lived in the sanctuary on an island off the coast of Queensland since being caught in Australia's Northern Territory in the 1980s. In 2011, he was awarded the Guinness World Record for the largest crocodile in captivity. Marineland Melanesia Crocodile Habitat said in a post on social media that Cassius was ""our beloved mate"" and ""a cherished member of our family"". Cassius had previously lived in the wild, where he was known for catching and eating cattle, and attacking boat propellers before being captured. The habitat's founder, George Craig, bought Cassius in 1987, the Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported. Cassius ""brought joy and companionship to his best mate George for over 37 years"", the habitat said. The habitat added that Mr Craig relocated to Cairns last month and Cassius's health declined soon after. ""He was very old and believed to be living beyond the years of a wild croc,"" the post said. The habitat also thanked ""everyone who visited Cassius throughout his life and offered kindness"", adding that the site may be operating ""in a limited capacity over the next few days""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c748kmvwyv9o,"Monkeys will never type Shakespeare, study finds",2024-11-01T03:14:55.006Z,Hannah Ritchie,"Two Australian mathematicians have called into question an old adage, that if given an infinite amount of time, a monkey pressing keys on a typewriter would eventually write the complete works of William Shakespeare. Known as the ""infinite monkey theorem"", the thought-experiment has long been used to explain the principles of probability and randomness. However, a new peer-reviewed study led by Sydney-based researchers Stephen Woodcock and Jay Falletta has found that the time it would take for a typing monkey to replicate Shakespeare's plays, sonnets and poems would be longer than the lifespan of our universe. Which means that while mathematically true, the theorem is ""misleading"", they say. As well as looking at the abilities of a single monkey, the study also did a series of calculations based on the current global population of chimpanzees, which is roughly 200,000. The results indicated that even if every chimp in the world was enlisted and able to type at a pace of one key per second until the end of the universe, they wouldn't even come close to typing out the Bard's works. There would be a 5% chance that a single chimp would successfully type the word ""bananas"" in its own lifetime. And the probability of one chimp constructing a random sentence - such as ""I chimp, therefore I am"" - comes in at one in 10 million billion billion, the research indicates. “It is not plausible that, even with improved typing speeds or an increase in chimpanzee populations, monkey labour will ever be a viable tool for developing non-trivial written works,” the study says. The calculations used in the paper are based on the most widely accepted hypothesis for the end of the universe, which is the heat death theory. Despite its name, the so-called heat death would actually be slow and cold. In short, it's a scenario in which the universe continues to both expand and cool - while everything within it dies off, decays, and fades away. “This finding places the theorem among other probability puzzles and paradoxes... where using the idea of infinite resources gives results that don’t match up with what we get when we consider the constraints of our universe,” Associate Prof Woodcock said in a statement about the work."

Videos posted online by concert-goers at the Melbourne show on Wednesday show a man in the crowd shouting at Yorke. While not all of his words can be heard, he calls on the singer to ""condemn the Israeli genocide of Gaza"". Yorke responds by telling the heckler to ""hop up on stage"" to make his remarks. ""Don't stand there like a coward, come here and say it. You want to piss on everybody's night? Ok you do it, see you later,"" Yorke continues, before removing his guitar and halting his set. His exit came as the heckler had repeated his call and added ""how many dead children will it take"". Segments of the crowd could be heard booing the disturbance, and Yorke returned to cheers shortly after to play the Radiohead song Karma Police. Concert-goer Elly Brus said the protester ""did not have support"" from the Sidney Myer Music Bowl crowd. “He was escorted away by security. He then continued to engage with people outside the venue as well,"" she told the BBC. Israel launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the group's unprecedented attack on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, which killed about 1,200 people and saw 251 others taken hostage. More than 43,160 people have been killed in Gaza since then - including thousands of women and children - according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Both sides deny accusations they have broken the laws of war. In the past, Radiohead has faced pressure to cancel shows in Israel and take part in a cultural boycott of the country over its policies towards the Palestinians. Yorke pushed back on that pressure, saying that ""playing in a country isn't the same as endorsing its government"". ""We've played in Israel for over 20 years through a succession of governments, some more liberal than others,"" Yorke said in a statement in 2017, defending a decision to go ahead with a planned concert in Tel Aviv. ""We don't endorse [Israeli Prime Minister] Netanyahu any more than Trump, but we still play in America. Music, art and academia is about crossing borders not building them,"" he added at the time. Earlier this year, pro-Palestinian activists also accused Yorke's bandmate Jonny Greenwood of ""artwashing"" for performing alongside Israeli-Arabic musician Dudu Tassa in Tel Aviv. ""No art is as 'important' as stopping all the death and suffering around us,"" Greenwood said in a statement on X. ""But... silencing Israeli artists for being born Jewish in Israel doesn't seem like any way to reach an understanding between the two sides of this apparently endless conflict."" The BBC has contacted representatives for Yorke's Australian tour. The Arts Centre Melbourne, which oversees the Sidney Myer Music Bowl, declined to comment."

It was reported in July that 63,000 of the coins – produced by the Australian Mint – had been stolen from a warehouse in Western Sydney, about two months before they were due to enter circulation. Authorities recovered 40,061 coins on Tuesday after a raid on a property about 10km (6 miles) from the storage facility. Earlier that day, 27-year-old Christina Vale had been arrested and charged with breaking and entering and disposing of stolen property, police say. She was the third person arrested over the alleged theft. The coins, which are worth A$1 ($0.65; 50p) a piece, were stolen two months before their planned release. New South Wales Police said they had previously been selling online for 10 times their face value. Shortly after the theft was reported, Police in the state of New South Wales launched a special investigation into the incident codenamed Strike Force Bandit - after Bluey's father. In August, they arrested 44-year-old Steven Nielsen, who was an employee at the warehouse, and Nassar Kanj, also 44, who they say acted as his accomplice in the alleged heist. Police will now argue in court that Christina Vale was the pair's getaway driver. The gold-coloured coins are known as Bluey dollarbucks – which is how money is referred to in the cartoon – and feature images of characters from the show. The hit series, about the Heeler family of dogs, is made by Brisbane-based animation firm Ludo with BBC Studios and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation. Bluey has been a huge international success and is now broadcast in more than 60 countries including the UK, US and China. It was streamed for more than 20 billion minutes on Disney+ in the US last year, putting it in the country's top 10 streaming programmes for minutes viewed. There are more than 150 episodes of Bluey across three seasons, and a Bluey-themed “interactive experience” is opening in Brisbane next month. The stolen coins are different from a collectable set of Bluey currency that caused a frenzy when it went on sale by the Royal Australian Mint in June this year."

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1mlr7m7k27o,Australian PM accused of seeking upgrades from Qantas boss,2024-10-29T08:15:31.010Z,Joel Guinto,"Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has been accused of asking for free personal flight upgrades directly from the former CEO of national carrier Qantas. A new book by Australian journalist Joe Aston claims Albanese made several calls to ex-CEO Alan Joyce, and received upgrades on 22 flights taken between 2009 and 2019. In a press conference on Tuesday, Albanese did not say whether he had spoken to Joyce about personal upgrades, but said he followed the rules and had been ""completely transparent"" with his disclosures. ""There is no accusations being made with any specifics at all about any of this, none,"" he added. Albanese, who previously served as federal transport minister, also criticised former opposition party staffer Aston of ""trying to sell a book"". In his book - The Chairman's Lounge: The Inside Story of How Qantas Sold Us Out - Aston, reportedly cites Qantas insiders as saying Albanese spoke to Joyce about his personal travel plans. Albanese said he did recall having two conversations with Joyce about flights that did not involve personal travel. ""Of the 22 flights, 10 of them were... [in 2013] over a one-month period where both Qantas and Virgin provided upgrades for flights that were paid for by the Australian Labor party to make sure there was not any cost to taxpayers for what was internal business. ""In my time in public life, I have acted with integrity, I have acted in a way that is entirely appropriate and I have declared in accordance with the rules,"" he said. While it is not unheard of for Australian politicians to get free flight upgrades, they are required to declare such gifts. Australia's shadow transport minister Senator Bridget McKenzie has called for an inquiry to investigate the allegations. ""There are serious questions which only Mr Joyce and the Prime Minister can answer,"" she told reporters. Speaking on Today, a popular breakfast news show, she said she too had received a free flight updgrade in the past but added: ""There's a difference to receive a gift and declare it on your register to actually getting on the blower and saying, listen, mate, the missus and I are going overseas on a holiday. How about upgrading those economy tickets?"" Last year, the Albanese government faced questions for denying a request by Qatar Airways to increase flights to Australia - a move that aviation analysts said favoured Qantas. Criticism over that decision has now resurfaced as some opposition leaders questioned Albanese's personal relationship with Joyce. Joyce was chief executive of Qantas for 15 years and led the company through the 2008 global financial crisis, the Covid pandemic and record fuel prices. However, by the time he stepped down in 2023, Qantas was facing growing public anger over high fares, andured mass delays and cancellations. It also laid off 1,700 ground staff during the pandemic - a move that an Australian high court later ruled illegal."

New South Wales (NSW) Police said Lovisa Sjoberg was located on Sunday afternoon local time, suffering from a suspected snake bite, dehydration and a rolled ankle. The avid photographer was treated for her injuries at the scene, before being rushed to hospital, where she is in a stable condition. Sjoberg, 48, is a regular visitor to the remote Kosciuszko National Park, where she often documents wild horses living in the mountains. Fears grew for her safety after a hire car company reported that her car had not been returned and she could not be contacted. Her car was later found unlocked and abandoned. NSW Police launched an appeal on 21 October to the public to help find her and began a widescale search using sniffer dogs, firefighters, park rangers and a helicopter with infra-red capabilities. Concerns increased after rescue teams failed to find her after several days and temperatures in the area surrounding Kosciuszko National Park dropped as low as zero degrees at night. Sjoberg was found on Sunday afternoon local time by a National Parks and Wildlife Service officer on the Nungar Creek Trail at Kiandra. Supt Toby Lindsay told media that Sjoberg had been ""wandering [for] days"" through ""tough"" bushland, and told rescuers she believed she had been bitten by a copperhead snake four days earlier. The species tends to be shy rather than aggressive, but their venom is a powerful neurotoxin and can be fatal without medical intervention. “She’s in fact very fortunate to be alive... she obviously went through a tough time,"" Supt Lindsay said. He added that she was now in a ""reasonable condition"" and is "" happy to be alive""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cje3eqe8kvno,‘Not my King’ protest row highlights Australian divisions,2024-10-26T15:13:07.675Z,Hannah Ritchie,"When an Aboriginal Australian senator heckled King Charles moments after he delivered a speech in the nation’s Parliament House, it caught the world’s attention. Lidia Thorpe’s cries of “not my King” and “this is not your land” shone a light on a country that is still grappling with its colonial past. But in the debate that followed on the “appropriateness” of the protest, something else became clear: a split within the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community itself. In the wake of an unsuccessful referendum on their constitutional recognition - which left many feeling silenced - the question Australia’s first inhabitants are now grappling with is how to achieve the self-determination they have fought so long for. Indigenous Australians are classed as the oldest living culture on earth, and have inhabited the continent for at least 65,000 years. For more than 200 years though - since the 1770 arrival of Captain James Cook and subsequent British settlement - they have endured long chapters of colonial violence, including the theft of their lands, livelihoods, and even children. As a result, today, they still face acute disadvantages in terms of health, wealth, education, and life expectancy compared to non-Indigenous Australians. But, as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people make up less than 4% of the national population, their struggles rarely translate into national voting issues, experts say. Last year’s Voice to Parliament referendum - which asked whether Australia should recognise its first inhabitants in the constitution and allow them a body to advise the parliament - was a key exception. The result was a resounding ‘No’, with one major analysis of the data suggesting many voters found the proposal divisive and ineffective. And while the figures indicate a majority of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people voted 'Yes', support wasn’t unanimous. Thorpe herself was a leading ‘No’ campaigner, having criticised the measure as tokenistic and “an easy way to fake progress”. But Larissa Baldwin-Roberts, a Widjabul Wia-bal woman and activist, says the ‘No’ outcome left most Indigenous Australians with “a sense of humiliation and rejection”. She adds that the debate itself - which saw countless examples of misinformation and disinformation - unleashed a wave of “racist rhetoric” that their communities are still recovering from. The big-picture impact of the Voice, Ms Baldwin-Roberts argues, has been a growing sentiment that traditional reconciliation efforts are “dead”. Those approaches have long tried to bridge the gap between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians through polite dialogue and education. It was against this backdrop that Thorpe made her protest in parliament. “You can’t reconcile with a country that doesn’t see you,” Ms Baldwin-Roberts tells the BBC. “You can’t reconcile with a country that doesn’t think that you deserve justice.” Ms Baldwin-Roberts says “new strategies” are needed to disrupt the status quo. She sees Thorpe’s action as “incredibly brave” and reflective of conversations many First Nations people are having. “There are Indigenous communities around the country talking about our stolen children, our stolen histories - but she had access to that room. As an Australian senator she knows she’s going to get media, and it’s important to make this a talking point.” Daniel Williams, who is of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander descent, agrees. “After the [referendum] last year, what do Indigenous people have left? How can we find [an] audience with the monarch to effect change?” he asked a political panel on the ABC. “We're talking about 200 years of pain that is continuing to be unanswered and unresolved.” Others see it differently though: there is a long history of Indigenous leaders petitioning the Royal Family to recognise their peoples’ struggle, but the independent’s senator’s act - for some - went too far. Nova Peris, a former senator who was the first Aboriginal woman in parliament, described it as an “embarrassing” move which didn’t “reflect the manners, or approach to reconciliation, of Aboriginal Australians at large”. Both sides of parliament dismissed it as disrespectful and a failed attempt at grandstanding. Prof Tom Calma, a Kungarakan and Iwaidja man who was in the room, said it risked alienating “the other 96%” of Australia’s population who may not “see or understand the enduring impacts of colonisation”. “I don’t think the protest - the way that Senator Thorpe went about it - brings people along with us. And in the spirit of reconciliation, we need allies.” Mr Calma also felt that Thorpe’s demand that King Charles “give [Indigenous people] a treaty” was misplaced, given that those negotiations would be handled by Australia’s government, not the Crown. As it stands, Australia is one of the only Commonwealth countries to have never signed a treaty, or treaties, with its first inhabitants, or to have recognised them in its founding document. And with a general election expected before mid-next year, both sides of politics have sought to move on swiftly from the Voice debate, leaving much uncertainty over future policy. For Ms Baldwin-Roberts, this week’s juxtaposition between the crowds of royal supporters decked out in regalia, and those engaging in protest nearby, reflects “a large separation and social reality between Australia’s Indigenous and non-Indigenous populations” that exists today. And in order to bridge that gap, she believes “there has to be some level of reckoning”. “We live in different spaces, it’s still a largely separated nation. So where do we go from here?”"

Warner, 37, was banned from cricket for 12 months and prevented from holding leadership positions as part of his punishment for the ball-tampering scandal in 2018. It means Warner, who retired from international cricket this year, is free to captain in Australian domestic cricket, such as for Sydney Thunder in the Big Bash. Cricket Australia said the decision comes after a review by an independent panel. The panel said Warner had shown ""extreme remorse"", was ""sincere and genuine in acknowledging responsibility"" and could ""contribute towards the development of young cricketers"" if able to captain. Meanwhile, Australia skipper Pat Cummins appeared to rule out Warner reversing his Test retirement to fill the side's vacant opener position against India in the upcoming series. Warner has offered to come out of retirement for the series, with Australia needing an opener after Steve Smith's move back to the middle order. But, speaking to The Grade Cricketer podcast

Senior district official Sandeep Tiwari told BBC Hindi that 32 workers had been rescued and moved to an army camp nearby. The avalanche hit a Border Roads Organisation (BRO) camp in the village of Mana, which shares a border with Tibet, officials say. Officials said rescue operations were continuing in extreme weather amid heavy snowfall. Uttarakhand Chief Minister Pushkar Singh Dhami wrote on X that rescue work was being carried out by the Indo-Tibetan Border Police (ITBP), the BRO and other teams. Ambulances and emergency teams have been dispatched, but treacherous conditions continue to pose challenges for rescuers. Footage posted on X by ITBP showed rescuers carrying people on stretchers and walking through several feet of snow - even as more snow continued to fall. Colonel Ankur Mahajan, a commander with the BRO, told the Hindustan Times newspaper that those who had been rescued were receiving treatment ""but the extent of their injuries is unclear"". Gaurav Kunwar, a former village council member of Mana, told BBC News that details of the incident were sketchy. ""No-one lives there permanently. It's a migratory area and only labourers working on border roads stay there in the winter. There's also some army presence there. We've heard that it has been raining in the area for two days. The road workers were in a camp when the avalanche hit."" Earlier on Friday, the India Meteorological Department warned of heavy rainfall and snow in the northern Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand as well as Jammu and Kashmir. Orange alerts have also been issued for snowfall in several districts of Himachal Pradesh and Jammu and Kashmir."

Police have called for the woman - who is currently in Japan - to come forward for questioning on charges of sexual harrassment in a public space. The incident happened during the K-pop idol's first public event in Seoul last June, which saw him hug 1,000 fans. Instead of just hugging the star, the woman appeared to have kissed his face, with Jin responding by turning his face away. The kiss angered other BTS fans, one of whom filed a criminal complaint against her, leading police to launch an investigation. On 13 June, 2024, the day after he was discharged from the army, Jin, whose real name is Kim Seok-jin, held a fan event where he hugged 1,000 fans and performed songs in front of 3,000 others. During the three-hour long ""hugathon"", fans who won the chance to embrace him queued up and went on stage one by one to meet the 33-year-old star. But one of them caused an uproar when she appeared to kiss Jin's face. Clips of the moment went viral on the internet. Videos show that Jin, taken aback by the move, tried to turn his head while hugging the woman before quickly moving on to the next fan. Fans could also be seen reacting angrily to her actions. She later wrote on her blog later that she kissed him ""on his neck"" and ""the skin was very soft"". The woman's identity has not been revealed but police added that they had identified her with the assistance from their Japanese counterparts. The BBC has reached out to BTS' agency HYBE for comment. Jin is the first BTS member to have been discharged from military duty. He was followed by J-Hope who was discharged in October. The other five - V, RM, Jimin, Jungkook and Suga - are still serving and the band is expected to reunite only in June 2025. K-pop idols are known for having a close relationship with their fanbases through various communication channels and events. It's common for artists to communicate with fans through social media livestream chats and in-person events to cultivate loyal fans. But fans and agencies have increasingly been aware of some toxic fan cultures as well. For example, many artists have been vocal about the stress caused by ""sasaeng fans"", who are overly obsessed with their idols that would stalk and harass the artists."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c757zl67n7wo,"Five years since deadly Delhi riots, many police cases are falling apart",2025-02-27T23:22:26.243Z,Umang Poddar,"Five years after deadly religious riots engulfed India's capital Delhi, there is no legal closure in sight for the people involved. A BBC Hindi analysis has found that more than 80% of the cases related to the violence where courts gave decisions have resulted in acquittals or discharges. More than 50 people, mostly Muslims, were killed after clashes broke out between Hindus and Muslims over a controversial citizenship law in February 2020. The violence - the deadliest the city had seen in decades - stretched on for days, with hundreds of homes and shops set on fire by violent mobs. The BBC had earlier reported on incidents of police brutality and complicity during the riots. The police have denied any wrongdoing and in their investigation, alleged that the violence was ""pre-planned"" as a part of a larger conspiracy to ""threaten India's unity"" by the people who were protesting against the law. They registered 758 cases in connection with the investigation and arrested more than 2,000 people. This included 18 student leaders and activists who were arrested in a case that came to be known as the ""main conspiracy case"". They were charged under a draconian anti-terror law that makes it nearly impossible to get bail. Only six of them have been released in five years, and some like activist Umar Khalid are still in jail, waiting for a trial to begin. BBC Hindi examined the status of all the 758 cases filed in relation to the riots and analysed the 126 cases in which the Karkardooma court in Delhi had given decisions. More than 80% of these 126 cases resulted in acquittals or discharges as witnesses turned hostile, or did not support the prosecution's case. Only 20 of these cases saw convictions. Under Indian law, an accused is discharged when a court closes a case without a trial because there isn't sufficient evidence to go ahead. An acquittal is when the court finds the accused not guilty after a full trial. In 62 of the 758 cases that were filed on charges related to murder, there was only one conviction and four acquittals, data accessed by the BBC through India's Right to Information law shows. A detailed analysis of the 126 orders also showed that in dozens of cases, the court came down heavily on the Delhi police for lapses in investigations. In some cases, it criticised the police for filing ""predetermined chargesheets"" and ""falsely implicating"" the accused. In most of the 126 cases, police officials were presented as witnesses to the events. But for various reasons, the court did not find their testimonies credible. Judges have pointed out inconsistencies in the police statements, delays in identification of the accused by the police and, in some instances, cast doubts over whether policemen were even present when the violence broke out. In two orders, the judge said that he could not ""restrain"" himself from saying that when history looked back at the riots, the ""failure of the investigating agency to conduct a proper investigation"" would ""torment the sentinels of democracy"". The court was hearing cases filed against three men on charges of arson and looting - but concluded they had been arrested without any ""real or effective investigation"". The Delhi police did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. In a report filed last April, the police had told the court that all investigations were carried out in a ""credible, fair and impartial"" way. Testimonies from some of the accused and even the court's own observations, however, raise questions about the investigation. Shadab Alam, who spent 80 days in jail, says he can never forget the terror of the riots. He had taken shelter on the rooftop terrace of a medicine store where he worked with a few others. Just hours earlier, the police had arrived at the shop and asked them to shut it because of ongoing arson. ""Suddenly, they [the police] came again and took a few of us into their van,"" he told the BBC. When he asked the police why he was being taken, he said, they accused him of participating in rioting. ""They asked us our names and beat us up. Almost all of us arrested were Muslims,"" Mr Alam said. He added that he submitted his medical report before the court that confirmed three injuries. In its official report, the police charged Mr Alam and 10 other Muslims of burning down a shop. But the court discharged all of them even before the trial could begin. In its observations, the court criticised the police investigation saying that the witness's statements could have been ""artificially prepared"", and that ""in all probabilities"" the shop was burnt by a ""mob of persons from the Hindu community"". It said the police did not pursue the case in that direction, despite being present when the incident happened. Mr Alam had to wait four years for the case to be officially closed. ""All this happened during Covid-19 pandemic. There was a lockdown. We were in a state of frenzy,"" said Dilshad Ali, Alam's father. ""In the end, nothing was proved. But we had to spend so much time and money to prove our innocence."" He said the family wanted monetary compensation for their losses. ""If the police made a false case against my son, then action should be taken against them,"" he added. In another case, the court acquitted Sandip Bhati, who was accused of dragging and beating a Muslim man during the riots. The police had submitted two videos to show Mr Bhati was the culprit. But in court, his lawyer said that the police had submitted an incomplete clip to frame his client. In the full video, which the BBC has verified, Mr Bhati is seen saving the Muslim man instead of beating him up. In its order in January, the court ruled that the police ""manipulated"" the video to ""frame"" Mr Bhati instead of tracing the ""actual culprits"". It also asked the commissioner of Delhi police to take appropriate action against the investigating officer in the case. The police did not respond to BBC Hindi's question on whether this had been done. Mr Bhati, who spent four months in prison, refused to comment, saying he did not wish to discuss his ""ordeal"". With so many acquittals, former Supreme Court judge Madan Lokur said, the prosecution and police ""should sit down to introspect what they have achieved in five years"". He also said that ""accountability needs to be fixed on the prosecution as well if the arrest is found to be illegal or unnecessary"". ""If the prosecution puts someone in jail because they have the power to do so or because they want to do so, they should not be allowed to get away with it if the incarceration is found to be illegal or unnecessary,"" he added. Even as some cases fall apart in courts, many of those arrested are still languishing in jail awaiting a trial. Gulfisha Fatima, a 33-year-old PhD aspirant, is among 12 activists who are still in jail on charges of being ""conspirators"" of the riots. Her family said three other police cases were lodged against her and she got bail in all of them. But she continues to face incarceration in a fourth case under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act (UAPA) - the stringent anti-terror law that sets exceptionally challenging conditions for bail. ""Since she's gone to jail, with every hearing we hope she will finally come out,"" her father Syed Tasneef Hussain told the BBC. In Ms Fatima's case, after months of hearing the bail plea, the judge from the Delhi High Court got transferred in 2023, and now the entire case is being heard again. ""Sometimes I wonder if I'll be able to see her or if I'll die before that,"" Mr Hussain said. Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c14jjxz8re6o,Thailand deports dozens of Uyghurs to China,2025-02-27T20:14:46.940Z,Laura Bicker and Kathryn Armstrong,"At least 40 Uyghurs have been deported to China,Thai authorities have confirmed, despite warnings from rights groups they could face possible torture and even death. The group is thought to have been flown back to China's Xinjiang region on Thursday, after being held for 10 years in a Bangkok detention centre. China has been accused of committing crimes against humanity and possibly genocide against the Uyghur population and other mostly Muslim ethnic groups in the north-western region of Xinjiang. Beijing denies all of the allegations. It is the first time Thailand has deported Uyghurs since 2015. The deportation has been shrouded in secrecy after serious concerns were raised by the United States and United Nations. Thai media reported that several trucks, some with windows blocked with sheets of black plastic, left Bangkok's main immigration detention centre in the early hours of Thursday morning. Hours later, tracker Flightrader24 showed an unscheduled China Southern Airlines flight leaving Bangkok, eventually arriving in Xinjiang. It was not immediately clear how many people had been deported. The Thai government later said it had decided to send the 40 Uyghurs back to China because it was not right that they had been held for more than a decade, but that no other third country had stepped forward offering to take them. That includes Turkey, which has given Uyghurs asylum in the past. Eight Uyghurs remain in Thailand, including five who are serving jail terms for crimes they committed while in detention. The government also said that Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra was given assurances that the Uyghurs would be looked after if returned to China during her recent visit to the country. She did not initially confirm any deportations had taken place when asked by reporters on Thursday. ""In any country in the world actions must adhere to the principles of law, international processes, and human rights,"" Shinawatra said. Beijing said that 40 Chinese illegal immigrants were repatriated from Thailand, but refused to confirm that the group were Uyghurs. ""The repatriation was carried out in accordance with the laws of China and Thailand, international law and international practice,"" the foreign ministry said. Chinese state media said the group had been ""bewitched"" by criminal organisations and were stranded in Thailand after illegally leaving the country. The returned group is made up of more than 300 Uyghurs who were detained at the Thai border in 2014 after fleeing repression in Xinjiang. Many were sent to Turkey, while others were deported back to China in 2015 - prompting a storm of protest from governments and human rights groups. ""What is the Thai government doing?"" asked opposition lawmaker Kannavee Suebsang on social media on Thursday. ""There must not be Uyghur deportation to face persecution. They were jailed for 11 years. We violated their human rights for too long."" The detention centre where the Uyghurs - who had been charged with no crime, apart from entering Thailand without a visa - were kept was known to be unsanitary and overcrowded. Five Uyghurs died in custody. In a statement on Thursday, Human Rights Watch said the group now face a high risk of torture, enforced disappearance and long-term imprisonment. ""Thailand's transfer of Uyghur detainees to China constitutes a blatant violation of Thailand's obligations under domestic and international laws,"" said the organisation's Asia director, Elaine Pearson. ""Until yesterday [Wednesday], senior Thai officials had made multiple public assurances that these men would not be transferred, including to allies and UN officials."" Phil Robertson, director of the Asia Human Rights and Labour Advocates (AHRLA) group, said that the deportations ""totally destroyed"" the ""charade"" that the current Thai government was different to the previous one ""when it comes to transnational repression and cooperating with authoritarian neighbours"". Amnesty International described the deportations as ""unimaginably cruel"". On Thursday, US Secretary of State Marco Rubio condemned Thailand for the deportation and urged ""all governments in countries where Uyghurs seek protection not to forcibly return ethnic Uyghurs to China."" He accused China of having ""committed genocide and crimes against humanity targeting predominantly Muslim Uyghurs and other members of ethnic and religious minority groups in Xinjiang"" in a statement published online. The UN said it ""deeply regrets"" the deportations, a phrase echoed by the EU. Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK disagrees ""in the strongest terms"" with Thailand's decision. There are about 12 million Uyghurs, mostly Muslim, living in Xinjiang, which is officially known as the Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region (XUAR). The Uyghurs speak their own language, which is similar to Turkish, and see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. They make up less than half of the Xinjiang population. Recent decades have seen a mass migration of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) into Xinjiang, allegedly orchestrated by the state to dilute the minority population there. China has also been accused of targeting Muslim religious figures and banning religious practices in the region, as well as destroying mosques and tombs.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjev9kzxeqqo,Inside the Taliban's surveillance network monitoring millions,2025-02-27T00:59:13.405Z,Mahjooba Nowrouzi,"In a crowded control centre, surrounded by dozens of TV screens, the Taliban's police force proudly shows off its newly-acquired network of 90,000 CCTV cameras - used to watch over the day-to-day lives of millions of people. ""We monitor the entire city of Kabul from here,"" says Khalid Zadran, a spokesperson for the Taliban police chief, pointing to one of the screens. The authorities say such surveillance will help fight crime, but critics fear it will be used to clamp down on dissent and to monitor the strict morality code enforced by the Islamist Taliban government under their interpretation of Sharia law. The BBC are the first international journalists allowed to see the system in action. Inside the control room, police officers sit in rows watching the live streams from thousands of cameras, keeping tabs on the lives of the six million people who live in Kabul. From car licence plates to facial expressions, everything is monitored. ""In certain neighbourhoods, when we notice groups of people and suspect they might be involved in drug use, criminal activities, or something suspicious, we quickly reach out to the local police,"" says Zadran. ""They arrive swiftly to investigate the nature of the gathering."" Under the previous government, Kabul was threatened daily with attacks from the Taliban and so-called Islamic State militants, as well as high profile kidnappings and car-jackings. When the Taliban retook power in 2021, they promised to crack down on crime. The dramatic increase in the number of surveillance cameras in the capital is a sign of growing sophistication in the way the Taliban enforce law and order. Before their return, just 850 cameras were in place in the capital, according to a spokesman for the security forces that were driven from power. However, in the past three years, the Taliban authorities have also introduced a range of draconian measures limiting people's rights and freedoms, especially those of women. The Taliban government has not been formally recognised by any other country.  The surveillance system the BBC is shown in Kabul features the option to track people by facial recognition. On the corner of one screen images pop up with each face categorised by age range, gender, and whether or not they have a beard or a face mask. ""On clear days, we can zoom in on individuals [who are] kilometres away,"" says Zadran, highlighting a camera positioned up high that focuses on a busy traffic junction. The Taliban even monitor their own personnel. At a checkpoint, as soldiers popped open the trunk of a car for inspection, the operators focused their lenses, zooming in to scrutinise the contents within. The interior ministry says the cameras have ""significantly contributed to enhancing safety, curbing crime rates, and swiftly apprehending offenders"". It adds the introduction of CCTV and motorcycle controls have led to a 30% decrease in crime rates between 2023 and 2024 but it is not possible to independently verify these figures. However, rights groups are concerned about who is being monitored and for how long. Amnesty International say installing cameras ""under the guise of 'national security' sets a template for the Taliban to continue their draconian policies that violate fundamental rights of people in Afghanistan - especially women in public spaces"". By law women are not allowed to be heard outside their houses, although in practice this is not being strictly enforced. Teenage girls are prevented from accessing secondary and higher education. Women are barred from many forms of employment. In December, women training as midwives and nurses told the BBC they had been ordered not to return to classes. While women continue to be visible on the streets of cities like Kabul, they are required to wear a face covering. Fariba*, a young graduate who lives with her parents in Kabul, has been unable to find work since the Taliban came to power. She tells the BBC there is ""significant concern that surveillance cameras may be used to monitor women's hijabs [veils]"". The Taliban say only the city police have access to the CCTV system and the Propagation of Virtue and Prevention of Vice Ministry – the Taliban's morality police - does not use it. But Fariba is concerned the cameras will further endanger those opposed to Taliban rule. ""Many individuals, especially ex-military members, human rights advocates and protesting women, struggle to move freely and often live in secrecy,"" she says. ""There is significant concern that surveillance cameras will be used to monitor women's hijabs too,"" she says. Human Rights Watch, meanwhile, says Afghanistan does not have the data protection laws in place to regulate how the collected CCTV footage is held and used. The police say the data is kept only for three months, while, according to the interior ministry, the cameras do not pose a threat to privacy as they ""are operated from a special and completely confidential room by a specific and professional person in charge"". The cameras appear to be Chinese-made. The control room monitors and branding on the feeds the BBC saw carried the name Dahua, a Chinese government-linked company. Earlier reports that the Taliban were in talks with China's Huawei Technologies to buy cameras were denied by the company. Taliban officials refused to answer BBC questions about where they sourced the equipment. Some of the cost of installing the new network is falling on ordinary Afghans who are being monitored by the system. In a house in central Kabul the BBC spoke to Shella*, who was asked to pay for some of the cameras installed on the streets near her home. ""They demanded thousands of afghanis from every household,"" she says. It's a large amount in a country where those women who have jobs may earn only around 5,000 afghanis ($68; £54) a month.  The humanitarian situation in Kabul, and in Afghanistan in general, remains precarious after years of war. The country's economy is in crisis, but international aid funding has been largely stopped since the Taliban came back to power. According to the United Nations, 30 million people are in need of aid. ""If families refused to pay [for the cameras], they were threatened with water and power cuts within three days,"" Shella adds. ""We had to take loans to cover the costs. ""People are starving - what good are these cameras to them?"" The Taliban say that if people do not want to contribute, they can put in an official complaint. ""Participation was voluntary, and donations were in the hundreds, not thousands,"" Khalid Zadran, the Taliban police spokesperson, insists. Despite the assurances, rights campaigners both inside and outside Afghanistan continue to have concerns over how such a powerful surveillance system will be used. Jaber, a vegetable seller in Kabul, says the cameras represent another way in which Afghans are made to feel powerless. ""We are treated like trash, denied the opportunity to earn a living, and the authorities regard us as worthless,"" he told the BBC. ""We can do nothing."" *The names of the women interviewed for this piece were changed for their safety With additional reporting by Peter Ball "

The Ethiopian, who calls himself Mike, said he is being held with 450 others in a building inside Myanmar, along the country's border with Thailand. They are among the thousands of people who have been freed from the notorious scam compounds that have thrived on the border for years, in what appears to be the toughest action so far against the industry along the Thai-Myanmar border. But many of them are now stranded in Myanmar in makeshift camps because the process of assessing them and arranging flights back to their own countries is so slow. The armed militia groups who are holding them have a very limited capacity to support so many people – more than 7,000. One of them has said they have stopped freeing people from the compounds because they are not being moved to Thailand fast enough. The BBC understands that conditions in the camps are unsanitary, food barely sufficient, and many of the freed workers, like Mike, are in poor health. He is suffering from panic attacks, after working for a year in a scam centre where he was routinely beaten. He told us they got two very basic meals a day, there were only two toilets for 450 people, who he said were now relieving themselves wherever they could. Mike described being invited a year ago to take up what he was promised would be a good job, in Thailand, requiring only good English language and typing skills. Instead he found himself subjected to a brutal regime, forced to work long hours every day to meet the target for defrauding people online set by his Chinese bosses. ""It was the worst experience of my life. Of course I was beaten. But believe me I have seen a lot worse done to other people."" Mike is one of an estimated 100,000 people who are believed to have been lured to work in the scam operations along the Thai-Myanmar border, most of them run by Chinese fraud and gambling operatives who have taken advantage of the lawlessness in this part of Myanmar. Despite horrifying accounts of abuse from those who escaped in the past, thousands still come from parts of the world where good jobs are scarce, enticed by promises of good money. China, where many of the scam victims come from, has acted to shut down scam operations along its own border with Myanmar, but until this year neither China nor Thailand had done much about the Thai-Myanmar border. Ariyan, a young man from Bangladesh, has come back to Thailand to try to help 17 friends who are still there. He said he made a promise to himself to do this after his own gruelling escape from one of the most notorious scam centres last October. He showed us a brief, shaky video of the compound, still under construction in a remote, forested valley, where he was held, and remembers the terrible treatment he and his friends suffered at the hands of their Chinese boss. ""They gave us a target every week, $5,000. If not, they gave us two electric shocks. Or they put us in a dark room, with no windows. But if we earned a lot of money, they were very happy with us."" Ariyan had to approach men in the Middle East and lure them into transferring funds to fictitious investments. Using AI, the scammers made him appear on the screen to be an attractive young woman, altering his voice as well. He says he hated doing it. He remembers one man who was willing to sell his wife's jewellery to fund the fraudulent investment, and wishing he could warn him. But he said the bosses monitored all their calls. The release of the scam workers started more than two weeks ago after Thailand, under pressure from China and some of its own politicians, cut power and telecommunications links to the compounds on the border. It limited banking access to the scam bosses and issued arrest warrants for some of the militia leaders who had been protecting the business. That hit the business, but it also hit the ordinary Karen people who live nearby even harder, putting pressure on the militia commanders to show willingness in ending the abuses in the scam centres. They began helping those trying to escape, and completely evacuating some compounds. The camp Mike is housed in is now being guarded by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, a breakaway insurgent faction of the ethnic Karen community. Until recently, it was protecting the many scam compounds which have sprung up in its territory. You can see them easily as you drive along the Moei River which divides the two countries - unlikely expanses of new buildings over in war-torn Karen State contrasting with the rural landscape on the Thai side of the border. Thailand insists it is moving as fast as it can to process the former scam workers and get them home. A group of 260 freed workers were brought over the Moei River on a raft earlier this month. And around 621 Chinese nationals were flown straight back to China with a police escort on chartered planes. Otherwise, the movement of freed workers to Thailand seems to have stalled. The problem is that they are from many different countries, some of which are doing little to help get their people home. Around 130 of the first 260 who came over are from Ethiopia, which does not have an embassy in Bangkok. The BBC has been told that some other African countries will only fly their people home if someone else pays. Most of the freed workers have nothing; even their passports were withheld by the compound bosses. Thailand fears bringing over thousands of people it will then have to look after indefinitely. It also wants to screen them to find out which are genuine victims of human trafficking and which may have committed criminal acts, but does not have the capacity to do this with such a large group of people. Different ministries and agencies, including the army, are involved in managing this problem, and have to agree who does what. It does not help that several senior police and immigration officers have been transferred over their alleged involvement in the scam business. ""If this issue is not resolved, then we will not stop working on it – we must work seriously,"" said Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra on Tuesday in Bangkok. But she was referring to the wider problem of the scam business, not the growing humanitarian crisis among the freed workers. ""Unfortunately, it seems we're in a bit of a standstill,"" says Judah Tana, an Australian who runs an NGO which has for years been helping the victims of trafficking in the scam centres. ""We are hearing distressing information about the lack of sanitation and toilets. Many of the 260 who already came were screened for TB and tested positive. We are hearing from those who are still inside that people are coughing up blood. They are very happy that they have been liberated from the scam compounds, but our worry is that we're not engaging fast enough."" Thailand now seems ready to bring over one group of 94 Indonesians, as their embassy has been pushing for their release for several days and has booked flights to Indonesia for them. But that still leaves more than 7,000 still inside Myanmar, unsure what will now happen to them. Mike told me he and many others with him feared that if they are not allowed to cross into Thailand soon, the DKBA may hand them back to the scam bosses, where they could face punishment for trying to leave. On Wednesday night his panic attacks and breathing were so bad, he said, they took him to hospital. ""I just want to go home,"" he said over the phone. ""I just want to go back to my country. That is all I am asking."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62e36jm4jro,Did Iron Age 'begin' in India? Tamil Nadu dig sparks debate,2025-02-26T22:32:33.838Z,Soutik Biswas,"For over 20 years, archaeologists in India's southern state of Tamil Nadu have been unearthing clues to the region's ancient past. Their digs have uncovered early scripts that rewrite literacy timelines, mapped maritime trade routes connecting India to the world and revealed advanced urban settlements - reinforcing the state's role as a cradle of early civilisation and global commerce. Now they've also uncovered something even older - evidence of what could be the earliest making and use of iron. Present-day Turkey is one of the earliest known regions where iron was mined, extracted and forged on a significant scale around the 13th Century BC. Archaeologists have discovered iron objects at six sites in Tamil Nadu, dating back to 2,953–3,345 BCE, or between 5,000 to 5,400 years old. This suggests that the process of extracting, smelting, forging and shaping iron to create tools, weapons and other objects may have developed independently in the Indian subcontinent. ""The discovery is of such a great importance that it will take some more time before its implications sink in,"" says Dilip Kumar Chakrabarti, a professor of South Asian archaeology at Cambridge University. The latest findings from Adichchanallur, Sivagalai, Mayiladumparai, Kilnamandi, Mangadu and Thelunganur sites have made local headlines such as ""Did the Iron Age Begin in Tamil Nadu?"" The age marks a period when societies began using and producing iron widely, making tools, weapons and infrastructure. Parth R Chauhan, a professor of archaeology at the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research (ISSER), urges caution before drawing broad conclusions. He believes that iron technology likely emerged ""independently in multiple regions"". Also, the ""earliest evidence remains uncertain because many regions of the world have not been properly researched or archaeological evidence is known but has not been dated properly"". If the Tamil Nadu discovery is further validated through rigorous academic study, ""it would certainly rank amongst the world's earliest records"", Mr Chauhan says. Oishi Roy, an archaeologist at ISSER, adds that the find ""suggests parallel developments [in iron production] across different parts of the world"". Early iron came in two forms - meteoritic and smelted. Smelted iron, extracted from ore, marked the true beginning of iron technology with mass production. The earliest known iron artefacts - nine tubular beads - were made from meteoritic iron, which comes from fallen meteorites. Identifying iron-bearing rocks is the first challenge. Once located, these ores must be smelted in a furnace at extremely high temperatures to extract the metal. Without this process, raw iron remains locked within the rock. After extraction, skilled ironsmiths shape the metal into tools and implements, marking a crucial step in early ironworking. Most sites in Tamil Nadu where iron has been found are ancient habitation areas near present-day villages. Archaeologists K Rajan and R Sivanantham say that excavators have so far explored a fraction of over 3,000 identified Iron Age graves containing sarcophagi (stone coffins) and a wealth of iron artefacts. In the process, they uncovered hoe-spades, spears, knives, arrowheads, chisels, axes and swords made of iron. At burials excavated at one site, over 85 iron objects - knives, arrowhead, rings, chisels, axes and swords - were found inside and outside burial urns. More than 20 key samples were robustly dated in five labs worldwide, confirming their antiquity. Some finds are particularly striking. Historian Osmund Bopearachchi of the Paris-based French National Centre for Scientific Research highlights a key discovery - an iron sword from a burial site, made of ultra-high-carbon steel and dating to 13th–15th Century BC. This advanced steel, a direct evolution of Iron Age metallurgy, required sophisticated knowledge and precise high-temperature processes. ""We know that the first signs of real steel production date back to the 13th Century BC in present-day Turkey. The radiometric dates seem to prove that the Tamil Nadu samples are earlier,"" he said. Ms Roy adds that the early steel in Tamil Nadu indicates the people there ""were iron makers, not just users - a technologically advanced community evolving over time"". Also, in a site called Kodumanal, excavators found a furnace, pointing to an advanced iron-making community. The furnace area stood out with its white discolouration, likely from extreme heat. Nearby, excavators found iron slag - some of it fused to the furnace wall - hinting at advanced metalworking techniques. Clearly the people at the site were not just using iron, but actively producing and processing it. To be sure, the Tamil Nadu excavations are not the first in India to uncover iron. At least 27 sites across eight states have revealed evidence of early iron use, some dating back 4,200 years. The latest Tamil Nadu digs pushes back the antiquity of Indian iron by another 400 years,"" archaeologist Rajan, who has co-authored a paper on the subject, told me. ""The Iron Age is a technological shift, not a single-origin event - it develops in multiple places independently,"" says Ms Roy, noting earlier discoveries in eastern, western and northern India. ""What's clear now,"" she adds, ""is that indigenous iron technology developed early in the Indian subcontinent."" Experts say the excavations in Tamil Nadu are significant and could reshape our understanding of the Iron Age and iron smelting in the Indian subcontinent. Also, ""what these digs testify is to the existence of a distinctly sophisticated style of civilisation,"" notes Nirmala Lakshman, author of The Tamils - A Portrait of a Community. However, archaeologists caution that there is still a lack of excavations needed to collect fresh data from all over India. As one expert put it, ""Indian archaeology is in silent mode outside Tamil Nadu."" Katragadda Paddayya, a leading Indian archaeologist, said this was ""just the starting point"". ""We need to delve deeper into the origins of iron technology - these findings mark the beginning, not the conclusion. The key is to use this as a premise, trace the process backward and identify the sites where iron production truly began."""

Bhartia is the founder and chairman of Jubilant Bhartia Group. Its subsidiary Jubilant Foodworks is the largest franchisee for Domino's Pizza outside of the US. The woman, who can't be named under Indian law, accuses Bhartia of intoxicating and then ""brutally"" raping her in Singapore. Bhartia has denied the allegations as ""baseless, false and disparaging"" in a filing with the Bombay Stock Exchange on Tuesday. The company said Bhartia would fully cooperate with the investigation. Jubiliant FoodWorks has not responded separately to the BBC's request for comment. The woman said she first complained to the police on 11 November 2024. But her case was registered only on 22 February on orders of the Bombay High Court after it heard her petition. The petition and the police complaint seen by the BBC alleged that the woman first met Bhartia in 2022 at a five star hotel in Mumbai through a co-accused, who allegedly promised to introduce her to people who could help further her career in the entertainment industry. She alleges that Bhartia agreed to invest in her film project and asked her to come to Singapore, giving her his credit card details to book flight tickets. In the petition, the woman also alleged that the co-accused made a video of the rape in Singapore in 2023. She further alleged that she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Bhartia thereafter that year. In the company's filing with the stock exchange, Jubiliant FoodWorks said the court had made it clear it had not gone into the ""merits of the complaint"". It rubbished the allegations against Bhartia saying they were made with a ""clear mala fide intent against him""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdx2nedlzgko,Indian doctors remove teen's 'parasitic' twin in rare surgery,2025-02-26T08:51:28.978Z,Cherylann Mollan,"Doctors in the Indian capital, Delhi, have performed a life-changing surgery on a 17-year-old boy to remove his ""parasitic"" twin that was attached to his abdomen. A parasitic twin is an underdeveloped conjoined twin that relies entirely on the host twin for survival. They are extremely rare, with less than one case occurring per 100,000 births. The teenager who had a fully developed extra set of limbs and a pelvis - sustained by a chest artery - underwent a two-hour surgery at Aiims hospital in Delhi. Dr Asuri Krishna, who led the team of specialists, said the surgery was particularly challenging because of the patient's age. ""Only 40-50 cases of parasitic twins have been documented in world medical literature and, in those cases, the surgery had been attempted on children,"" Dr Krishna told the BBC. With insufficient medical literature to guide them, the team had to rely on their ""intuition, skill and knowledge"", he added. Parasitic twins form when one foetus partially develops while attached to the other. In this case, the teenager had two fully formed legs, buttocks and external genitalia - weighing nearly 15kg - protruding from his abdomen. Remarkably, the parasitic limbs could feel pain, touch and change in temperature. Dr Krishna said the first thing they did was identify how interconnected the parasitic and host twins were. Through scans, the doctors found out that the parasitic twin was attached to the teen's breastbone and was being supplied blood from a vessel in his chest. ""But there wasn't much connection with other main organs like the liver or kidneys,"" Dr Krishna said, adding that they also found a large cyst in the teen's abdomen. The surgery was done in two stages - first, removing the parasitic twin, then extracting the cystic mass from surrounding organs. A team of doctors, including radiologists, anaesthetists and plastic surgeons, completed the procedure in two-and-a-half hours. ""A mesh of shared blood vessels, nerves and tissues had to be separated. Care had to be taken to see that none of the host's organs or tissues were damaged,"" Dr Krishna said. During surgery, the teen's blood pressure dropped dangerously as 30-40% of his blood flowed to the parasitic twin. But the doctors said they were prepared for it and swiftly stabilised him. The teen was discharged four days after being admitted. He is healthy and has suffered no complications from the surgery, Dr Krishna says. The teenager's unusual appearance made him the subject of gossip and ridicule in his neighbourhood in Unnao, Uttar Pradesh. The stares and jokes took a toll on his mental health, leaving him feeling isolated and lonely. ""I couldn't travel anywhere or do any physical activity,"" he told the Indian Express newspaper, adding that he had dropped out of school in the eighth grade. The 17-year-old told the Express that he was ecstatic and now wanted to live an active life. ""I hope to study and get a job. A new world has opened up to me,"" he said."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjry8zz8yego,Chinese foodies pose as mourners to try funeral home's noodles,2025-02-26T06:21:07.684Z,Koh Ewe,"Foodies in China have been reportedly flocking to an unlikely destination - a funeral home - after a noodle dish served at its canteen went viral on social media. The dish is found at the Erlong Funeral Home in the southwestern province of Guizhou. The canteen caters to the funeral home's customers, but as word began to spread about its noodles, hordes of diners - some posing as mourners - began showing up to try the food. Erlong has since announced it will allow some members of the public to eat at its premises, as long as they do not disturb genuine mourners. The funeral home offers various types of noodle dishes during breakfast and supper hours, which cost 10 yuan per bowl ($1.38; £1.09). The most popular type is reportedly the noodles topped with minced pork and peanuts. One Erlong worker told Jiupai News that they ""only served customers who come to the funeral home to handle matters"". But other people have been sneaking in to get a bowl of noodles, the worker said, adding that sometimes queues at Erlong are so long that diners sometimes have to wait a couple of hours to get their food. ""There have been people pretending to be relatives of the deceased, it's hard to tell them apart when it gets crowded, and it's hard to manage,"" he said. To meet the demand, the funeral home has since decided to offer 50 bowls of noodles to members of the public every day - for free - as long as ""they do not affect people's mourning"", according to Erlong's chef in an interview with local media. While the noodle dish was already popular among locals, the craze appeared to have ramped up earlier this month when a social media user posted about the dish while visiting a friend in Guizhou, which is known for its spicy and sour dishes. ""My friend says the food at this funeral home is so good,"" they wrote earlier this month on Xiaohongshu, also known as RedNote. ""The queue for food is longer than the queue to lay flowers for the deceased."" ""I didn't get to eat the noodles, because my friend's mum didn't know anyone who was holding a funeral service."" Since then, many Chinese social media users have also shared their experiences eating the noodles. On Douyin, the Chinese version of TikTok, one user shared a photo of the dining hall's tickets, with what appeared to be a crowd queuing up for food. ""I heard the noodles here were very good,"" they wrote. ""I thought about how short life was, and got another bowl."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8rk5d7ekjmo,Billion Indians have no spending money - report,2025-02-25T22:21:51.477Z,"Nikhil Inamdar, BBC News, Mumbai","India is home to 1.4 billion people but around a billion lack money to spend on any discretionary goods or services, a new report estimates. The country's consuming class, effectively the potential market for start-ups or business owners, is only about as big as Mexico, 130-140 million people, according to the report from Blume Ventures, a venture capital firm. Another 300 million are ""emerging"" or ""aspirant"" consumers but they are reluctant spenders who have only just begun to open their purse strings, as click-of-a-button digital payments make it easy to transact. What is more, the consuming class in Asia's third largest economy is not ""widening"" as much as it is ""deepening"", according to the report. That basically means India's wealthy population is not really growing in numbers, even though those who are already rich are getting even wealthier. All of this is shaping the country's consumer market in distinct ways, particularly accelerating the trend of ""premiumisation"" where brands drive growth by doubling down on expensive, upgraded products catering to the wealthy, rather than focusing on mass-market offerings. This is evident in zooming sales of ultra-luxury gated housing and premium phones, even as their lower-end variants struggle. Affordable homes now constitute just 18% of India's overall market compared with 40% five years ago. Branded goods are also capturing a bigger share of the market. And the ""experience economy"" is booming, with expensive tickets for concerts by international artists like Coldplay and Ed Sheeran selling like hot cakes. Companies that have adapted to these shifts have thrived, Sajith Pai, one of the report's authors, told the BBC. ""Those who are too focused at the mass end or have a product mix that doesn't have exposure to the premium end have lost market share."" The report's findings bolster the long-held view that India's post-pandemic recovery has been K-shaped - where the rich have got richer, while the poor have lost purchasing power. In fact, this has been a long-term structural trend that began even before the pandemic. India has been getting increasingly more unequal, with the top 10% of Indians now holding 57.7% of national income compared with 34% in 1990. The bottom half have seen their share of national income fall from 22.2% to 15%. The latest consumption slump, however, has deepened amid not just a destruction in purchasing power, but also a precipitous drop in financial savings and surging indebtedness among the masses. The country's central bank has also cracked down on easy unsecured lending that propped up demand after the Covid pandemic. Much of the consumption spending of the ""emerging"" or ""aspirant"" class of Indians was led by such borrowing and ""turning off that tap will definitely have some impact on consumption"", says Pai. In the short run, two things are expected to help boost spending - a pick-up in rural demand on the back of a record harvest and a $12 billion tax give-away in the recently concluded budget. It will not be ""dramatic"" but could boost India's GDP - largely driven by consumption - by over half a percent, says Pai. But major longer-term headwinds remain. India's middle class - which has been a major engine for consumer demand - is being squeezed out, with wages pretty much staying flat, according to data compiled by Marcellus Investment Managers. ""The middle 50% of India's tax-paying population has seen its income stagnate in absolute terms over the past decade. This implies a halving of income in real terms [adjusted for inflation],"" says the report, published in January. ""This financial hammering has decimated the middle class's savings - the RBI [Reserve Bank of India] has repeatedly highlighted that net financial savings of Indian households are approaching a 50-year low. This pounding suggests that products and services associated with middle-class household spending are likely to face a rough time in the years ahead,"" it adds. The Marcellus report also points out that white-collar urban jobs are becoming harder to come by as artificial intelligence automates clerical, secretarial and other routine work. ""The number of supervisors employed in manufacturing units [as a percentage of all employed] in India has gone down significantly,"" it adds. The government's recent economic survey has flagged these concerns as well. It says labour displacement as a result of these technological advancements is of particular concern for a mainly services-driven economy like India, where a significant share of the IT workforce is employed in low value-added services sectors that are most prone to disruption. ""India is also a consumption-based economy, thus the fall in consumption that can result from the displacement of its workforce is bound to have macroeconomic implications. If the worst-case projections materialise, this could have the potential to set the country's economic growth trajectory off course,"" the survey says.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgy8p3pe71o,Myanmar villagers reveal 'desperate' illegal kidney sales,2025-02-25T22:15:53.746Z,BBC Burmese,"""I just wanted to own a house and pay off my debts - that's why I decided to sell my kidney,"" says Zeya, a farm worker in Myanmar. Prices had soared after a military coup in 2021 triggered civil war. He could barely feed his young family and was badly in debt. They all lived in his mother-in-law's house, in a village where thatched houses lined dirt roads, a few hours' drive from the country's largest city, Yangon. Zeya, whose name has been changed to conceal his identity, knew of local people who had sold one of their kidneys. ""They looked healthy to me,"" he says. So he started asking around. He is one of eight people in the area who told BBC Burmese they had sold a kidney by travelling to India. Illegal organ trading is a problem across Asia, and Zeya's story gives an insight into how it takes place. Buying or selling human organs is illegal in both Myanmar and India, but Zeya says he soon found a man he describes as a ""broker"". He says the man arranged medical tests and, a few weeks later, told him a potential recipient - a Burmese woman - had been found, and that both of them could travel to India for the surgery. In India, if the donor and recipient are not close relatives, they must demonstrate that the motive is altruistic and explain the relationship between them. Zeya says the broker forged a document, which every household in Myanmar must have, listing the details of family members. ""The broker put my name in the recipient's family tree,"" he explains. He says the broker made it appear as if he was donating to someone he was related to by marriage: ""Someone who is not a blood relative, but a distant relative"". Then, he says, the broker took him to meet the recipient in Yangon. There, he says a man who introduced himself as a doctor completed more paperwork and warned Zeya he would have to pay a substantial fee if he backed out. The BBC contacted this man afterwards, who said his role was to check whether a patient was fit to undergo the procedure, not to check the relationship between donor and recipient. Zeya says he was told he would receive 7.5m Myanmar kyats. This has been worth somewhere between $1,700 and $2,700 over the past couple of years - the unofficial exchange rate has fluctuated since the coup. He says he flew to northern India for the operation and it took place in a large hospital. All transplants involving foreign nationals in India must be approved by a panel called an authorisation committee, established either by the hospital or by local government. Zeya says he was interviewed, via a translator, by about four people. ""They asked me if I was willingly donating my kidney to her, not by force,"" he says. He says he explained the recipient was a relative and the transplant was approved. Zeya remembers the doctors administering the anaesthetic before he lost consciousness. ""There were no big issues after the surgery, except that I couldn't move without pain,"" he says, adding that he stayed in hospital for a week afterwards. Another donor, Myo Win - also not his real name - told the BBC he too had pretended to be related to a stranger. ""The broker gave me a piece of paper, and I had to memorise what was written on it,"" he says, adding that he was told to say the recipient was married to one of his relatives. ""The person assessing my case also called my mum, but the broker arranged a fake mum for the call,"" he says. He adds that the person who answered the call confirmed he was donating his kidney to a relative with her permission. Myo Win says he was offered the same amount of money as Zeya, but that it was described as a ""charitable donation"", and he had to pay the broker about 10% of the amount. Both men say they were given a third of the money up front. Myo Win says this was in his thoughts as he entered the operating theatre: ""I made up my mind that I had to do it because I had already taken their money."" He adds that he ""chose this desperate way"" as he was struggling with debt and medical bills for his wife. Unemployment rates have climbed in Myanmar since the coup - the war has ravaged the economy and sent foreign investors fleeing. In 2017, a quarter of the population were living in poverty - but by 2023, this had risen to half, according to the UN's development agency, UNDP. Myo Win says the broker did not tell him selling his kidney was illegal. ""I wouldn't have done it if he did. I am afraid of ending up in prison,"" he says. The BBC is not naming any of organisations or individuals involved in order to protect the anonymity and safety of the interviewees. However, another man in Myanmar, also speaking anonymously, told the BBC he had helped about 10 people buy or sell kidneys via surgery in India. He said he referred people to an ""agency"" in Mandalay in central Myanmar, which he said made arrangements. ""But don't worry about donors,"" he said. ""We have a list of donors who are queuing up to donate their kidneys."" He too said documents were faked to label strangers as related by marriage. When asked whether he received money for his help, he did not answer. Organ transplants have increased by more than 50% worldwide since 2010, with about 150,000 carried out annually, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). But it says the supply of organs meets only about 10% of global need. Trading in human body parts is illegal in nearly all countries and is hard to measure. In 2007, the WHO estimated that 5-10% of transplanted organs came from the black market, but the figure may be higher. Illegal kidney sales driven by poverty have been documented in recent years across Asia, including in Nepal, Pakistan, Indonesia, Afghanistan, India and Bangladesh. India has long been a hub for medical tourism and concern there about kidney sales has been rising, following accounts in media reports and a recent police investigation. Last July, Indian police said they had arrested seven people in connection with an alleged kidney racket, including an Indian doctor and her assistant. Police allege the group arranged for poor Bangladeshis to sell their kidneys, using forged documents to secure approval for the transplants. Dr Vijaya Rajakumari, who had been working at the prestigious Indraprastha Apollo Hospital in Delhi, is alleged to have carried out the operations as a visiting consultant at a different hospital, Yatharth, a few kilometres away. Her lawyer told the BBC the allegations ""are entirely baseless and without evidence"", that she only carried out surgeries approved by authorisation committees and always acted in accordance with the law. According to her bail order, she is not accused of preparing forged documents. Yatharth Hospital told the BBC all its cases, including those managed by visiting consultants, ""are subject to our robust protocols to ensure compliance with legal and ethical standards"". ""We have further enhanced our processes to prevent any such occurrences in the future,"" the hospital said. After her arrest, Apollo Hospitals said Dr Rajakumari was a freelance consultant engaged on a fee-for-service basis and it had discontinued all clinical engagements with her. Dr Rajakumari has not been charged in court. Last April, a senior health ministry official wrote to Indian states warning of a ""surge"" in transplants involving foreigners and calling for better monitoring. Under Indian law, foreign nationals who wish to donate or receive organs must have their documents, including those showing the relationship between donor and recipient, verified by their own country's embassy in India. The BBC contacted India's heath ministry and the National Organ and Tissue Transplant Organization, as well as Myanmar's military government for comment, but has received no response. A public health campaigner in Myanmar, Dr Thurein Hlaing Win, said: ""Law enforcement is not effective."" He added that potential donors need to be aware of the risks, including of bleeding during surgery and damage to other organs, adding that proper follow-up care is needed. The BBC last heard from Zeya several months after his surgery. ""I was able to settle my debts and bought a plot of land,"" he said. But he said he couldn't afford to build a house and had not been able to construct one while recovering from the surgery. He said he had been suffering from back pain. ""I have to restart working soon. If the side effects strike again, I have to deal with it. I have no regrets about it,"" he added. He said he stayed in touch with the recipient for a while, and she had told him she was in good health with his kidney. Speaking on condition of anonymity, she told the BBC she paid 100m kyats (between around $22,000 and $35,000 in recent years) in total. She denied that documents were forged, maintaining that Zeya was her relative. Six months after his surgery, Myo Win told the BBC he had paid off most of his debts, but not all. ""I have no job and not even a penny left,"" he said, adding that he had been experiencing some stomach problems since the surgery. He said he had no regrets, but then added: ""I am telling other people not to do this. It is not good."""

Around 50 workers had been working inside the 43km (26.7-mile)-long tunnel, located in Nagarkurnool district, when a part of its roof caved in early Saturday morning. Officials say 43 of them managed to come out safely but efforts to reach the remaining eight men have faced repeated setbacks due to loose soil, mud and slush inside the tunnel. They have also been unable to establish contact with the trapped men, or provide them with oxygen and other essential supplies. Jupally Krishna Rao, a state minister overseeing the rescue effort, told PTI news agency that ""the chances of their survival are very remote."" On Monday an expert team of ""rat-hole miners"" - people trained in narrow tunnel navigation - arrived to clear the debris and get to the workers. The same team had sucessfully rescued 41 construction workers trapped in a tunnel after a landslide in the Himalayan state of Uttarakhand in 2023. Approximately 33km of excavation has been completed so far and roughly 10km remain, officials said on Tuesday. Rescuers are using a train to get to a point from where they need to climb on to a conveyor belt to remove the debris. Reports say they are also continuously pumping out water to ensure oxygen supply within the tunnel. But the rough terrain of the region has slowed them down. As rescue efforts continue, families of the trapped workers - most of whom are daily wage workers - are anxiously waiting for news of their loved ones. ""I just hope that this time my son comes back safe. I will never send him away to earn again,"" said Rampratap Sahu, a resident of Jharkhand state. Others expressed anger at authorities for letting their family members ""come in harm's way"". ""Why did they send the men to work there when they knew of the risks involved in the project?"" asked Jaspreet Kaur, whose brother is among those trapped. A portion of the under-construction Srisailam Left Bank Canal (SLBC) collapsed around 13km from its opening at 8:30 local time (03:00 GMT) on Saturday. The accident took place after a slab of concrete covering seepage on the roof slipped and fell off. At least a dozen workers were injured in the chaos. The tunnel is part of the longest-running irrigation project of the Telangana government. Located in a hilly forested area, it passes through the Nagarjuna Sagar-Srisailam tiger reserve which is the largest in India. Officials said construction work had resumed just four days before the accident, after a gap of almost three years. Various relief teams, including personnel from the National Disaster Response Force, firefighters and soldiers from the Indian army, are at the spot. Officials told BBC Telugu that a team of firefighters was the first to go inside on Sunday. ""We covered 11km by train, 2km by conveyor belt and the remaining distance on foot,"" an official, who wanted to stay anonymous, said. ""But then we hit a roadblock."" ""There were tall mounds of mud and soft soil. The boring machine that was being used by the workers lay upside down, blocking all passage beyond."" The rescuers said they were forced to return from that point as they did not have the necessary tools and machines to clear the slush. ""We shouted and screamed, whistled and pointed torches, hoping for a response but didn't hear anything."" Relatives of some of the trapped men are now desperately hoping for a miracle. ""When I left home, my wife held me, wept and said, do not come back empty handed. Bring back my son,"" said Rampratap Sahu, father of one of the workers. ""But what can I do? I can only sit here and pray to god to return my son to me. I want nothing else."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9q47qleey8o,Bangladesh wooed by China as ties with India fray,2025-02-25T03:36:12.312Z,Ethirajan Anbarasan,"A 22-member Bangladeshi delegation of political leaders, civil society activists, academics and journalists have begun a 10-day visit to China. They will be having talks with Chinese government officials and senior members of the ruling Communist Party, a delegation leader confirmed with the BBC. Analysts say China is making overtures while diplomatic tensions have risen between Bangladesh and India on a range of issues. This includes ousted Bangladeshi leader Sheikh Hasina living in exile in India. Dhaka has requested her extradition but Delhi has refused. Abdul Moyeen Khan, a senior official from the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) who's leading the delegation in Beijing, told the BBC: ""It's basically a goodwill visit, initiated by Beijing."" ""It is unique because China this time has invited a team representing various groups in Bangladesh."" Many of the delegation members are from the BNP and its allies. The BNP, headed by former prime minister Begum Khaleda Zia, is one of the main parties in Bangladesh, besides the Awami League led by Hasina. The delegation also includes several representatives from the student movement that began the mass uprising against Hasina that eventually ousted the prime minister in August last year. An interim government led by the Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus is currently in charge. It has been urging India to repatriate Hasina to face charges of crimes against humanity and money laundering, among other allegations. The UN says Hasina's government's crackdown on protesters during the uprising killed about 1,400 people. So far India has showed no sign of extraditing Hasina, who denies the charges. Delhi and Dhaka had maintained close ties during the 15-year rule of Ms Hasina, who was widely seen by her critics as pro-India, although she also balanced it with her relationship with Beijing. Following the fall of Hasina, Beijing has stepped up its interaction with Bangladeshi leaders, activists and delegations, including those from Islamist parties. This week's visit follows a meeting between the Bangladesh interim government's foreign policy advisor Touhid Hossain and the Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi in Beijing in January. It also marks the second time BNP officials have visited China in recent months, after Beijing hosted a BNP delegation late last year. With the political vacuum and absence of India's influence, analysts say, Beijing is trying to increase its foothold in Bangladesh, a country of about 170 million people. China is Bangladesh's largest trading partner with bilateral trade amounting to around $24bn (£19bn) - the vast majority of that consists of Chinese exports to the South Asian country. The Bangladeshi military also heavily relies on Chinese equipment and ammunition with more than 70% of supplies coming from China.  Compared to Beijing's overtures, India has had very limited interactions with the interim government and other Bangladeshi political leaders in the past six months. The BNP held a protest in December alleging India's interference in Bangladesh's internal matters by hosting Hasina. Some advisors of the interim government have also criticised Delhi on the same issue. This criticism has sparked sharp reaction from Delhi. The Indian foreign minister Subrahmanyam Jaishankar said last week that it was up to Bangladesh to decide on ""what kind of relationship they want with us"". He described the criticism of India by Bangladeshi officials and politicians as ""absolutely ridiculous"". Some argue that this increasingly tense rhetoric between Dhaka and Delhi could push Bangladesh towards China. The latest events indicate that Bangladesh has joined fellow South Asian countries Sri Lanka, the Maldives and Nepal as a target for both Delhi and Beijing, as the superpowers jostle for influence. ""I don't believe India should consider the whole subcontinent is under Delhi's sphere of influence. That attitude would make India suffer,"" Chinese analyst Zhou Bo, a senior fellow at Beijing's Tsinghua University, told the BBC."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9depxjegw9o,Is India v Pakistan still cricket's greatest rivalry?,2025-02-25T00:25:13.068Z,Soutik Biswas,"Roaring crowds, faces painted blue and green, flags waving like battle standards. This is the opening of The Greatest Rivalry: India v Pakistan, a new Netflix documentary on one of cricket's most storied contests. India's Virender Sehwag sets the tone: ""This is a contest bigger than one between the bat and ball"". Cut to dramatic footage of some of the matches, the Wagah border, partition refugees. A nation split into two, but forever bound by cricket. Pakistan's Waqar Younis doesn't hesitate: ""I put this rivalry right at the top. There's no match like India v Pakistan."" India's R Ashwin agrees: ""I think this is bigger than the Ashes."" Ramiz Raja says it's ""the political garnish that makes this rivalry world-class"". Despite wars, border standoffs and terror attacks, the India-Pakistan cricket rivalry has endured, driven by history and national pride. Even when politics halts the bilateral series, International Cricket Council (ICC) tournaments keep the fire alive, turning every match into a high-stakes spectacle. But Pakistan's crushing defeat by India on Sunday at the Champions Trophy has reignited the question: is this rivalry overhyped, propped up by slogans like ""war minus the shooting"" - a phrase George Orwell coined in 1945 to criticise excessive nationalism in sports? Is this still the premier clash in cricket, or just one of its most dramatic? Has it lost its competitive edge, running more on history than intensity? Consider this. From an eight-wicket thrashing in 2018 to a 228-run demolition in 2023, India has dominated, winning six of the last eight ODIs. Pakistan's last victory? The 2017 Champions Trophy final - a fading memory in an increasingly one-sided rivalry. What rivalry, asked Dawn - a leading Pakistani newspaper - pointedly after the latest debacle. A cricket war that's now just a big yawn, headlined India Today magazine. The loss would be easier to accept if Pakistan were at least putting up a fight, according to Dawn's Zohaib Ahmed Majeed. Majeed believes the troubled politics between the two neighbours is the only thing that has kept the rivalry alive. ""In a way we must thank the politicians of these two nations for keeping this rivalry alive, because the cricketers, especially from our side, are certainly incapable of putting up a show that is worthy of its billing,"" he wrote. ""Cut out the war of words and the actual wars and what you'll be left with is a professional cricketing unit against a haphazardly put together team at the last minute. There is no rivalry as far as pure cricketing merits are concerned."" India Today was no less acerbic. ""With its history of one-sided losses to India in recent years, Pakistan cricket is fast sliding into pity territory. And unless it reverses the trend, Pakistan's dream of competing with India could soon turn into a butt of jokes for cricket fans,"" wrote Sandipan Sharma. To be true, Pakistan's cricketing woes keep mounting. They have missed the final four in the last three ODI World Cups, crashed out in the T20 World Cup group stage and now, as hosts of the Champions Trophy, they've hit rock-bottom. Since the 2009 attack on Sri Lanka's team bus, Pakistan cricket has battled isolation, political turmoil, board instability, frequent coaching changes and selection controversies - all adding to its struggles. Meanwhile, across the border, India has risen as cricket's powerhouse, backed by a strong domestic system and the IPL, cricket's richest international league. Pakistani cricket writer Osman Samiuddin also notes a sense of ""marginalisation"" among his country's cricketers, who remain excluded from the IPL and its franchise ecosystem (no Pakistani player has featured in the IPL since 2009, as they were banned after the Mumbai terror attacks). ""I think they see Indian cricketers and others as well, like Australian and English cricketers, as partaking in a world of cricket they have been excluded from,"" he told a programme. This has all contributed to the team's fast-declining fortunes. ""It is a futile exercise to wonder if this is the lowest Pakistan cricket has ever been. However, even when Pakistan have plummeted to spectacular lows in the past, they have done it in a way that justifies the cliché of their mercurial nature,"" wrote Sidharth Monga in ESPNcricinfo, after Sunday's game. ""This slide just feels like a terminal, slow decline. Players are not fighting with each other, there is no backdoor intrigue, there are no cliques in the team plotting to dethrone the captain, there are no comical run-outs or misfields, no defeats snatched from the jaws of victory."" The ""war without guns"" narrative once held weight, especially when Imran Khan's Pakistan, armed with a fearsome pace attack of Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis and batting stars like Javed Miandad and Inzamam-ul-Haq, regularly got the better of India. ""The narrative may have been true till the early 2000s because this is how the actual fans felt. But it was soon hijacked by the multinationals and the media to cash in on the hyper-pathos of it all,"" Nadeem Farooq Paracha, Pakistani author and columnist, told me. ""The quality of cricket between the two sides isn't the same anymore. Indian cricket continues to get better. In fact, I think the narrative in question here has ended up pressuring Pakistani side more. They underplay it, even though they're more than willing to pocket its financial benefits."" The cricket boards and broadcasters are doing all they can to keep the rivalry alive, and the ICC won't dial down the hype - it's too valuable in an era of overexposure of cricket, limited stars and competition from franchise cricket. This one game has become a financial juggernaut, fuelling a parallel economy wherever it's played - Dubai, London, Ahmedabad - drawing fans who spend big just to be there. ""Pakistan has talent, but the contest now feels more psychological,"" says cricket writer Gautam Bhattacharyya. Brand consultant Santosh Desai feels the real contest between the arch rivals plays out beyond the cricket ground and the ""rivalry thrives more in imagination than in reality"". ""The asymmetry [between the two sides] only fuels the hype. India's dominance makes it an easy narrative to sell, a battle royale where the outcome feels preordained. If Pakistan were winning consistently, the marketing appeal would fade. The rivalry's commercial power lies in India's superiority, feeding a script designed for validation, not uncertainty,"" Desai told me. India's vice-captain Shubman Gill dismisses talk of overhyping, calling it a contest fans love to watch. ""It is an exciting contest when both of these teams play. Everyone enjoys watching it. If so many people are happy to watch the match, then who are we to say that it is underhyped or overhyped,"" he told reporters on eve of Sunday's game. Gill is possibly right. Tickets for India-Pakistan games still fly off the shelves - the ICC reported sellouts within minutes. An astonishing 600 plus million viewers tuned in to watch Sunday's match on Indian streaming platform JioHotstar, setting new records. But for now, as cricket writer Ayaz Memon puts it, ""the hype is more thrilling than the cricket itself""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4lp2pw9pko,Taliban says it will try to release British couple as soon as possible,2025-02-24T17:55:24.600Z,Maia Davies,"The Taliban has told the BBC it will endeavour to release two British nationals who have been arrested and held in Afghanistan ""as soon as possible"". Peter Reynolds, 79, and his wife Barbie, 75, were arrested on 1 February while returning to their home in the country's Bamiyan province. An American national and an Afghan were also arrested alongside the couple, a spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior Affairs said. The UK Foreign Office said on Monday it was supporting their family. In a statement, Taliban official Abdul Mateen Qani said: ""A series of considerations is being taken into account, and after evaluation, we will endeavour to release them as soon as possible."" All three foreign nationals had Afghan passports and national ID cards, he added. The reason for Mr and Mrs Reynolds's arrest has not been confirmed. The couple had been running training projects in Afghanistan for 18 years, including one that involved training mothers and children. Their work had apparently been approved by the local authorities, despite the Taliban banning education for girls over the age of 12 and not allowing women to work. The Taliban announced women would be banned from working for non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in 2022. Last December, it said it would close any NGOs employing women. The pair married in Kabul in 1970. They remained in Afghanistan after the Taliban's return to power in August 2021, which saw most westerners leave the country. Their daughter, Sarah Entwistle, told the BBC she had not heard from her parents in more than two weeks. They had communicated by text after the pair were initially arrested, but contact stopped after three days. Ms Entwistle and her siblings wrote to the Taliban to plead for their parents' release. ""We recognise that there have been instances where exchanges have been beneficial for your government and western nations,"" they wrote. ""However, our parents have consistently expressed their commitment to Afghanistan, stating that they would rather sacrifice their lives than become part of ransom negotiations or be traded."" On Monday, Ms Entwistle said they had wanted to give the Taliban an opportunity ""to explain their reasons,"" because Mr and Mrs Reynolds had ""always sought to honour"" the group. But she said they could no longer wait, telling Times Radio: ""We are now urgently calling on the British consulate to do everything in their power to get us answers and to put as much pressure as they can on the Taliban for their release"". The UK shut its embassy in Kabul and withdrew its diplomats from the country after the Taliban returned to power. The Foreign Office says support for British nationals in Afghanistan is therefore ""severely limited"" and advises against all travel to the country. Additional reporting by Mahfouz Zubaide."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg1xjpnkl2o,UK and India relaunch trade talks in Delhi,2025-02-24T10:54:25.356Z,Nikita Yadav,"India and the UK have restarted free trade talks, nearly a year after negotiations were paused ahead of general elections in both countries. Jonathan Reynolds, the UK's business and trade secretary, met his Indian counterpart Piyush Goyal in Delhi on Monday and kicked off the two-day discussions. The talks focused on ""advancing"" the negotiations and ensuring that the deal was ""balanced, ambitious and mutually beneficial"", Goyal wrote on X. The countries have held more than a dozen rounds of negotiations since 2022, but an agreement has remained out of reach. Sticking points include high tariffs in India on Scotch whisky and relaxing fees and visa rules for Indian students and professionals going to the UK. Talks are being held for the first time after the Labour Party came to power in the UK and Reynolds says securing a deal is a ""top priority"" for his government. ""Growth will be the guiding principle in our trade negotiations with India and I'm excited about the opportunities on offer in this vibrant market,"" he said in a statement ahead of the meeting. India is forecast to become the world's third-largest economy in a few years. The ministers held a joint press conference after the meeting, but neither side offered a deadline for talks to conclude. Deadlines set by former ministers Boris Johnson and Liz Truss had passed without an agreement being finalised. For Delhi, the trade talks have assumed renewed significance on the back of US President Donald Trump's decision to impose reciprocal or tit-for-tat tariffs on imported goods from countries, including India. The UK is also a high-priority trading partner for Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government, which has an ambitious target to grow exports by $1 trillion by FY30. The UK had announced in November last year - soon after Sir Keir Starmer met PM Modi at the G20 summit in Brazil - that talks would restart in the new year. The two countries share a trade relationship worth £41bn ($52bn) currently, according to a UK government statement, and a trade deal could unlock new opportunities for both countries. London has identified sectors that could benefit, which include advanced manufacturing, clean energy and professional and trade services. An agreement could also potentially unlock a valuable market for British cars, Scotch whisky and financial services worth billions of dollars. India is seeking greater mobility for its working professionals and students to the UK, while pushing for faster visa processing times. It may also seek concessions for its residents working temporarily in the UK on business visas, who are required to pay national insurance but are still ineligible for social benefits. Speaking at the joint conference, Goyal said that immigration was not a part of the discussions. ""India has never ever discussed immigration in any free trade negotiations,"" he said. Reynolds added that business mobility was a ""separate issue"" from immigration. During Reynolds' visit, he and Goyal will also visit the BT office in the northern Indian city of Gurugram. UK Investment Minister Poppy Gustafsson is also in India and will be participating in events in India's two big business hubs - Mumbai and Bengaluru. After years of scepticism over free trade deals, India has been signing agreements or is in talks with several countries or blocs. Last year, it signed a $100bn free trade agreement with the European Free Trade Association - a group of four European countries that are not members of the European Union - after almost 16 years of negotiations. It is also set to resume negotiations with the European Union this year. Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce30l5497x2o,NZ minister resigns after he 'placed hand' on staff's arm,2025-02-24T07:07:09.166Z,Koh Ewe Kathryn Armstrong,"New Zealand's commerce minister Andrew Bayly has resigned as a government minister after he ""placed a hand"" on a staff member's upper arm last week, in what he described as ""overbearing"" behaviour. Bayly said on Monday that he was ""deeply sorry"" about the incident, which he described as not an argument but an ""animated discussion"". He remains a member of parliament. His resignation comes after he was criticised last October for calling a winery worker a ""loser""- including putting his fingers in an 'L' shape on his forehead - and allegedly using an expletive directed at them. He later issued a public apology. ""As many of you know, I have been impatient to drive change in my ministerial portfolios,"" Bayly said in a statement announcing his resignation. ""Last week I had an animated discussion with a staff member about work. I took the discussion too far, and I placed a hand on their upper arm, which was inappropriate."" He said a complaint had been made but would not elaborate further on exactly what had happened. Bayly resigned last Friday, New Zealand Prime Minister Christopher Luxon later told a press conference, adding that the incident happened three days earlier, on 18 February. Luxon said on Monday the government's handling the issue within a week was ""pretty quick"" and ""pretty impressive"". He denied that he should have asked Bayly to step down following October's winery incident, and said ""never say never"" when asked if there was a way back for the 63-year-old into another cabinet position. However, Labour leader Chris Hipkins criticised Luxon as being ""incredibly weak"", saying the incident with the staff member should not have been dragged over the weekend. ""Christopher Luxon has once again set the bar for ministerial behaviour so low, that it would be almost impossible not to get over it,"" he told reporters on Monday. Bayly himself said that he had to talk to his family and ""would have had difficulty"" speaking to the media earlier. He was first elected to the New Zealand Parliament in 2014 as an MP for the current ruling National Party. He was appointed the Minister of Commerce and Consumer Affairs, Minister for Small Business and Manufacturing, and Minister of Statistics following Luxon's election in late 2023. He was also appointed minister for the ACC - the national accidental injury compensation scheme - following a cabinet reshuffle earlier this year. Before joining politics, Bayly worked in the finance industry. Luxon said Scott Simpson, National's senior whip, would take over the ACC and Commerce and Consumer Affairs portfolios. Bayly is the first minister to resign of his own accord under PM Luxon, whose favourability has dipped considerably, according to recent polls. Both the 1News-Verian poll and the Post/Freshwater Strategy poll show his National-led coalition government is losing support among voters. The government has recently come under fire for some policies that were seen by some as anti-Māori, including the introduction of a bill that many argued undermined Māori rights and the dissolution of the Māori Health Authority - which was set up under the last Labour government to try and create greater health equality."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gwj2qy9pxo,Why a mega river-linking plan has sparked massive protests in India,2025-02-24T02:15:32.226Z,Vishnukant Tiwari,"Thousands of villagers in the central Indian state of Madhya Pradesh are protesting against a multi-million-dollar river-linking project which, they say, will rob them of their homes and livelihoods. The Ken-Betwa project, with a budget of 440bn rupees ($5.06bn; £4.05bn), will channel excess water from the Ken river in Madhya Pradesh to the Betwa river in the neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state through a network of tunnels, canals and a dam. It is the first of 16 such river-linking projects earmarked under India's National Perspective Plan for water resource development in the 1980s. The plan faced multiple delays - mainly due to environmental concerns and political disputes - before the government cleared it in 2021. Prime Minister Narendra Modi laid the foundation stone for its construction in December last year. The project is supposed to help the drought-prone Bundelkhand region - which includes parts of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh - where arid climate and unpredictable rainfall patterns have led to decades of poverty and underdevelopment. The government says that once completed in 2030, it will help irrigate 1.06 million hectares of land, provide drinking water to 6.2 million people and generate 130MW of hydropower and solar energy. But at least 10 villages, including vast swathes of precious forest land, will be submerged to build the dam's reservoir and 11 more villages will be displaced for constructing the canal, affecting more than 7,000 families, district officials say. ""Our livelihoods are tied to this land - we don't know what the future holds for us anymore,"" said Tulsi Adivasi, who is among the thousands of villagers protesting against the project. Most of them belong to the indigenous Gond and Kol tribes, who live along the edge of forests and depend on farming for a living. Environmental experts warn the project will submerge nearly 98 sq km (38 sq miles) of the Panna Tiger Reserve, a 543 sq km sanctuary that successfully brought tigers back from local extinction in 2009. This could undo years of conservation efforts. ""It's unprecedented. We have never seen a core area of a national park being used for such a large-scale infrastructure project before,"" says environmentalist Amit Bhatnagar. In 2019, a panel of experts constituted by India's top court had also raised concerns about the project, questioning its economic viability and impact on the region's wildlife. The government, it said, should explore alternative irrigation methods in the river basin. Independent studies on river-linking projects in India have made similar observations. A 2023 study published in the Nature Communications journal states that such endeavours ""may worsen the water stress across the country, making these projects ineffective or possibly even counterproductive"". Baleshwar Thakur, who heads the National Water Development Agency, however, defended the project, saying authorities had conducted a thorough research and acquired all environmental clearances for the project. ""We have also designated additional land to offset the loss of tiger habitats and will rehabilitate other species affected by the project as well,"" he said. The government official admitted that there would be a potential ""challenge"" to the biodiversity of the region, but said that ""the benefits of the project outweigh the adverse impacts"". The assurances have done little to comfort the villagers. In the heart of Daudhan, 48-year-old Mahesh Adivasi sat with a group of men, who voiced their dissent in the form of a protest song. ""Ken-Betwa dam is built by the government, it gives others water but drowns us,"" they sang, the lyrics capturing their anguish. The village is one of the poorest areas in the region, lacking basic facilities such as clean drinking water and electricity. The bitter irony of the river project isn't lost on its people - they ask why they are being asked to abandon their homes to provide electricity in 13 other districts when their own village has never had power. ""We have seen generations pass without progress. Now, we are being asked to sacrifice our lives for others' progress. What about us?"" Mahesh Adivasi said. The government has offered villagers an optional compensation plan, where they can either opt for a piece of land along with 750,000 rupees ($8,655; £6,842) or a one-time payout of 1,250,000 rupees. For those who own land, an additional amount based on the land's value will also be given. Mr Thakur said that about 90% of the people had chosen to take the lump sum amount. ""In the meantime, the government has started looking for alternative government land to resettle the villagers,"" he added. But locals say the amount being offered is insufficient. Tulsi Adivasi showed BBC Hindi a government notice which evaluated his house at 46,000 rupees. ""Can a house be built with this much money?"" he asked. Others complain they have not been informed when they must evacuate or where they'd be resettled, fuelling anxieties about their future. ""The project should have been a blessing for our village but, the truth is, it will plunge us further into darkness,"" said Lakshmi Adivasi, 20. Questions have also been raised against the claim that the project is meant to channel excess water from the Ken river. Critics point out that the government has relied on outdated data from 2003, without independent verification, to calculate the river's annual yield. Mr Thakur denied the allegation and said authorities ""have all the data to continue with the project"". Mr Bhatnagar, the environmentalist, said that by going ahead with the project, the government was setting ""a dangerous precedent"" for similar development programmes to be carried out in other geologically sensitive areas.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0nzmmzvyno,Is the downfall of a Japanese star a turning point for women's rights?,2025-02-24T00:28:14.848Z,Shaimaa Khalil,"For months, Japan's entertainment industry has been rocked by a scandal that unseated one of its most popular celebrities and put one of its biggest broadcasters at risk. But some believe it has also marked a turning point in how cases of sexual assault are perceived in Japan - where traditionally victims have been shamed into silence. At its heart was Masahiro Nakai, a household name and leading presenter for Fuji TV, one of the country's biggest broadcasters. Nakai, who is also a former member of J-pop boy band SMAP, was accused of sexually assaulting a woman at a dinner party in 2023. The revelations, which appeared last December in the weekly tabloid magazine Josei Seven and were then picked up by the Shukan Bunshun, marked the latest of a series of scandals involving celebrities in Japan, including that of late entertainment mogul Johnny Kitagawa, who was found by investigators to have abused hundreds of boys and young men over six decades. Nakai didn't admit guilt and denied using force against the woman. But he apologised for ""causing trouble"" in a statement and said that he had ""resolved"" the matter in a settlement, reportedly worth more than half a million dollars. But as public anger mounted, he was forced to announce his retirement from the entertainment industry in January. Another channel, the Tokyo Broadcasting System, has also stopped airing a program that Nakai regularly appeared on as an MC. The impact on Fuji TV has been devastating. The broadcaster's reputation is now in ruins. Its revenue is under threat and some of its top executives have also been forced to step down. High-profile companies like Nissan and Toyota were among those who pulled advertising from the broadcaster as outrage grew. Fuji TV has since admitted it allowed Nakai to continue presenting shows even after finding out about the allegations. ""If this had happened 10 years ago, there would not have been this outcry,"" Keiko Kojima, who worked in Japan's media industry for 15 years as a TV presenter, told the BBC. Sexual violence against women is one of Japan's worst-kept secrets. A 2020 survey claimed that more than 70% of sexual assaults in the country go unreported. And according to a 2024 study published in the International Journal of Asian Studies, for every 1,000 rapes in Japan, only 10–20 result in a criminal conviction – and fewer than half of convicted rapists are incarcerated. ""There's still a prevalent attitude of 'Shoganai ' or 'there's nothing you can do' that is being projected on women - so they're encouraged to keep silent,"" Machiko Osawa, professor emeritus at Japan Women's University in Tokyo, told the BBC. She added that women were seldom believed and did not have proper mechanisms to even report such incidents, which contributed to this culture of silence. Ms Kojima said that the media industry, in particular, has long had a culture of impunity and lack of accountability where many young women felt they must keep silent to keep their jobs. ""It was common for men to make rude comments about women's bodies or appearance or age. I remember my colleagues and I being asked how many people we've had sex with,"" she said. ""We were expected to reply with a sense of humour without getting angry or offended. I saw sexual harassment and other forms of derogatory treatment of women on a daily basis. For a woman, adapting to these situations was the only way to become a full-fledged TV or media professional."" The Fuji TV case has also raised questions about dinners and drinking parties involving celebrities and young women - and how common they were. Although Shukan Bunshun retracted an earlier report that claimed the alleged assault took place at a party organised by Fuji TV, Ms Kojima told the BBC that it was indeed common to use women as ""tools for entertaining"". ""In Japanese working culture, it's an everyday practice to half-forcibly take young female employees to events to entertain clients,"" she said. ""Men are happy when young women join them. The idea that women are like a gift and that taking a young woman with you is a way of offering hospitality to the other person is very common."" That is why the fallout from this scandal has encouraged women's rights activists. Minori Kitahara, one of the founders of the Flower Demo movement - where groups of sexual violence survivors and their supporters gather in public spaces on the 11th of every month - admitted she was surprised at how swiftly and severely the sponsors reacted. ""Even if it's more of self-preservation than human rights for sponsors, this is a turning point for the MeToo movement in Japan,"" she told the BBC. ""It's up to us how big we make it."" Nearly 50 companies have walked away from the now-tarnished Fuji TV. The Japanese government has also withdrawn all its recent and planned advertisements with the network. And it has called on the broadcaster to regain the trust of viewers and sponsors. So far Fuji TV seems to have done neither. The scandal and Fuji TV's role in hiding it have sent the company on a crisis-management frenzy that seems to have led to deeper disgrace, fuelling even more public anger. Fuji TV president Koichi Minato admitted that the company had known about the allegation shortly after the alleged incident. But he said they chose not to disclose it at the time because they ""prioritised the woman's physical and mental recovery as well as the protection of her privacy."" After a press conference held in the hope of defusing the outrage turned into a PR disaster, the company held a second one that lasted 10 hours. It was intended to show remorse. Both Fuji TV's chairman Shuji Kano and its President Koichi Minato stepped down, bowing humbly as they announced their resignations. The firm said its executive vice-president Kenji Shimizu would replace Mr Minato as president. But this was seen as a mere face-saving exercise to appease advertisers rather than a sign of substantial change - especially because the president's replacement belonged to the same leadership cadre. Professor Osawa told the BBC, however, that high-profile cases like Fuji TV become important precedents for real change. And this is the latest saga in a series of prominent sexual misconduct cases that have generated conversation about women's rights in Japan. These include the case of journalist Shiori Ito, who became a symbol of the country's MeToo movement in 2017. She took the rare step of going public with allegations that Noriyuki Yamaguchi, a well-known TV journalist, had raped her after she met him for drinks. While he denied the allegations, she won a civil lawsuit against him in 2019 ""People have now started to realise that it was OK to speak out and say that this [sexual harassment] is a problem. We are changing what we take as the norm,"" Ms Kojima said. But Ms Kojima and Ms Kitahara both say that Japan is not moving fast enough. ""I think it's time for that generation [of media leadership] to step down. The industry needs to create a new corporate culture. The change is slow,"" Ms Kojima said. ""The TV industry has long neglected the issue of exploitation and violence and has not dealt with the victims properly. If the root of the problem doesn't change, the same will happen again."" Professor Osawa agrees that Japan still has a long way to go because of the ubiquitous power imbalance in the country. She adds that while women have been part of the workforce for decades they're still seen as the ""caretakers"" and men as the ""breadwinners"" by a society that is heavily shaped by patriarchal values. ""This is an important time... But it's unclear how far attitudes will change,"" she said. While Ms Kitahara is hopeful, she says she's also angry: ""The sexual violence never stops."" ""I still meet new survivors at Flower Demo [protests] every month and learn what happened to them. We had a high school girl other day. When we started the movement [in 2019] she was probably in junior high, "" she said. ""I hope for the day when I will never have to go to a Flower Demo protest again."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rznw4j2e4o,British couple in their 70s arrested by Taliban,2025-02-23T19:55:59.274Z,Emma Rossiter Leigh Milner,"A British couple in their 70s have been arrested by the Taliban in Afghanistan. Peter Reynolds, 79, and his wife Barbie, 75, were returning to their home in Bamiyan on 1 February when they were detained. The couple have been running training projects in Afghanistan for 18 years and their daughter, Sarah Entwistle, told the BBC she had not heard from her parents in more than two weeks. It is not known exactly what the couple were arrested for but projects run by them include one training mothers and children, which had apparently been approved by the local authorities despite a ban by the Taliban on women working and on education for girls older than the age of 12. The couple, who originally met at the University of Bath, married in Kabul in 1970. Since 2009 they have been running training projects in five schools in Kabul and one project in Bamiyan training mothers and children. While the Taliban's return to power in August 2021 saw most of their staff leave – along with most westerners – Mr and Mrs Reynolds insisted on staying put. After their arrest, the couple were initially able to keep in touch with their four children by text message. The family knew that their parents were being held by the interior ministry and were assured by them that they were ""fine"". Three days later, however, the texts stopped. The children have heard nothing since. Ms Entwistle, who lives in Daventry, Northamptonshire, told the BBC: ""It's been over two weeks since the messages stopped, and they were taken into custody. ""We would like the Taliban to release them to go back to their home and continue their work."" She told the Sunday Times: ""They said they could not leave when Afghans were in their hour of need. ""They were meticulous about keeping by the rules even as they kept changing."" She added: ""My mother is 75 and my father almost 80 and [he] needs his heart medication after a mini-stroke. They were just trying to help the country they loved. The idea they are being held because they were teaching mothers with children is outrageous."" The couple were arrested alongside their American friend Faye Hall and a translator from their business, the PA news agency reported, quoting an employee. The employee, who described the pair as ""the most honourable people I have ever met"", said Mr Reynolds had been denied access to heart medication and his condition was ""not good"". Ms Entwistle and her three siblings have written a letter to the Taliban, pleading with them to release their parents. ""We do not understand the reasons behind their arrest,"" they wrote. ""They have communicated their trust in you, and that as Afghan citizens they will be treated well."" ""We recognise that there have been instances where exchanges have been beneficial for your government and western nations. However, our parents have consistently expressed their commitment to Afghanistan, stating that they would rather sacrifice their lives than become part of ransom negotiations or be traded."" The Foreign Office is aware two British nationals have been detained in Afghanistan. But assistance is limited by the fact that the UK does not recognise the Taliban and has no embassy in Kabul. Taliban official sources have told the BBC they arrested British nationals, who they believe were working for a non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Bamiyan province. An official claimed they had been arrested, about 20 days ago, after using a plane without informing Bamiyan police headquarters or the border security forces. The Taliban announced women would be banned from working for NGOs in 2022 and in December last year Al Jazeera reported the government had said it would close any NGOs employing women."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3llmg140o,India v Pakistan: Cricket's ultimate grudge match in the desert,2025-02-22T01:04:20.943Z,Gautam Bhattacharyya,"The last time India and Pakistan clashed in a major ICC 50-over contest was in 2023, at the highly anticipated World Cup league match in Ahmedabad. As a contest, it turned out to be a bit of an anti-climax - India, in dominant form, comfortably chased down a subpar Pakistan target, securing a resounding victory. And as Pakistani fans didn't get visas to travel to India, aside from the cricket team, the country's only notable presence was in the media centre. Sunday's ICC Champions Trophy clash between the arch-rivals at Dubai International Stadium promises a vastly different atmosphere. The International Cricket Council (ICC) reported that tickets sold out within minutes - and with the UAE hosting more than 3.7 million Indians and nearly 1.7 million Pakistanis, a vibrant and well-represented crowd from both nations is all but guaranteed. But can a sea of green flags in the stands inspire Pakistan's Mohammad Rizwan's men to defy the odds in this must-win clash against Rohit Sharma's India? Pakistan can take comfort in their strong head-to-head record in UAE - 19 wins in 28 ODIs, plus a lone T20I victory in the 2021 World Cup in Dubai. Most of Pakistan's wins against India came at Sharjah during their dominant run in the 1980s and '90s, winning 18 of 24 games there. In Dubai, India beat them twice in the 2018 Asia Cup, while both teams won a game each in a 2006 Abu Dhabi series. Since Pakistan's glory days in Sharjah, the tide has shifted - apart from the occasional T20I win, India has largely dominated in the new millennium. Veteran cricket writer Ayaz Memon feels there is no reason to look at India-Pakistan clashes in the UAE through the prism of the past. ''There is no doubt that Pakistan enjoyed tremendous crowd support in the Sharjah days, with the local Pathan population making up the numbers. However, the team then boasted of the likes of Imran Khan, Javed Miandad, Saeed Anwar, Aamer Sohail and the two Ws [Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis],"" Memon says. ""Compare that to the state of the current team, which comes up with some exceptional results from time to time but lacks any form of consistency."" The glitzy, ever-expanding United Arab Emirates city-state of Dubai offers little sign of a major cricket event - there are no welcome banners at the airport. Instead, hoardings of Jannik Sinner, Iga Swiatek and company dominate, as the city is in full swing for the annual Dubai Duty Free Tennis Championships. Head south, and the 'Ring of Fire' at Dubai International Stadium emerges from the highway, signalling cricket's presence. Towering images of all eight captains line the arena, but for the next two days, all eyes will be on Rohit Sharma and Mohammed Rizwan's teams as fans worldwide await their fate. It's no secret that catering to broadcasters and marketing demands, the ICC consistently places India and Pakistan in the same group for major tournaments. This ensures at least one high-stakes league clash, with the potential for a blockbuster rematch in the knockouts. At a time when cricket faces overexposure and its international structure is threatened by the rise of T20 franchise leagues, the India-Pakistan rivalry remains its biggest box-office draw. A big plus about the tight, top-eight team format of the ICC Champions Trophy is that a little slip-up can cost even the heavyweights dear. ''The 50-over World Cup gives you a chance to pull back even if you stumble in the odd game as there are 10 games in the fray. It's much different here where all three of your group matches are important to proceed to the semi-finals,'' India captain Sharma said on the eve of their opening match against Bangladesh. India cleared their first hurdle with a six-wicket win against Bangladesh on Thursday, powered by Shubman Gill's classy century (cementing his status as a future ODI captain), Mohammed Shami's five-wicket haul and a quickfire cameo from skipper Sharma, who crossed the 11,000-run mark in the format. Jasprit Bumrah's absence - expected as he recovers from a back spasm sustained in the final Test in Australia - remains a talking point. However, on this wicket, the spotlight is set to shift to the spinners. Pakistan's lead-up to the tournament has been a rollercoaster - both unpredictable and vulnerable. Their last three ODIs paint the picture perfectly. Ten days ago, Rizwan and Salman Ali Agha's stunning 260-run stand powered Pakistan to a record 353-run chase against South Africa in Karachi, securing a spot in the Tri-series final. But just two days later, they faltered, looking ordinary as New Zealand cruised to a five-wicket win, denying them a confidence boosting title ahead of the Champions Trophy. Then on Wednesday, after their bowlers made early inroads, they let the Kiwis off the hook, eventually crashing to a 60-run defeat in their tournament opener. This has put their backs against the wall ahead of the big game - and what has irked former Pakistan greats is captain Rizwan's statement that they will take the India match as ""just another game"". History shows that Pakistan thrives in such situations, echoing Imran Khan's legendary ""caged tigers"" rallying cry from their triumphant 1992 World Cup campaign. Yes, the odds favour India, but Pakistan can never be written off on UAE soil. After all, it's a new day, a fresh battle, and anything can happen in a big game."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9vde5y1ezo,Trump's '$21m for voter turnout' claim triggers political row in India,2025-02-21T10:51:50.151Z,Cherylann Mollan,"US President Donald Trump's remark that his country spent $21m to boost voter turnout in India's elections has triggered a political slugfest in the country. He made the remark days after a team led by Elon Musk said it had cancelled the payout as part of its crackdown on a US agency providing foreign aid. India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) called the payout an ""external interference"" and accused the opposition Congress party of seeking this intervention. The Congress denied the allegation, calling Trump's claims ""nonsensical"". The US has not provided any evidence to support its claim. On Friday, India's foreign ministry said it found the claims ""deeply troubling"". Foreign ministry spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said it was ""premature"" to make public statements about the matter at this stage and that relevant authorities were investigating it. Trump vowed to boost the US economy and soon after returning to office, he created the Department of Government Efficiency (Doge), led by Musk, to slash federal spending and jobs. Musk says Doge's mission is to save taxpayer money and cut national debt. One of its biggest moves - now making global headlines - is a crackdown on USAID, the US agency overseeing humanitarian aid since the 1960s. Musk, who has called USAID a ""criminal organisation"", announced on Sunday that funding for several projects had been cancelled. The cuts included $486m for the ""Consortium for Elections and Political Process Strengthening"", with ""$21m for voter turnout in India"" and ""$22m for inclusive and participatory political process in Moldova"". Defending Doge's cuts, Trump said India ""had a lot of money"" and was among the world's highest-taxing nations. On Thursday, he doubled down, questioning the $21m spend on ""India's voter turnout"". The latest comments came a week after Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's first Washington visit under Trump's second term, where Trump announced expanded military sales, increased energy exports and plans for a trade deal and new defence framework. ""I guess they were trying to get somebody else elected. We have got to tell the Indian government,"" the US president said at a summit in Miami. The same day, BJP leader Amit Malviya shared a clip of Congress leader Rahul Gandhi speaking at an event in London before the 2024 general election. In the clip, Gandhi can be heard saying that major democracies like the US and European countries were ""oblivious that a huge chunk of democratic model has come undone [in India]"". ""Rahul Gandhi was in London, urging foreign powers - from the US to Europe - to intervene in India's internal affairs,"" Malviya alleged in his post on X. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh dismissed the claim and urged the government to report on USAID's decades-long support to governmental and non-governmental institutions during PM Modi's tenure. Despite widespread reports, neither Doge nor Trump has provided evidence that USAID gave India $21m for voter turnout. India's poll panel has not responded, but former election chief SY Qureshi denied receiving such funding during his tenure, which ran from 2010 to 2012. Earlier, Malviya claimed that in 2012, under Mr Qureshi, the panel signed an agreement with a group linked to George Soros' foundation - primarily funded by USAID - to support a voter turnout campaign. Mr Qureshi dismissed the allegation as ""malicious"", stating that the agreement explicitly imposed ""no financial or legal obligation on either side"". On Friday, the Indian Express newspaper said in an investigative report that the $21m was sanctioned for Bangladesh and not India. It was meant to run for three years until July 2025 and that $13.4m had already been spent, according to records accessed by the newspaper."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crknd1e86x4o,Man disguised as lawyer kills gang leader in court,2025-02-21T05:48:08.807Z,Koh Ewe,"A notorious gang leader has died after he was shot inside a courthouse in Sri Lanka by a gunman disguised as a lawyer, say police. Police say the gunman used a revolver which was smuggled in a hollowed-out book by a female suspect, who remains at large. Gang leader Sanjeewa Kumara Samararathne had been escorted to court to face proceedings when he was shot. Police say he was a suspect in multiple murder cases. The shooting in the capital Colombo is among a series of killings by rivalling gangs, which has persisted as authorities vow to crack down on gang violence in the country. The gang leader, popularly known as Ganemulle Sanjeewa, had been in custody since he was arrested in September 2023. Police said he had been escorted to the courthouse on Wednesday by a dozen police officers. He was taken to hospital after he was shot but was pronounced dead on arrival. The gunman managed to flee the scene but was later captured by police. He has been identified differently by authorities and local media, but police say that he used several names. Police have identified the female suspect as 25-year-old Pinpura Dewage Ishara Sewwandi. Authorities have put out a notice promising a reward for anyone providing information on the woman. Police say they have also arrested a policeman and van driver suspected of helping the two suspects in the shooting. Lawmakers discussed reining in gang violence in parliament on Wednesday, with an opposition MP calling it a ""major security issue"". Health and mass media minister Nalinda Jayatissa, who in December had pledged to crack down on such criminal activity, said on Wednesday that the government would ""take the actions of organised underworld gangs seriously."" The incident has also raised questions about security in the courthouse, with authorities currently reviewing security measures. New security protocols are being implemented in the wake of the shooting, including deploying armed guards when certain people are brought to court. Armed security personnel are not typically allowed in court, justice minister Harshana Nanayakkara said on Thursday. At least nine people have died this year in a spate of shootings blamed on gang rivalry, according to AFP citing police data."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y4973d0e0o,Hong Kong's main opposition party announces plan to dissolve,2025-02-21T04:32:14.071Z,Martin Yip Tessa Wong,"The leaders of Hong Kong's Democratic Party have announced plans to dissolve what was once the city's largest opposition group. Members will soon vote on the final decision on whether to shut down the 31-year-old party, chairman Lo Kin-hei said. The party has been struggling to survive following moves by China to crack down on dissent in the city in the wake of the 2019 protests. Beijing and Hong Kong's government have argued that such moves were necessary for national security. As part of the crackdown, Beijing overhauled the former British colony's polling systems. The so-called ""patriots law"" was passed in Hong Kong in 2021 that ensured only people regarded as loyal to the Communist regime in Beijing could serve as lawmakers or local councillors in the semi-autonomous territory. This law effectively barred the Democratic Party from taking part in elections. At a late-night press conference on Tuesday after a party meeting, Mr Lo said the party's leaders had made the call to wind down based on the ""current political situation"". ""Developing democracy in Hong Kong is always difficult, and it's especially difficult in the past few years,"" Mr Lo said to reporters. He did not comment when asked if the party's leaders' decision had been made under political pressure. The party has set up a work group for the shutdown process. At least 75% of its members attending an upcoming general meeting will have to approve the move before it is final. A date for that meeting is yet to be set. On Wednesday, Hong Kong government adviser Regina Ip accused the Democratic Party of pursuing an agenda that opposed China and ""constantly causing trouble inside and outside parliament"". ""Therefore I am not surprised at all that they have been losing supporters in recent years... the Democratic Party has already reached a dead end,"" said Ms Ip, co-convener of Hong Kong's cabinet-like Executive Council. The Democratic Party was notable for having rare direct negotiations with the Liaison Office - the Chinese Communist government's representation in Hong Kong - in 2010, to discuss plans for more liberal elections. Its younger members, however, saw those negotiations as a betrayal. The move triggered a split while the party lost support. It subsequently regained strength and became the most successful opposition political force in the city after acquiring the most seats in the 2019 local council elections, which took place during the violent anti-government protests. A number of the Democratic Party's members - including prominent pro-democracy figures Helena Wong, Lam Cheuk-ting, Wu Chi-wai and Albert Ho - are among the Hong Kong 47 group of campaigners jailed under the controversial national security law. Another member, former legislator Ted Hui, is now living in Australia in exile and is wanted by the Hong Kong government for alleged national security offences. Earlier this week a court issued an order to confiscate his assets and money in Hong Kong, which are held by his family and a law firm. In December, Hong Kong stripped the honorary Justice of the Peace title from Martin Lee KC, a key founder of the Democratic Party, after the veteran barrister lost his appeal against an unauthorised assembly conviction."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0nzel19v1o,Six elephants dead after being hit by train in Sri Lanka,2025-02-20T07:46:01.976Z,Koh Ewe,"A passenger train derailed after striking a herd of elephants near a wildlife reserve in central Sri Lanka in the early hours of Thursday. While no injuries were reported among passengers, six elephants died from the accident in Habarana, east of the capital Colombo. Two injured elephants were being treated, police said, noting that it was the worst such wildlife accident the country had seen, AFP reported. It is not uncommon for trains to run into herds of elephants in Sri Lanka, where casualties on both sides of human-elephant encounters are among the highest in the world. Last year, more than 170 people and nearly 500 elephants were killed in human-elephant encounters overall - and around 20 elephants are killed by trains annually, according to local media. Elephants, whose natural habitats are affected by deforestation and shrinking resources, have increasingly strayed into places of human activity. Some have urged train drivers to slow down and sound the train horns to warn animals ahead on railway tracks. In 2018, a pregnant elephant and its two calves similarly died in Habarana after being struck by a train. The three had been part of a larger herd crossing the train tracks at dawn. Last October, another train ran into a herd in Minneriya, about 25km (15 miles) away from Habarana, killing two elephants and injuring one. There are an estimated 7,000 wild elephants in Sri Lanka, where the animals, revered by its Buddhist majority, are protected by law. Killing an elephant is a crime punishable by imprisonment or a fine."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpq2zd2ep8ro,Search for missing India miners ends as bodies recovered after 44 days,2025-02-20T07:24:42.424Z,"Nikhil Inamdar, BBC News, Delhi","Rescuers have ended a 44-day search operation after they found the bodies of five men who were trapped inside a flooded coal mine in India's north-eastern state of Assam. DNA tests will be conducted to identify the men as the bodies are in a decomposed state, a state official told the BBC. On 6 January, nine miners were trapped after water flooded the so-called ""rat-hole"" mine, which is a narrow hole dug manually to extract coal. Four bodies were recovered within the first week, and search operations had continued until Wednesday, when the remaining bodies were found. ""The process to identify the remains has been initiated,"" Assam Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma said on the social media platform X. The families of the miners have also been called to identify the bodies. They will be given compensation by the state government, said Riki Phukan, an official from Assam's District Disaster Management Authority. The search operations - at the Umrangso coal mine in Assam's Dima Hasao district - were jointly conducted by special disaster forces alongside the Indian Army, the Indian Navy, the state police and the district disaster authority. Divers and helicopters were also deployed but the remote, hilly terrain of the mine had posed severe challenges. Earlier, one of the men rescued from the mine had shared with the BBC a harrowing account of the moments after the tunnel was suddenly engulfed by water. Ravi Rai, a worker from Nepal, said that he was working inside the mine when water entered the pit. ""We were holding on to a rope in 50-60ft (15-18m) deep water for at least 50 minutes before being pulled out,"" he said. Despite a ban on ""rat-hole"" mining in India since 2014, small illegal mines continue to be operational in Assam and other north-eastern states. Six workers were killed in January 2024 after a fire broke out in a rat-hole coal mine in Nagaland state. In 2018, at least 15 men were trapped in an illegal mine in Meghalaya after water from a nearby river flooded it. After the recent accident, police in Assam have said they are investigating illegal mining activities in the state."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgl026rw7xpo,'Captain America must die in China': Nationalism fuels Ne Zha 2 fans,2025-02-20T04:45:06.361Z,Koh Ewe,"A chorus of praise is being sung around Ne Zha 2, the Chinese film about a mythical boy who battles demons, which has been newly crowned the world's highest-grossing animated film. The box office triumph of the film - which has raked in 12.3bn yuan ($1.7bn; £1.4bn) - triggered a huge swell of national pride across the country. But as patriotic Ne Zha 2 fans set their sights on further success, they are also keeping a close eye on critics of the movie, accusing them of being clout-chasing, paid ""haters"". Also in the crosshairs of this nationalism is Captain America: Brave New World, the fourth movie of the superhero franchise, now seen as Ne Zha 2's rival. ""I don't care if Ne Zha 2 can survive overseas, but Captain America 4 must die in China,"" reads a popular slogan that has been repeated on multiple posts on social media. In Chinese news outlets and social media, people are gloating over the lacklustre performance of the American blockbuster at China's box office. Of the $92m the film has made outside the US, only $10.6m has come from China, Hollywood's largest overseas market. ""It's not Captain America that's dying, but America that's dying,"" reads the title of an essay on an online forum analysing the movie's lack of appeal in China. The author goes on to argue: ""In reality, the US does not have superheroes and the US is not a peace-loving, peace-defending beacon for humanity."" One cinema in Sichuan province reportedly decided to hold off screenings of Captain America 4 in its theatres ""in order to support Ne Zha 2"". Meanwhile, some are critical that Ne Zha 2, which premiered outside China this month, did not get enough screenings in North American cinemas. They have also accused American cinemas of showing other movies rather than the Chinese film. Ne Zha 2 hit the screens in China on 29 January, among a string of high-profile movies designed to capture an annual surge of cinemagoers during the Lunar New Year holiday. It quickly towered over the competition, crossing the $1bn milestone in less than two weeks - even more impressive considering China's sluggish economy. Ne Zha 2 is being hailed as a symbol of progress in Chinese film and a sign that domestic productions can rival Hollywood blockbusters at the box office. Previous domestic box office hits have tended to be patriotic, action films such as The Battle of Lake Changjin, a 2021 propaganda film about the 1950s Korean War, which held the record for China's highest-grossing film until Ne Zha 2 broke it. While Hollywood films usually see their revenues spread across different regions, more than 99% of Ne Zha 2's box office earnings are coming from China - where the animation has become a litmus test for patriotism. On social media, people say they have bought tickets to watch Ne Zha 2 multiple times. And those who have not watched the movie say they have to deal with snide remarks. ""A friend told me I was not patriotic, just because I did not watch Ne Zha 2,"" a social media user posted on Douyin, China's TikTok. As cinemagoers took to social media to share their reviews of the movie, criticisms - from the lack of plot continuity to its awkward humour and anti-feminist undertones - were met with a barrage of dismissive comments. ""People like that are either clout-chasing, or are being paid,"" read one comment on Xiaohongshu, China's Instagram-like app. Insults of this nature are not new, a Chinese social media user who has posted criticisms of Ne Zha 2 and experienced such backlash first-hand, tells the BBC. But the defensiveness surrounding the film is more pronounced because of its meteoric success, which has turned it into a proxy for the Chinese film industry. In the eyes of these fans, who only see things in black and white, to criticise the movie is to side with Hollywood, they say. ""Everyone beware, there's currently a wave of haters swarming Ne Zha 2 with criticism online,"" another Xiaohongshu user commented, adding that the ""premeditated"" criticisms came from jealous individuals in either foreign or domestic film industries. ""With such a great movie, people are using their feet to vote. So they are turning to panic and slander. How despicable!"" they wrote. Ne Zha 2's huge success is helping introduce characters from Chinese mythology to new audiences around the world, and it's been praised for its script, special effects and the quality of animation. But the fact it has become a focal point for nationalist sentiment has led to some in China raising concerns about the growing political significance the film has taken on. ""Ne Zha 2 has become a cultural phenomenon, but I don't think this is entirely a good thing,"" reads a Xiaohongshu post reflecting on the sharpening debate over the movie. ""Criticising the plot flaws is equated to being unpatriotic; unreservedly condemning other films released in the same period; replacing deep discussion with a war between fans and haters ... This is definitely not a good cultural environment."""

The two British men were hiking in ""extremely difficult terrain"" near the village of Thathri in Dharamshala when one of them was critically injured, local emergency services said. The man was rescued and taken down the mountain on a stretcher, but by the time he reached hospital nearly 24 hours later he was declared dead, rescuers said. The Foreign Office said they were ""supporting the family of a British man who has died in India and are in contact with the local authorities"". According to the Times of India, the pair were hiking the Triund trek, a popular route of about 7km (4.3 miles) in the foothills of the Dhauladhar mountain range. They were on their descent when one of the men fell and his friend sought help from the nearby village, the newspaper reports. Local rescuers, the Himachal Pradesh State Disaster Response Force, said on X that the call for their help had come in at 18:00 on Sunday, and a team of 10 people had been sent up the mountain to search for the men. ""After four hours of trekking, the team located the victims at 10:30pm with one trekker in a critical condition. They secured the critical trekker onto a stretcher and began the challenging descent along with his co trekker. ""The rough terrain and repeated crossings of a rivulet made progress extremely slow, requiring nearly two hours to cover just 100m."" Overnight the team requested backup, and more rescuers arrived in the morning. ""They continued transporting the victims but faced extreme difficulty due to the steep landscape, requiring multiple anchorings of the stretcher."" The man was finally taken to hospital at 17:08 on Monday but was declared dead on arrival, rescuers added. His friend was unharmed. The local authorities in Kangra district had brought in a temporary ban on trekking in high-altitude areas, but the Times of India says the two tourists were unaware of it. It said they had reached the snowline - the part of the mountain where snow is on the ground all year round. The victim has yet to be formally identified."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1lv3g51n9yo,'We will unite with Kim Jong Un': Conspiracies grip South Korea,2025-02-19T23:08:57.009Z,Jean Mackenzie,"On a cold January afternoon, a young pharmacy student, Shin Jeong-min, waited restlessly outside South Korea's Constitutional Court, as the country's suspended president arrived to fight his impeachment. While Yoon Suk Yeol testified, she chanted along with hundreds of his incensed and worried supporters, who have rallied around him ever since his failed attempt to impose martial law. ""Release him now. Cancel his impeachment,"" they shouted. ""If the president is impeached and the opposition leader is elected, our country will become one with North Korea and Kim Jong Un,"" Jeong-min said, citing a theory popular among President Yoon's most fanatical followers: that the left-leaning opposition party wants to unify with the North and turn South Korea into a communist country. At 22 years old, Jeong-min stands out from the legion of elderly Koreans who have always feared and despised the North, and make up the bulk of those who hold these far-right conspiratorial beliefs. That generation of Koreans, now in its 60s and 70s, lived through the Cold War and remembers bitterly the devastating aftermath of North Korea's invasion in the 1950s. When Yoon declared martial law in early December, he played on these fears to justify his power grab. Without citing evidence, he claimed that ""North Korean communist forces"" had infiltrated the opposition party and were trying to overthrow the country. They needed to be ""eradicated"", he said, as he moved swiftly to ban political activity and put the army in charge. Two months on from his failed coup, an anti-communist frenzy is gripping Yoon's supporters, young and old. Even some who had never given North Korea or communism much thought are now convinced their dynamic democracy is on the brink of being turned into a leftist dictatorship – and that their leader had no choice but to remove people's democratic rights in order to protect them from both Pyongyang and Beijing. ""This a war between communism and democracy,"" said one office worker in his 40s, who had slipped out of work to join the protest at the court. Another man, in his 30s, adamantly argued the president had to be returned to office as soon as possible. ""He's going to arrest all the North Korean spies,"" he said. Such threats were once very real. During the 1960s and 70s, spies would regularly attempt to infiltrate the government. In 1968, a group of North Korean commandos crawled across the border and tried to assassinate then President Park Chung-hee. A tree atop Seoul's Bugak mountain still bears the bullet marks from the intense gun battles that raged for nearly two weeks. In the 1980s, during the final years of South Korea's violent military dictatorship, a radical far-left student movement began to praise Pyongyang for its ""superior"" political system. They were labelled regime ""sympathisers"". It was also common for authoritarian leaders to accuse their political adversaries of being North Korean conspirators. ""Anti-communism became the dominant ideology of South Korea's military dictators, who used it to control society and justify restricting people's freedom,"" said Shin Jin-wook, a sociology professor at Chungang University. Today, these threats have dissipated. Pyongyang's nuclear weapons and advanced cyber-hacking abilities pose the greater risk, and you would struggle to find anyone in South Korea who wants to emulate life in the North. The political left and right are merely divided over how to deal with their troublesome neighbour. While the approach of Yoon's conservative People Power Party has been to try to threaten the North into submission with military superiority, the left-leaning Democratic Party prefers to engage with Pyongyang, believing the two countries can peacefully co-exist. The president has been accused of exploiting people's historic fears. ""Yoon's rhetoric almost completely matches that of past dictators, and he is the first president to use this anti-communist ideology so blatantly since Korea became a democracy in 1987,"" said Mr Shin. Not only has Yoon accused the parliament, led by the opposition Democratic Party, of being riddled with Pyongyang sympathisers, but he has dangled the idea that North Korea, with help from China, rigged last year's parliamentary election. ""This is fake news cooked up by Yoon to demonise the opposition and justify his completely undemocratic move,"" one Democratic Party lawmaker, Wi Sung-lac, told the BBC. ""We have a long history of fighting for democracy and freedom in Korea. We are the ones who managed to thwart Yoon's attempt to destroy Korea's democracy,"" he said, referring to the opposition politicians who pushed past troops and climbed over the parliament's walls during martial law to vote down the motion. Such ideas were previously pedalled by extreme conservative groups, said Lee Sangsin, a polling expert at the Korea Institute for National Unification. ""These groups were isolated. People didn't take much notice,"" he explained. ""But because Yoon is the president, his words carry weight, and many people have accepted what he said."" This was evident at one of the pro-Yoon weekend rallies we attended last month. Far from being die-hard conspiracy theorists, nearly everyone we spoke to said Yoon had changed their thinking. ""At first I didn't support Yoon, but martial law opened my eyes,"" said Oh Jung-hyuk, a 57-year-old musician, there with his wife. ""We can see how deeply embedded leftist forces are in our society."" One woman in her 40s told us she previously had doubts about Chinese vote rigging but had researched the issue after martial law and ""realised it was true"". Yoon's supporters often point to real events – how the previous Democratic Party President, Moon Jae-in, met Kim Jong Un to try to orchestrate a peace deal; that the current Democratic leader, Lee Jae-myung, is being investigated for helping to send millions of dollars to North Korea - then use these as evidence of a greater plot. ""This far-fetched conspiracy theory that China rigged the election is becoming more and more accepted,"" said the sociology professor Mr Shin. ""One of the most basic consensuses in a democracy is the premise of fair and free elections, and now we have people distrusting that. This is very extreme."" As Yoon's unsubstantiated claims have taken root, his support seems to have grown. Although the majority of people in South Korea still want him permanently removed from office, the number has fallen. Last week it stood at 57%, compared to 75% in the week after the martial law declaration. Through his anti-communist rhetoric, Yoon has also effectively tapped into a simmering distrust of China. To fear North Korea now means to be wary of China too. At a recent weekend rally in Seoul, many supporters had swapped their trademark ""Stop the Steal"" election fraud placards for ones that read ""Chinese Communist Party OUT"". ""I believe China is interfering in all South Korea's political affairs. It's pulling the strings behind the scenes,"" said 66-year-old Jo Yeon-deok, who was holding one of the signs. According to the polling expert, Mr Lee, ""a growing portion of the public now believes China wants to turn South Korea into some kind of vassal state"". For those in their 20s and 30s who have never experienced real danger from North Korea, China is a more believable threat. Last year the Pew Research Centre found that South Korea and Hungary were the only two countries where the young had a more negative view of China than the old. But contrary to the information they are being fed, young people's fears have nothing to do with communism, said Cho Jin-man, a political scientist at Duksung Women's University. Until recently South Koreans felt their country was superior to China, Mr Cho explained - but as Beijing has become stronger and more assertive they have started to see it as a threat, especially since the US started treating it as such. On top of that, young people have a lot of grievances: they're struggling to find work or afford a home, and feel resentful when they see their universities catering to Chinese students. Communism, Mr Cho believes, is being used as a convenient catch-all bogeyman to stir up fear and hate. This message is amplified by far-right YouTube channels, particularly popular with young men. ""North Korea and China are my biggest concerns,"" said Kim Gyung-joo, a 30-year-old IT developer, who came alone to one of the rallies. He used to be left-wing like his friends, he said, and was initially very critical of the president's martial law order. But after researching the issue on YouTube he realised martial law was ""unavoidable"". ""If I'd been in the president's position, I'd have declared it too,"" he said. Nonetheless, Wi Sung-lac the opposition politician is not concerned about his party losing support. ""Even though these extreme views are spreading, they will be limited,"" he said. ""Most people understand who we really are, and they are yearning for a return to normality."" Polling expert Lee Sang-sin is less sanguine, likening Yoon's supporters to ""a fast-growing cult"". The president's move was ""very divisive"", he said. ""It is going to have a lasting effect on Korean society"". Additional reporting by Hosu Lee and Leehyun Choi"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4g8q51xdo,YouTuber's 'dirty' comments spark massive row in India,2025-02-19T22:50:11.468Z,Cherylann Mollan,"""Dirty."" ""Perverted mind."" ""Disgusting."" These were the words India's Supreme Court used on Tuesday while granting interim protection from arrest to a popular YouTuber who has been in the eye of a storm in the country over the past week. The furore began after Ranveer Allahbadia - whose YouTube channel BeerBiceps has eight million followers - asked a contestant the question: ""Would you rather watch your parents have sex every day for the rest of your life or join in once and stop it forever?"" The comments, made on the show India's Got Latent on 9 February, sparked massive outrage, police cases and even death threats. YouTube quickly removed the episode, but that didn't stall the tide of anger directed at Allahbadia and the show. In fact, the amount of attention the incident has received is mind-boggling: it has made national headlines, been covered on primetime TV and some of India's most prominent news sites have even run live pages. Not surprising, considering the star status of Allahbadia. He has interviewed federal ministers, top Bollywood celebrities, cricketers and Hollywood actors. And last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi handed him a ""National Creators Awards"" trophy. Since the controversy erupted, Allahbadia and the show's creator, Samay Raina, have apologised for the comments and Raina has taken down all previous episodes of the show. The Supreme Court in its recent order has even banned Allahbadia from posting content on social media. But the incident continues to make news. ""It feels like the state is trying to make an example out of Allahbadia,"" says Apar Gupta, founder of the Internet Freedom Foundation. Saket Gokhale, an opposition lawmaker, also condemned the targeting of Allahbadia and the show. ""Crass content can be criticised if it offends you. However, you cannot have the state persecute and lock up people for offending your 'moral sentiments',"" he wrote in a post on X. Popular comedian Vir Das also weighed in on the controversy and criticised news channels for their one-dimensional coverage of the incident and for taking a disparaging view of all digital content. Allahbadia's remarks and the subsequent backlash have triggered debates around free speech and India's obscenity laws; it has also sparked conversations around the thirst for viral content and the consequences its makers face when their content crosses lines upheld by the very people who watch it. Raina's show, which debuted in June, has been popular from the start, with each episode being viewed tens of millions of times on YouTube. And it hasn't shied away from kickstarting controversies either. The show has platformed some bizarre performances and judges and contestants have been seen making crass and crude comments more than a few times. Critics have accused the show of spewing misogynistic views and for body-shaming guests. A popular fashion influencer once walked out of the show after a male contestant compared her to a former adult film actress while another asked her about her ""body count"" (a slang term for the number of sexual partners a person has had). But that seems to have been the appeal of the show too. Fans of the show have hailed it for championing ""raw talent and unfiltered jokes"". Some have said that they liked the roasts - a form of insult comedy - which was popular on the show. Experts have underscored how, with the entertainment landscape exploding, digital content creators often feel compelled to push the envelope - even if it means resorting to the risqué and lewd - just to gain views and virality. It's safe to say the show pushed the envelope and the buttons of many. But then, it backfired. ""A lot of comedy, especially of a certain masculine kind, is cruel and punches down on people. It has a violent undercurrent. So if you contribute to that culture, it's not a shock if it comes back to bite you some day,"" filmmaker Paromita Vohra says. She adds that successful comedy calls for a fine-tuned awareness of the audience it is being performed for and what boundaries it can push. Interestingly, Allahbadia's question, which sparked the furore, was almost identical to the question asked by the host of an Australian comedy show called OG Crew's Truth or Drink. While the question didn't spark outrage in Australia, it has in India. ""The internet has made it possible for content to reach spaces and people it was not organically playing to. Unthinkingly appropriating content can have unexpected consequences,"" she says. But she also says that there's a need to guard against making such issues a question of morality. ""When such controversies erupt, there is always the risk of morality being weaponised to punish people who have gone against what's accepted by society,"" she says and adds that morality is increasingly being beaten into the legal framework of the country, which can have a divisive effect. Some critics have also accused the authorities of using the controversy as a smoke screen to divert attention from other pressing problems - like unemployment and pollution. Some fear that it will be used by the federal government as a reason to justify further regulating content creation. After the controversy, a report by NDTV news channel stated that a parliamentary panel was considering making laws around digital content stricter. The Supreme Court too has pushed for more regulations around online content. Mr Gupta says the state already has a ""tremendous amount of power"" to prosecute people accused of flouting various data and content laws and that while the state exercises its powers without restraint, content creators don't have as many legal safeguards to protect them. ""Instead of tighter laws, we need more reform; existing legal standards need to be more tolerant of free expression,"" he says. ""Other systems, like education and digital learning should be strengthened so that young people know to get their education from the classroom, and turn to the internet only for entertainment."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yxl8lrlnxo,"No faecal bacteria in Kumbh Mela river waters, says minister",2025-02-19T13:08:18.631Z,Cherylann Mollan,"The chief minister of India's Uttar Pradesh state has rejected a government report that found high levels of contamination in a key bathing place at the Kumbh Mela, the world's largest gathering. The report said the waters at Sangam - the confluence of rivers considered holy by Hindus - in Prayagraj city had alarming levels of untreated sewage and bacteria found in human and animal excreta, making it unfit for bathing. On Wednesday, Chief Minister Yogi Adityanath insisted that the water was not just fit for bathing, but also safe for doing aachman - the Hindu ritual of drinking a handful after bathing. Authorities say 565 million have bathed since the festival began on 13 January. The Kumbh Mela (also known as Mahakumbh) - is held once every 12 years. Hindus believe that taking a dip at Sangam - the confluence of India's most sacred Ganges river with the Yamuna river and the mythical Saraswati - will cleanse them of sins, purify their soul and help them attain salvation. The Mela, which stretches over six weeks, draws devotees from all walks of life and from all around the world. Tens of millions have been bathing in the rivers daily during the festival, which will end on 26 February. However, health activists and environmentalists have expressed concern over the water quality of the rivers during the festival. Before the Mela began, India's top environment court had directed the pollution control boards of the federal and state governments to monitor the water in the rivers regularly and to take adequate steps to maintain its quality. But a report submitted by the federal government's Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB) earlier this month stated that the waters of the Ganges and Yamuna had high coliform levels. Coliform level is a key indicator of the presence of untreated sewage and faecal bacteria in water. The report said that the coliform levels in the Ganges were 1,400 times more than the acceptable limit, and in the Yamuna river, they were 660 times more. The CPCB analysed water samples from both the rivers on five separate days in January, but the coliform levels never met standards, the report added. Chief Minister Adityanath, however, insisted that his government was continuously monitoring water in the rivers to maintain its quality. ""All the pipes and the drains in and around Sangam have been taped and the water is being released only after purification,"" he said. ""The reasons for increased faecal coliform can be several, such as sewage leakage and animal waste, but the amount of faecal coliform in Prayagraj is as per the standards,"" he added. He accused the opposition of running a ""false campaign"" to defame the Kumbh Mela. This is not the first time that the Uttar Pradesh government has come under scrutiny for the way it has organised and is managing the Kumbh Mela. On one of the most auspicious bathing days in January, at least 30 people died in a crush that took place near the Sangam. On Sunday, another crush at the New Delhi Railway Station - where thousands of devotees had gathered to board trains for Prayagraj - killed around 18 people."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86pl55x0qno,'Real life Squid Game': Kim Sae-ron's death exposes Korea's celebrity culture,2025-02-19T10:18:14.003Z,Kelly Ng,"Actress Kim Sae-ron's death in an apparent suicide has renewed criticism of South Korea's entertainment industry, which churns out stars but also subjects them to immense pressure and scrutiny. Kim - who was found dead aged 24 at her home in Seoul on Sunday - had been bombarded with negative press coverage and hate online after a drink-driving conviction in 2022. Police have not provided further details about her death. Experts found the circumstances leading to it depressingly familiar. Other celebrities also ended up taking their lives after careers upended by cyberbullying. As Kim was laid to rest on Wednesday, analysts say they are not optimistic her death will lead to meaningful change. South Korea's entertainment industry is enjoying massive popularity. Today, there are more than an estimated 220 million fans of Korean entertainment around the world – that's four times the population of South Korea. But there is also increasing spotlight on the less glamorous side of the entertainment industry. South Korea is known for its hyper-competitive culture in most spheres of life - from education to careers. It has one of the highest suicide rates among developed countries. While its overall suicide rate is falling, deaths of those in their 20s are rising. This pressure is heightened in the case of celebrities. They face immense pressure to be perfect, and are subjected to the demands of obsessive ""super fans"" who can make or break careers. That is why even the slightest perceived misstep can be career ending. Kim Sae-ron became so unpopular, scenes featuring her were edited out of shows such as Netflix's 2023 drama Bloodhounds. ""It is not enough that the celebrities be punished by the law. They become targets of relentless criticism,"" Korean culture critic Kim Hern-sik told the BBC. He referred to K-pop artists Sulli and Goo Hara, who died by suicide in 2019 after long battles with internet trolls, even though they did not have known brushes with the law. Sulli had offended fans for not conforming to the K-pop mould, while an internet mob had targeted Goo Hara over her relationship with an ex-boyfriend.   Cyberbullying has also become a money-making gig for some, Kim Hern-sik told the BBC. ""YouTubers get the views, forums get the engagement, news outlets get the traffic. I don't think [Kim's death] will change the situation. ""There needs to be harsher criminal punishment against leaving nasty comments,"" he says. Kim Sae-ron's father has blamed a YouTuber for her death, claiming the controversial videos they published caused her deep emotional distress. Others have pointed fingers at some local media outlets, who reportedly fuelled public animosity against Kim by reporting the unverified claims. ""This cycle of media-driven character assassination must stop,"" civic group Citizens' Coalition for Democratic Media said in a statement on Tuesday. Na Jong-ho, a psychiatry professor at Yale University, likened the spate of celebrity deaths in South Korea to a real-life version of Squid Game, the South Korean Netflix blockbuster which sees the indebted fighting to the death for a huge cash prize. ""Our society abandons those who stumble and moves on as if nothing happened.. How many more lives must be lost before we stop inflicting this destructive, suffocating shame on people?"" he wrote on Facebook. ""Drunk driving is a big mistake. There would be a problem with our legal system if that goes unpunished. However, a society that buries people who make mistakes without giving them a second chance is not a healthy one,"" Prof Na added. Last year, the BBC reported on how ""super fans"" in the notorious K-pop industry try to dictate their idols' private lives - from their romantic relationships to their daily activities outside of work - and can be unforgiving when things go off script. It is no surprise that Kim Sae-ron chose to withdraw from the public eye after her DUI conviction, for which she was fined 20 million won (£11,000) in April 2023.  It is worth noting however, that not all public figures are subject to the same treatment. Politicians, including opposition leader Lee Jae-myung, also have past drink-driving convictions but have been able to bounce back - polls show Lee is now the country's top presidential contender. In South Korea, it is ""extremely tough"" for artistes to recover when they do something that puts a crack in their ""idol"" image, says K-pop columnist Jeff Benjamin. He contrasts this to entertainment industries in the West, where controversies and scandals sometimes even ""add a rockstar-like edge"" to celebrities' reputations. ""While no one cheers when a Hollywood celebrity is arrested for DUI [driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs] or sent to jail for significant crimes, it's not necessarily career-ending,"" he says. While the Korean entertainment industry has made moves to address performers' mental health concerns, it is unclear how effective these have been. Real change can only happen when there is no more financial or attention incentives to continue with such intrusive reporting, says Mr Benjamin.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgdr4r2l31o,Philippine town offers bounty for mosquitoes as dengue rises,2025-02-19T10:08:41.983Z,Virma Simonette & Joel Guinto,"Authorities in one of the Philippines' most densely-populated urban centres are offering a cash reward for mosquitoes in an attempt to stop the spread of dengue. Carlito Cernal, village chief of Barangay Addition Hills in central Manila, announced the bounty of one peso (less than two US cents) for every five mosquitoes. While news of the bounty has provoked scorn on social media, Mr Cernal has defended it as necessary for the community's health. The move follows a recent spike in cases of dengue, which is spread by mosquitoes, in the Philippines. The programme, which will run for at least a month, was started after two students in Mr Cernal's neighbourhood died from the disease. The bounty applies to all mosquitoes - dead or alive - and their larvae, Mr Cernal added. Live mosquitoes will be exterminated using ultraviolet light. A total of 21 people have already claimed their reward, bringing in a total of 700 mosquitoes and larvae so far, he told the BBC. The bounty drew swift ridicule after it was announced late on Tuesday. ""Mosquito farming is coming,"" one social media comment read. ""Will a mosquito get rejected if it has only one wing?"" read another. The Philippines' Department of Health (DOH) told the BBC that it ""appreciates the good intentions of local government executives to fight dengue"". It declined further comment, however, when asked if catching mosquitoes in exchange for cash is an effective way of stopping dengue. ""We urge all concerned to please consult and coordinate with their local health officers or the DOH regional office in their area for evidence-based practices that are known to work,"" it said. Mr Cernal said he was aware that the bounty had been bashed on social media, but added: ""This is one of the biggest and most dense areas. We have to do something to help the local government."" He pointed out that local health authorities recorded 44 cases of dengue in the community during the most recent surge of infections. Barangay Addition Hills is home to nearly 70,000 people, crammed into a 162-hectare patch at the heart of the capital, Metro Manila. Mr Cernal said the bounty was meant to supplement existing measures such as cleaning the streets and preventing the build-up of water where dengue-carrying mosquitoes lay their eggs. Dengue is endemic in tropical countries, and outbreaks often occur in urban areas with poor sanitation which allows virus-carrying mosquitoes to multiply. In severe cases, dengue causes internal bleeding which can lead to death. Its symptoms include headaches, nausea, joint and muscle pain. Philippine authorities have recently flagged a rise in dengue cases nationwide due to seasonal rains. The DOH said it recorded 28,234 cases on 1 February, a 40% jump from the previous year. The department has advised the public to maintain the cleanliness of their surroundings, destroy potential mosquito breeding sites such as tyres, wear long-sleeved shirts and trousers and apply mosquito repellent. Aside from dengue, the DOH said the rains have also fuelled a spike in influenza-like diseases and cases of leptospirosis, a rat-borne disease that people get when wading in flood waters."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdrxlnpeyx5o,Man jailed for attempted murder of former Japan PM,2025-02-19T07:06:46.861Z,Shaimaa Khalil Gavin Butler,"A man has been sentenced to 10 years in prison for the attempted murder of Japan's former prime minister Fumio Kishida in 2023. Ryuji Kimura, 25, hurled a pipe bomb at Kishida as the country's leader approached a crowd for a speech during an election event in the city of Wakayama. Although Kishida was unharmed, the explosion of the homemade device caused minor injuries to a police officer and a member of the public. The attack shocked Japan as it came less than a year after former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was shot dead at an outdoor election campaign event. Kimura, who was sentenced on Wednesday, claimed during questioning his intention was not to kill Kishida, but to object to the country's election age regulation which prevented him from getting into politics. The minimum age to become a member of parliament in Japan is 25 for the House of Representatives and 30 for the House of Councillors. Kimura further added that he threw the bomb to bring attention to a civil lawsuit he filed in 2022, claiming the age restriction was unconstitutional, which was dismissed. Kimura's defence argued he should not face a charge of attempted murder, as he did not expect the bomb to cause injuries, and that a three-year prison sentence would be reasonable given the extent of those injuries. The court stated, however, that the explosives were powerful enough to cause fatal damage. When handing down the ruling, presiding judge Keiko Fukushima noted that ""targeting a serving prime minister caused significant anxiety to society as a whole."" In addition to the attempted murder charge, Kimura was also found guilty of violating explosives regulations and firearms control laws. His 10-year sentence is five years less than what prosecutors had sought. While violent attacks are extremely rare in Japan, anxiety around politicians' security has surged in the wake of Abe's assassination in 2022. The attempted attack on Kishida, which came less than a year later, raised questions as to why there was not a tighter security presence around the country's leader at that time."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxnwnye7wko,"Facing Islamist threats, Bangladesh girls forced to cancel football matches",2025-02-18T22:16:24.744Z,Anbarasan Ethirajan,"Asha Roy, 17, was excited to take part in a women's football tournament, but her hopes were dashed as Islamists forced the organisers to cancel the match in northern Bangladesh. Shortly before the game began earlier this month, the Islami Andolan Bangladesh group announced a protest rally against the event in Rangpur region, saying it was un-Islamic. Fearing trouble, local police stepped in and the women's team members were asked to return to their home for their safety. ""I was frustrated and frightened. We had never faced such a situation before. It was disappointing that we came back without playing,"" Ms Roy told the BBC. Bangladesh, a Muslim-majority nation, is currently undergoing a political transition after widespread protests ousted its authoritarian government last year. An interim administration is currently in charge but there are concerns that Islamist groups, which had been pushed to the fringes, have become emboldened again. The women's football match was the third to be cancelled in northern Bangladesh in less than two weeks due to the objections of religious hardliners. In the Dinajpur area, roughly 70km (43 miles) west of Rangpur, Islamists protesting against a game clashed with locals who supported it, leaving four people injured. For girls such as Asha Roy, who come from rural areas, football and other sports are a source of female empowerment and a way out of poverty. Those who shine can be selected to play for sponsored teams and some go on to represent Bangladesh internationally. Many girls have been inspired to take up football thanks to the success of the national women's team, who are considered heroes after winning two consecutive South Asia Football Championships in recent years. Ms Roy's teammate, Musammat Tara Moni, said she would not stop playing despite the threats. ""It's my dream to represent our national team. My family supports me, so I am not losing hope,"" the 16-year-old said. For their coach Nurul Islam, the objections came as a surprise. ""I have taken the team to many tournaments for the past seven years, but it's the first time we have faced a situation like this,"" he said. The Islamists insist that the match they stopped was against their religious values and say that they are determined to prevent any future football games. ""If women want to play football, they should cover their entire body, and they can play only in front of female spectators. Men cannot watch them play,"" Maulana Ashraf Ali, the leader of the Islami Andolan Bangladesh in the Taraganj area of Rangpur, told the BBC. Mr Ali also insisted that the group ""definitely"" want hard-line Islamic Sharia law in Bangladesh. The cancellation of the women's football matches caused an uproar on social media, leading the authorities to reorganise one of them. They have also launched an investigation into the incidents but say the fear of radicalism is exaggerated. ""There is no truth in the allegations that the government is pandering to Islamists,"" Shafiqul Alam, press secretary to interim leader Muhammad Yunus, told the BBC. Mr Alam pointed out that hundreds of women's sports matches were held as part of a national youth festival in January, and that they were played across the country without any trouble. Some people are not reassured. Samina Luthfa, assistant professor of sociology in the University of Dhaka, told the BBC the cancellation of the women's football matches was ""definitely alarming"".  ""The women of Bangladesh will not stop playing football and will not stop from going to work or doing their things,"" she said, adding that ""everyone will fight"" efforts to remove women from public spaces.   Other decisions made by the interim government since it assumed power in August in relation to Islamist hardliners have also raised concerns. They include revoking a ban on the country's largest Islamist party, Jamaat-e-Islami, which was introduced in the last days of former prime minister Sheikh Hasina's government. Jashimuddin Rahmani, the leader of banned Islamist militant group Ansarullah Bangladesh (ABT) - now known as Ansar al Islam - was released in August after a court granted him bail. He was sentenced to five years in prison in connection with the killing of a secular blogger in 2013, but had been kept behind bars because of other pending cases. According to local media reports, several other people accused of having links with extremist groups have also been given bail in the past few months. ""Though security forces say they will monitor those released, it will be difficult for them to put everybody under surveillance given the limitations,"" says Dr Tawohidul Haque, a crime analyst from the University of Dhaka. While most Bangladeshis practise moderate Islam and secular values dominate society, Islamic extremism is not a new phenomenon in the country. A decade ago, religious zealots targeted secular bloggers, atheists, minorities, foreigners and others in a spate of attacks - killing dozens and sending others fleeing abroad. In one such incident, a group of Islamist gunmen stormed the Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka in 2016, killing 20 people. It is not just women's football games that have been targeted recently either. Last week, dozens of Islamist students vandalised a book stall at Dhaka's famous Ekushey Book Fair. The protesters were angry over the display a book by the exiled feminist author Taslima Nasrin, who has in the past received death threats from Islamist groups for what they say are her blasphemous writings. Muhammad Yunus condemned the incident saying the attack ""shows contempt for both the rights of Bangladeshi citizens and for the laws of our country."" The police are investigating. Meanwhile, one of the country's best-known actors, Pori Moni said she was stopped from inaugurating a department store in the northern town of Tangail after reported objections from religious groups. ""Now I'm really feeling helpless, as well as insecure. It's part of my job to take part in opening a showroom or a similar event. No one has stopped me all these years,"" Ms Moni told the BBC Bengali service. Similar events involving two other actors, Apu Biswas and Mehazabien Chowdhury, have also been cancelled following threats by Islamists. Minority groups like the Sufi Muslims say they are also witnessing increasing attacks on their places of worship. Islamist extremists view Sufism as heretical. ""About a hundred of our shrines [mazars] and centres have been attacked in the past six months,"" Anisur Rahman Jafri, Secretary General of the Sufism Universal Foundation, told the BBC. ""We have not seen this kind of sudden extremist attack on us since the country's independence in 1971,"" he added, warning that the country was at risk of ""Talibanisation"" if the situation continued. Police said only 40 shrines were damaged and that they had stepped up security around religious sites. The authorities have also been struggling to maintain law and order in the wake of Sheikh Hasina's departure. Earlier this month, thousands of protesters vandalised homes and buildings connected to Hasina and senior leaders of her Awami League party. People from other groups and parties, including Islamists, joined in other demonstrations in the capital, Dhaka, and across the country. The authorities have defended the security forces for not intervening, saying doing so would have cost lives. Rights groups have expressed concern over the security situation. ""If the government fails to act, then Islamists are going to feel emboldened. There will be more self-censorship for women and girls, they will be more intimidated participating in public events,"" Shireen Huq, a prominent women's rights activist, told the BBC. ""I am still optimistic that this phenomenon will not sustain,"" she added. Additional reporting from the BBC Bengali service in Dhaka"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8qglr9r74o,India seeks AI breakthrough - but is it falling behind?,2025-02-18T22:13:55.320Z,"Nikhil Inamdar, BBC News","Two years after ChatGPT took the world by storm, China's DeepSeek has sent ripples through the tech industry by collapsing the cost for developing generative artificial intelligence applications. But as the global race for AI supremacy heats up, India appears to have fallen behind, especially in creating its own foundational language model that's used to power things like chatbots. The government claims a homegrown equivalent to DeepSeek isn't far away. It is supplying startups, universities and researchers with thousands of high-end chips needed to develop it in under 10 months. A flurry of global AI leaders have also been talking up India's capabilities recently. After being initially dismissive, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman this month said India should be playing a leading role in the AI revolution. The country is now OpenAI's second largest market by users. Others like Microsoft have put serious money on the table – committing $3bn (£2.4bn) for cloud and AI infrastructure. Nvidia's Jensen Huang also spoke of India's ""unmatched"" technical talent as a key to unlocking its future potential. With 200 startups working on generative AI, there's enough entrepreneurial activity under way too. But despite having key ingredients for success in place, India risks lagging behind without basic structural fixes to education, research and state policy, experts say. China and the US already have a ""four to five year head-start"", having invested heavily in research and academia and developed AI for military applications, law enforcement and now large language models, technology analyst Prasanto Roy told the BBC. Though in the top five globally on Stanford's AI Vibrancy Index – which ranks countries on metrics such as patents, funding, policy and research – India is still far behind the two superpowers in many key areas. China and the US were granted 60% and 20% of the world's total AI patents between 2010 and 2022 respectively. India got less than half a percent. India's AI startups also received a fraction of the private investment that US and Chinese companies got in 2023. India's state-funded AI mission, meanwhile, is worth a trifling $1bn compared with the staggering $500bn the US has earmarked for Stargate - a plan to build massive AI infrastructure in the US - or China's reported $137bn initiative to become an AI hub by 2030. While DeepSeek's success has demonstrated that AI models can be built on older, less expensive chips - something India can take solace from - lack of ""patient"" or long-term capital from either industry or government is a major problem, says Jaspreet Bindra, founder of a consultancy that builds AI literacy in organisations. ""Despite what has been heard about DeepSeek developing a model with $5.6m, there was much more capital behind it."" Lack of high-quality India-specific datasets required for training AI models in regional languages such as Hindi, Marathi or Tamil is another problem, especially given India's language diversity. But for all its issues, India punches far above its weight on talent – with 15% of the world's AI workers coming from the country. The issue though, as Stanford's AI talent migration research shows, is that more and more of them are choosing to leave the country. This is partly because ""foundational AI innovations typically come from deep R&D in universities and corporate research labs"", Mr Bindra says. And India lacks a supporting research environment, with few deep-tech breakthroughs emerging from its academic and corporate sectors. The enormous success of India's payments revolution was due to strong government-industry-academia collaboration - a similar model, he says, needs to be replicated for the AI push. The Unified Payment Interface (UPI), a digital payment system developed by a government organisation, has revolutionised digital payments in India, allowing millions to transact at the click of a button or by scanning a QR code. Bengaluru's $200bn outsourcing industry, home to millions of coders, should have ideally been at the forefront of India's AI ambitions. But the IT companies have never really shifted their focus from cheap service-based work to developing foundational consumer AI technologies. ""It's a huge gap which they left to the startups to fill,"" says Mr Roy. He's unsure though whether startups and government missions can do this heavy lifting quickly enough, adding that the 10-month timeline set by the minster was a knee-jerk reaction to DeepSeek's sudden emergence. ""I don't think India will be able to produce anything like DeepSeek at least for the next few years,"" he adds. It is a view many others share. India can, however, continue to build and tweak applications upon existing open source platforms like DeepSeek ""to leapfrog our own AI progress"", Bhavish Agarwal, founder of one of India's earliest AI startups Krutrim, recently wrote on X. In the longer run though, developing a foundational model will be critical to have strategic autonomy in the sector and reduce import dependencies and threats of sanctions, say experts. India will also need to increase its computational power or hardware infrastructure to run such models, which means manufacturing semiconductors - something that's not taken off yet. Much of this will need to fall in place before the gap with the US and China is narrowed meaningfully."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yeyy3y1ejo,Japan to increase reliance on nuclear energy in post-Fukushima shift,2025-02-18T11:38:11.536Z,Shaimaa Khalil,"Japan says it will increase its reliance on nuclear energy in a major policy shift as it seeks to meet growing demand from power-hungry sectors like AI and semiconductors. An energy plan approved by the cabinet on Tuesday called for ""maximising the use of nuclear energy"" and dropped reference to ""reducing reliance on nuclear energy"". The energy plan, written by the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry says that by 2040, nuclear energy should account for 20% of Japan's grid supply in 2040, more than double the 8.5% share in 2023. It comes as the Fukushima nuclear plant disaster from 14 years ago continues to hang over the country, conjuring painful memories. In March 2011, a 9.0-magnitude earthquake near Japan's north-east coast spawned a tsunami that killed more than 18,000 people, wiping out entire towns and flooding the reactors of the Fukushima Daiichi plant. Japan now operates 14 commercial nuclear reactors, compared to 54 before the Fukushima disaster when 30% of the country's energy was from nuclear sources. The plan still needs approval by parliament, where it will be discussed in the coming months. The country, which imports 90% of its fuel, needs to look to nuclear sources as part of its plan to cut back on carbon and be self-reliant on energy, said Daishiro Yamagiwa, an MP who was part of a government advisory committee on the energy plan. ""Because of the conflict in Ukraine and the war in the Middle East, even fossil fuels have become difficult to buy,"" he told the BBC. ""Japan is a country without energy resources, so we must use whatever is available in a balanced way."" Yamagiwa added that energy burdens are growing because of demand from AI data processing centres and semiconductor factories around the country. But experts say increasing reliance on nuclear energy will be both risky and costly. Japan will need to import uranium, which is expensive and will make the country reliant on other countries, said Professor Kenichi Oshima at the faculty of policy science at Ryukoku University. Prof Oshima told the BBC the main concern is that increasing the number of nuclear power plants also raises the risk of potentially disastrous accidents. He cited the 2024 New Year's Day earthquake in the Noto peninsula, where two decades ago, a plan to build a nuclear plant was scrapped because locals opposed it. ""If there had been a nuclear power plant there, it is quite clear that it would have caused a major accident,"" he said. In Japan, any mention of nuclear energy inevitably brings back difficult memories of the nuclear meltdown at the Daiichi power plant. ""We all had such a terrible experience at the time of the Fukushima quake,"" Tokyo resident Yuko Maruyama told the BBC. ""How could I support it [the nuclear energy plan]? I want the government to rely on other sources of energy,"" she added. ""As a mother I think of the children, of their safety. I cannot help but think about what would happen in the future."" The meltdown at Fukushima is considered the world's worst since that of Chernobyl in 1986. It stirred fresh controversy in 2023, when Japan started releasing treated water from the site of the Fukushima plant. This drew protests from Japan's neighbours, including China, over safety concerns. The United Nations atomic energy regulator IAEA said the waste water was safe and would have a ""negligible"" impact on people and the environment. In response to the new energy plan announced this week, Greenpeace said promoting nuclear energy is ""outrageous"" when the fallout from Fukushima is still ongoing. ""There is no justification for continuing to rely on nuclear energy, which remains toxic for tens of thousands of years, produces radioactive waste that requires long-term management, and carries risks like earthquakes and terrorism,"" the group said. To meet the government's goal, experts say 33 reactors must be put back online, but the current pace of safety checks as well as residents' objections in some areas will make this difficult. Many of these nuclear plants are old and will need to be refitted with new technology for them to function safely. ""That most difficult problem is that each nuclear power plant is in a different location and will need its own safety protocol and infrastructure,"" Yamagiwa said. ""We must check each of them carefully. It still takes time."" In recent months, regulators have given several old reactors approval to keep operating. In October 2024 Japan's oldest reactor, Takahama nuclear power plant, was given the go-ahead to continue operations, making it the first reactor in the country to get approval to operate beyond 50 years."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8j88gym3ro,'Everyone must go': New Zealand's tourism drive draws ire,2025-02-18T09:41:10.910Z,Koh Ewe,"Depending on how you read it, New Zealand's latest tourism tagline can be a well-meaning plea for people to visit - or a threat to kick Kiwis out. ""Everyone Must Go!"" reads a slogan printed across posters of people in New Zealand's majestic landscapes - part of a NZ$500,000 ($285,000; £227,000) campaign unveiled on Sunday. But what was meant as a catchy call to action aimed at Australian tourists has been accused of being tone-deaf, as New Zealand deals with record emigration rates and unemployment. The government has defended the campaign, with Prime Minister Christopher Luxon saying he ""[appreciates] there's lots of chat about whether everyone loves the slogan or not"". ""The fact that we're talking about it is a good thing. It's a great thing,"" he added. Cushla Tangaere-Manuel, tourism spokesperson for the opposition Labour Party, told local news outlet Radio New Zealand (RNZ) that the new slogan ""makes New Zealand sound like we're in a clearance bin at a sale"". ""The irony of that messaging is, that's how Aotearoa New Zealanders are feeling right now,"" she said, pointing to the ""many cuts"" that residents have experienced. Job cuts to the public sector over the past year, as part of the government's austerity push, have affected thousands of people. Meanwhile, people are moving out of the country in record numbers. Official figures show that there were nearly 130,000 departures last year - though that was offset by the arrival of nearly 160,000 immigrants. ""New Zealanders are voting with their feet, leaving in record high numbers,"" Labour MP Barbara Edmonds wrote on X on Monday. ""Is their real tourism plan 'Everyone Must Go' - for Kiwis?"" Others associated the slogan with demand for lavatories. ""I think 'Everyone Must Go' might refer to the need for toilets in some of our high-tourist spots. I mean, the queues are ridiculous,"" Green Party MP Celia Wade-Brown told RNZ. ""They don't go kayaking, they don't go diving, but, my goodness, they queue at the toilets."" Tourism minister Louise Upston said in a statement on Sunday that ""the campaign tagline of 'Everyone must go' lets Australia know that New Zealand is a 'must visit' destination, and that we're ready and waiting to welcome them now"". New Zealand's tourism numbers have yet to bounce back to pre-pandemic levels, and authorities are channelling efforts into attracting visitors from neighbouring Australia, its largest source of tourists. Last year, New Zealand welcomed more than 1.2 million visitors from Australia. But Upston said visitors numbers were only 88% of that in 2019. Luxon said he hoped the latest campaign would boost Australian visitor numbers by 5%. ""It would be totally and utterly tragic if those Australians don't get here before they do die,"" he said. The month-long tourism campaign is set to start on Thursday."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2k2ly8j75o,'Died for stealing chocolate': Pakistan anger over death of child maid,2025-02-18T09:02:20.287Z,Azadeh Moshiri Usman Zahid,"A couple in north-east Pakistan has been detained on suspicion of murdering a 13-year-old girl who worked for them as a maid, for allegedly stealing chocolates. The girl who goes only by one name, Iqra, succumbed to multiple injuries in hospital last Wednesday. A preliminary police investigation said she had been tortured. The case in Rawalpindi has sparked widespread outrage and posts with the hashtag #JusticeforIqra having garnered tens of thousands of views, and reignited a debate over child labour and the mistreatment of domestic workers. Laws pertaining to child labour can vary across the country, but children under the age of 15 cannot be employed as domestic workers in the province of Punjab. ""I felt completely shattered inside when she died,"" Iqra's father, Sana Ullah, told the BBC. He said that he had received a call from the police about Iqra last Wednesday. When he rushed to the hospital, he saw Iqra lying on a bed, unconscious. She died minutes later. Iqra began working as a maid from the age of eight. Her father, a 45-year-old farmer, said he had sent her to work because he was in debt. After working for a few employers, she went to work for the couple two years ago, who have eight children of their own. She was earning about £23 ($28) per month. Police said Iqra had been accused of stealing chocolates from her employers, adding that a preliminary investigation showed that Iqra had been tortured. Police also say there was evidence of frequent abuse. Pictures and videos obtained by the BBC showed multiple fractures in her legs and arms, as well as a serious injury to her head. An autopsy is being conducted to assess the full extent of her injuries, and the police has told the BBC that they were still awaiting the final medical report. ""My heart cries tears of blood. How many... are subjected to violence in their homes every day for a trivial job of a few thousand?"" activist Shehr Bano wrote on X. ""How long will the poor continue to lower their daughters into graves in this way?"" Others have pointed out that her murder was allegedly triggered by something so minor. ""She died over chocolate?"" asked one Pakistani user on X. ""This is not just a crime, it's a reflection of [a] system that enables [the] rich to treat [the] poor as disposable,"" another said. Iqra's employers, Rashid Shafiq and his wife Sana, have been arrested, along with a Quran teacher, who worked for the family. The teacher had brought Iqra to the hospital and left after telling hospital staff that the girl's father had died and her mother was not around. Police told the BBC it was unclear if she believed this to be the truth. Iqra's father says he wants to see ""those responsible for my daughter's death punished"". Despite the public outrage such cases usually garner, they are typically settled out of court and it's rare for suspects to be successfully prosecuted. In 2018, a judge and his wife were sentenced to three years in jail for torturing their then 10-year-old maid in what had been a highly publicised case that sparked outrage across the country. But they later had their sentences reduced to one year. Tayyaba was found with severe injuries, which the Pakistan Institute of Medical Science said included burns to her hands and feet. Pictures of the girl also showed cuts and bruising to her face, along with a swollen left eye. She told prosecutors she was beaten for losing a broom. Under Pakistani law, victims or their families have the right to forgive suspects in a number of serious crimes. To do so, they have to state in court that they forgive a suspect ""in the name of God"". In reality, legal observers say that the primary motive for that ""forgiveness"" is normally financial, and paying victims is not illegal. About 3.3 million children in Pakistan are engaged in child labour, according to the United Nations Children's Fund (Unicef). Moreover, women and young girls make up the vast majority of Pakistan's 8.5 million domestic workers, according to the International Labour Organisation (ILO)."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20g0dxkv3mo,Pritam Singh: Singapore opposition leader guilty of lying to parliament,2025-02-17T08:35:46.544Z,Kelly Ng,"Singapore's opposition leader Pritam Singh has been found guilty of lying under oath to a parliamentary committee. A court imposed the maximum fine of S$7,000 ($5,223; £4,148) for each of two charges. Singh said that he would appeal against the conviction and sentence. The charges relate to Singh's handling of Raeesah Khan, a former lawmaker from his party, who lied to parliament in a separate case. The verdict in this high-profile trial comes as Singapore is gearing up for its next general election, which must be held by November. Singh's Workers' Party holds nine out of 87 elected seats in parliament. Under Singapore's constitution, any MP can lose their seat or be barred from running for office for five years if they are fined at least S$10,000 or jailed for more than a year. The election department has since clarified that the S$10,000 threshold only applies to a single offence, according to local media. This means Singh's fines will not trigger disqualification. ""The question on most people's minds is the consequences for the upcoming election,"" Chong Ja-Ian, associate professor at the National University of Singapore, told the BBC. Singh's case could either be ""played up"" by state media or ""fizzle out"" of public attention, he said. Singh told reporters outside the court on Monday that he intended to run in the upcoming election. The verdict on Monday, which lasted more than two hours, was delivered to a packed courtroom. Members of the press who could not fit into the courtroom, including the BBC, viewed a livestream of the verdict from a separate room. District Judge Luke Tan, who delivered the verdict, said several pieces of evidence showed that Singh ""never wanted Ms Khan to clarify [her] lie"" and had ""direct and intimate involvement"" in guiding Khan to continue her narrative. Prosecutors sought the maximum fine of S$7,000 for each of Singh's two charges, while the defence asked for S$4,000. Singh, 48, maintained his innocence throughout the trial, arguing that he had wanted to give Khan time to deal with what was a sensitive issue. Singh's case has gripped the city-state, where a usually uneventful political scene - dominated by the ruling People's Action Party - has in recent years seen a rare string of scandals. The saga started in August 2021 when Khan claimed in parliament that she had witnessed the police misbehave towards a sexual assault victim. She later admitted that her anecdote was not true. Khan was fined S$35,000 for lying and abusing her parliamentary privilege. She has since resigned from the party and parliament. During a parliamentary committee investigation into the incident later that year, Khan testified that the party's leaders, including Singh, had told her to ""continue with the narrative"" despite finding out that it was not true. This was prior to her eventual admission. Singh denied this, but also said that he had given Khan ""too much time to settle herself before closing this issue with her"". The parliamentary committee concluded that Singh was not being truthful and referred the case to the public prosecutor. Judge Tan said on Monday that Singh's actions after learning of Khan's lie were ""strongly indicative that the accused did not want Ms Khan to clarify the untruth at some point"". Singh's Workers' Party is the opposition party with the largest presence in parliament. The party made significant gains during the 2020 election, increasing their number of seats from six to 10 - the biggest victory for the opposition since Singapore gained independence in 1965. Singh was named the opposition leader after the polls. One of those seats has since been vacated by Khan.  Additional reporting by Ewe Koh"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy9l9elr95zo,"Special Forces rejected 2,000 credible asylum claims from Afghan commandos, MoD confirms",2025-02-17T00:01:35.934Z,"Hannah O'Grady, Joel Gunter, and Rory Tinman","UK Special Forces command rejected resettlement applications from more than 2,000 Afghan commandos who had shown credible evidence of service in units that fought alongside the SAS and SBS, the Ministry of Defence has confirmed for the first time. UK Special Forces officers appear to have rejected every application from a former Afghan commando referred to them for sponsorship, despite the Afghan units having fought with the British on life-threatening missions against the Taliban. The MoD had previously denied there was a blanket policy to reject members of the units - known as the Triples - but the BBC has not been able to find any evidence that UK Special Forces (UKSF) supported any resettlement applications. Asked if UKSF had supported any applications, the MoD declined to answer the question. The Triples - so-called because their designations were CF 333 and ATF 444 - were set up, trained, and paid by UK Special Forces and supported the SAS and SBS on operations in Afghanistan. When the country fell to the Taliban in 2021, they were judged to be in grave danger of reprisal and were entitled to apply for resettlement to the UK. The rejection of their applications was controversial because it came at a time when a public inquiry in the UK was investigating allegations that British Special Forces had committed war crimes on operations in Afghanistan where the Triples were present. The inquiry has the power to compel witnesses who are in the UK, but not non-UK nationals who are overseas. If resettled, former members of the Triples could be compelled by the inquiry to provide potentially significant evidence. BBC Panorama revealed last year that UK Special Forces command had been given veto power over their resettlement applications and denied them asylum in Britain. The revelation caused a wave of anger among some former members of the SAS and others who served with the Afghan units. The MoD initially denied the existence of the veto, suggesting that the BBC's reporting had been inaccurate, but then-Defence Minister Andrew Murrison was later forced to tell the House of Commons the government had misled parliament in its denials. The confirmation of the more than 2,000 rejections emerged in court hearings earlier this month during a legal challenge brought by a former member of the Triples. Lawyers for the MoD applied for a restriction order which temporarily prevented the BBC from reporting on the relevant parts of the proceedings, before withdrawing their application last week under challenge. Documents disclosed in court also showed that at the same time the MoD was denying the existence of the veto, it already knew that every rejection decision made by UK Special Forces was potentially unsound and would have to be independently reviewed. Mike Martin MP, a member of the defence select committee and former British Army officer who served in Afghanistan, told the BBC the rejections were ""extremely concerning"". ""There is the appearance that UK Special Forces blocked the Afghan special forces applications because they were witnesses to the alleged UK war crimes currently being investigated in the Afghan inquiry,"" Martin said. ""If the MoD is unable to offer any explanation, then the matter should be included in the inquiry,"" he added. Johnny Mercer, the former Conservative MP for Plymouth Moor View, who served alongside the SBS in Afghanistan, testified to the Afghan inquiry that he had spoken to former members of the Triples and heard ""horrific"" allegations of murder by UK Special Forces. Mercer said it was ""very clear to me that there is a pool of evidence that exists within the Afghan [special forces] community that are now in the United Kingdom that should contribute to this Inquiry"". The MoD began a review last year of all 2,022 resettlement applications referred to and rejected by UK Special Forces. All contained what MoD caseworkers on the resettlement scheme regarded as ""credible"" evidence of service with the Triples units. The government said at the time that the review would take 12 weeks, but more than a year later it has yet to be completed. Some rejections have already been overturned, allowing former Triples to come to the UK. But the MoD has refused to inform the Afghan commandos whether they are in scope of the review or if their rejections were upheld, unless they write to the MoD. Many are in hiding in Afghanistan, making it difficult to obtain legal representation or pro-actively contact the MoD. Dozens have reportedly been beaten, tortured, or killed by the Taliban since the group regained control of the country. ""Although decisions have been overturned, it's too late for some people,"" said a former Triples officer. ""The delays have caused a lot of problems. People have been captured by the Taliban or lost their lives,"" he said. The officer said that the Afghan commandos worked alongside British Special Forces ""like brothers"" and felt ""betrayed"" by the widespread rejections. ""If Special Forces made these rejections they should say why. They should have to answer,"" he said. The MoD is now facing a legal challenge to aspects of the review, including the decision not to inform applicants whether their case is being reviewed or disclose the criteria used to select those in scope. The legal challenge is being brought by a former senior member of the Triples who is now in the UK, on behalf of commandos still in Afghanistan. ""Our client's focus is on his soldiers left behind in Afghanistan, some of whom have been killed while they wait for these heavily delayed protection decisions,"" said Dan Carey, a partner at the law firm Deighton Pierce Glynn. ""As things stand they have a right to request a reassessment of a decision they haven't even been told about. And there are others who think they are part of the Triples Review when the secret criteria would tell them that their cases aren't even being looked at."" Lawyers acting for the former member of the Triples also heavily criticised the level of disclosure in the case by the MoD, which has not handed over any documentation from within UK Special Forces or government records about the decision-making process that led to the rejections. In court filings, they criticised the ""total inadequacy"" of the MoD's disclosure, calling it an ""an obvious failure to comply with the duty of candour and to provide necessary explanation"" of the process. New evidence that emerged last week in court also showed that the MoD appeared to have rejected out of hand some applicants who served with UK Special Forces in Afghanistan after 2014 - when Britain's conventional armed forces left Helmand province - without even referring them to UK Special Forces headquarters for sponsorship. The MoD has not explained the reasoning behind the policy, which was kept secret from applicants. A spokesperson for the MoD said that after 2014 the UK's role ""evolved from combat operations to primarily training, advising and assisting CF 333, who were under the command of the Afghan Ministry of Interior"". But officers who served with UK Special Forces told the BBC that the Triples continued to support British-led operations after 2014. ""Saying the Triples didn't support UK Special Forces operations after 2014 isn't true at all,"" said former officer who served with UKSF. ""We had a squadron of CF 333 with us. We worked closely together. These were NATO targets, UK planned operations,"" he said. The Ministry of Defence has previously told the BBC: ""There has been no evidence to suggest that any part of the MoD has sought to prevent former members of the Afghan specialist units from giving evidence to the inquiry.""

The 24-year-old was found in her home in the city's Seongsu-dong district by a friend at around 16:55 (07:55 GMT) on Sunday. Officers said no signs of foul play had been found and they were investigating the cause of death. Kim began her career as a child actor and was seen as one of South Korea's most promising young actresses. Born in Seoul in 2000, she rose to prominence with her role in 2009 film A Brand New Life - which saw her appear at the Cannes Film Festival. She went on to star in South Korea's highest grossing film of 2010 The Man from Nowhere and 2012 thriller The Neighbour, for which she received award recognition. Other notable roles include the 2014 film A Girl at My Door and television roles such as Mirror of the Witch in 2016. The actress largely withdrew from the public eye in 2022 due to a drink driving incident, for which she was fined 20 million won (£11,000) in April 2023. Kim's last role was in Netflix's 2023 Korean drama Bloodhounds. Variety reported that most of her role was edited out due to the driving incident."

But on Saturday night, a deadly crush - reportedly caused by overcrowding - killed at least 18 people and left several injured. According to officials, two trains had been delayed at the station, while a third - heading to Prayagraj city where the massive Hindu religious festival, Kumbh Mela, is being held - was waiting to depart as people pushed against each other. The crush occurred after ""a passenger slipped and fell on the stairs"", a spokesperson for Indian Railways said. Opposition leaders have criticised the government, alleging that Indian Railways did not make adequate arrangements to manage crowds at the station. An investigation has been launched, and authorities have announced compensation for the victims. When asked by the BBC about safety and security at the station, Pankaj Gangwar, Principal Chief Security Commissioner of Northern Railway, said ""let the investigation be completed first"". Crushes like these are not unheard of in India, where there is frequent overcrowding at religious events, festivals and public spaces. Last month, 30 people were killed and dozens injured in a crush at the Kumbh Mela. Crowds at the railway station were also not unexpected - trains are by far the cheapest long-distance mode of transport in India and it is common for the number of passengers to far exceed the capacity of trains. Eyewitnesses and the families of victims have been recounting their ordeal. Many of them were angry at authorities and police officials at the railway station, who they say did not act in time. Some eyewitnesses said the crush was not limited to one place but took place on the overhead bridge, staircases and platforms. Bipin Jha was at the station to meet his wife Mamta, who was arriving on a train. She died in the crush. ""I met her at the platform and we were walking on the footbridge overhead when she was trapped in the crush. She died in front of my eyes. I will live my life with the guilt of not saving her,"" he says. ""We were on the stairs, suddenly we felt a push from behind. We fell, along with many others, and were trapped under bodies. I was barely breathing,"" said Seema, whose sister-in law Pinky Devi died on the staircase. Usha Devi, who was travelling to the eastern state of Bihar for her nephew's wedding, said chaos erupted the moment she reached the platform. ""Many people fell. Everywhere, there were scattered belongings, food items and clothes. I was on the verge of fainting. So many people were collapsing. The crowd was so dense that we couldn't board our train."" Umesh Giri's wife Shilam Devi was among the victims. ""The crowd became uncontrollable,"" he told BBC Hindi while waiting outside the mortuary at Delhi's Maulana Azad Medical College. ""I saw several bodies already lying there. People were colliding with each other, and others started falling over them,"" said Mr Giri, who was also injured. He added that help took time to arrive and that he pleaded with officers for help. Senior police and railway officials at the scene did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. Most of the victims were taken to the Lok Nayak Jai Prakash Hospital in New Delhi, where police and paramilitary forces were deployed, and railway authorities had set up a help desk to assist families. Journalists were not allowed to enter the hospital on Saturday. Relatives of victims shared their grief with reporters waiting outside, while also expressing anger at the facilities in the hospital. ""Multiple people were crammed onto a single bed,"" alleged Shobha, the sister-in-law of Shilam Devi. Others coming out of the hospital also confirmed this. Hospital authorities did not respond to the BBC's request for comment. At Lady Hardinge Hospital, the grieving family of Riya, 7, completed the paperwork so they could receive her body. ""No child deserves to die like this"", her uncle Vivek said, wiping away tears."

Thousands of people reportedly crammed into the railway station on Saturday night as they tried to board delayed trains. Four of the victims were children, while 10 were women, according to a list released by officials. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said his thoughts were ""with all those who have lost their loved ones"" in a post on X. Crowd crushes are common in India where there is frequent overcrowding at religious events, festivals and public spaces. The incident comes weeks after 30 people were killed in a pre-dawn crush at the religious festival, Kumbh Mela, in northern India, where tens of millions of Hindus had gathered to bathe in sacred river waters on one of the holy days of the six-week event. In Delhi, witnesses told BBC Hindi that a ""huge crowd"" had gathered at the station, through which many people were travelling to and from the Kumbh Mela, which is being held in Prayagraj city in neighbouring Uttar Pradesh state. Hundreds of people were also waiting for trains to other places. According to officials, two trains had been delayed at the station, while a third - heading to Prayagraj - was waiting to depart. Ruby Devi said the crowd at the Indian capital's main railway station had been so big she was unable to get inside. Umesh Giri, whose wife Shilam Devi died in the crush, said that the crowd was ""uncontrollable"" as he tried to board the Prayagraj Express. Dharmendra Singh, who was also travelling to Prayagraj, told India's PTI news agency that there were"" far more people than I have ever seen at this station"". ""In front of me, six or seven women were taken away on stretchers. KPS Malhotra, deputy commissioner of police (railways), said that authorities were investigating what led to the crush. ""This happened due to a delay in two trains arriving and more people gathering at the station,"" he said. Opposition leaders have criticised the government, accusing them of administrative failure. ""Considering the large number of devotees going to Prayagraj, better arrangements should have been made at the station,"" Rahul Gandhi, the leader of opposition in India's parliament, posted on X."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgezm9per7o,"'I believe in my guide runner more than myself', says blind Indian athlete",2025-02-16T01:23:40.373Z,Divya Arya,"""When I was growing up, everyone in my village would say: 'She is blind, she is a waste',"" says Rakshitha Raju. Now, aged 24, she is one of India's top middle distance para athletes. ""It makes me so proud,"" she says. Rakshitha was born blind in a remote village in southern India and had lost both her parents by the age of 10. She was raised by her grandmother who is hearing and speech impaired. ""Both of us are disabled, so my grandma understood me,"" she says. When Rakshitha was about 13, the sports teacher at her school took her aside and told her she had the potential to be a great athlete. ""I wondered: 'How? I am blind, so how do I run on a track I can't see?'"" she recalls. Her teacher explained that visually impaired runners can have a guide, who runs alongside them. The athletes are joined by a tether - a short strap with a loop on both ends for each of them to hold on to. For a while, other pupils acted as guide runners for Rakshitha. Then in 2016, when she was 15, she competed in the National Games, where a man called Rahul Balakrishna spotted her. A middle-distance runner, Rahul had previously competed in the 1500m himself. He had been introduced to para athletics by a coach at the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) a few years earlier, while recovering from an injury. There was a shortage of guides and coaches and Rahul decided to take on both roles. The government pays him a salary for the coaching side of his work, but it does not pay guide runners. However, if a visually impaired runner wins an international competition, their guide also gets a medal - something Rahul had not achieved in his own running career. ""I felt proud that I could do this for myself and my country,"" he says. He invested his own time and money to support Rakshitha, helping her move to Bangalore in 2018 so she could have access to better training facilities. When they are running ""it's the small things that matter"", says Rahul. ""When they are approaching a curve, the guide has to alert the athlete or when a competitor is overtaking, he has to tell the athlete so they can put in a little more effort."" Competition rules mean they can't hold hands - they can only be connected by the tether, and the guide-runner is not allowed to push, pull or otherwise propel the visually impaired athlete. Over time, the pair have built up a strong bond and now ""I believe in my guide runner more than myself"", says Rakshitha. They won gold medals at the 2018 and 2023 Asian Games, returning to a resounding welcome in Rakshitha's village. She smiles as she describes how the people who used to taunt her organised a procession for her, cheering and waving flags. Rakshitha became the first blind Indian woman to qualify for the 1500m in the Paralympics and she competed with Rahul in Paris in 2024. They missed out on a medal in France, but India's only other visually impaired female athlete to qualify for Paris, sprinter Simran Sharma, did make it to the podium, bringing home a bronze. Simran is partially sighted and when she started running, she ran alone. But in 2021, when Simran competed in the Tokyo Paralympics, she strayed out of her lane and realised that she would need a guide if she wanted to carry on running. But the search proved challenging. ""It can't be any athlete. You need someone whose technique matches yours and who runs as fast as you do,"" she explains. Simran finally spotted a young athlete called Abhay Kumar, who was training at the same place as her. The 18-year-old was between competitions and guiding Simran was an opportunity for him to get experience at international events. ""They sent me videos and after watching them I thought: 'I am a fast learner, this is going to be easy',"" he says. ""But when I ran for the first time, it turned out to be very difficult."" Every movement has to be synchronised. Simran and Abhay did not have time to practice together for long before their first international competition - the 2024 World Para Athletics Championships in Japan - just a few weeks after they met. Their first race, the 100m, ended in disaster. ""Neither of us knew the rules properly,"" says Simran. Abhay ""thought he had to stop to let me cross the line first, so he stopped completely"". They were disqualified as he should have kept going and crossed the line just behind her. But by the time they got to the 200m race, they knew what they were doing and struck gold. Simran became the World Champion in the T12 category. Riding on that high, they went to the Paralympics in Paris. They came fourth in the 100m, but won bronze in the 200m race and Simran became the first Indian woman with a visual impairment to win a Paralympic medal. But Simran is worried how long Abhay will stay as her guide. He has his own career to think of too. Although guide runners get a medal when a pair wins, the Paralympic Committee of India (PCI) says it cannot support guides with salaries, cash prizes or offer a long-term career path. ""All we can do is support short-term needs like their food, accommodation, transport and training facilities,"" says the PCI's national athletics coach Mr Satyanarayana, who goes by one name. Both Rakshitha and Simran now have sponsorship deals which help fund their training. They pay their guides themselves and give them a share of any prize money they win. But Rahul and Abhay would like more support from the state and want to be allowed to apply for public sector jobs reserved for sportsmen and women - like the athletes they work with. Despite the uncertainty around her future with Abhay, Simran is already looking ahead to the next Paralympic Games in Los Angeles. ""I won't rest till I change the colour of this medal,"" she says, hoping that next time she will win gold. Rakshitha is hoping for a medal next time too, with Rahul at her side. ""She must win a medal,"" he says. ""There are many like her in villages. They don't know about sports and the possibilities. Rakshitha would be a role model for them.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93lp2wd0qzo,The A-level student who became an enemy of the Chinese state,2025-02-16T00:00:27.535Z,Frances Mao,"Just over a year ago, Chloe Cheung was sitting her A-levels. Now she's on a Chinese government list of wanted dissidents. The choir girl-turned-democracy activist woke up to news in December that police in Hong Kong had issued a $HK1 million ($100,000; £105,000) reward for information leading to her capture abroad. ""I actually just wanted to take a gap year after school,"" Chloe, 19, who lives in London, told the BBC. ""But I've ended up with a bounty!"" Chloe is the youngest of 19 activists accused of breaching a national security law introduced by Beijing in response to huge pro-democracy protests in the former British colony five years ago. In 2021, she and her family moved to the UK under a special visa scheme for Hong Kongers. She can probably never return to her home city and says she has to be careful about where she travels. Her protest work has made her a fugitive of the Chinese state, a detail not lost on me as we meet one icy morning in the café in the crypt of Westminster Abbey. In medieval England, churches provided sanctuary from arrest. Hong Kong police issued the arrest warrant on Christmas Eve, using the only photo they appear to have on file for her – in which she is aged 11. ""It freaked me out at first,"" she says, but then she fired back a public response. ""I didn't want the government to think I was scared. Because if Hong Kongers in Hong Kong can't speak out for themselves any more, then we outside of the city - who can speak freely without fear- we have to speak up for them."" Chloe attended her first protests with her school friends, in the early days of Hong Kong's 2019 demonstrations. Protesters turned out in huge numbers against a bill seen as extending China's control over the territory, which had enjoyed semi-autonomy since Britain handed it back in 1997. ""Politics were never in my life before… so I went to the first protest with curiosity,"" she said. She saw police tear-gassing demonstrators and an officer stepping on a protester's neck. ""I was so shocked,"" she says. ""That moment actually changed how I looked at the world."" Growing up in a city that was part of China but that had retained many of its freedoms – she had thought Hong Kongers could talk about ""what we like and don't like"" and ""could decide what Hong Kong's future looked like"". But the violent crackdown by authorities made her realise that wasn't the case. She began joining protests, at first without her parents' knowledge. ""I didn't tell them at the time because they didn't care [about politics],"" she says. But when things started to get ""really crazy"", she browbeat her parents into coming with her. At the march, police fired tear gas at them and they had to run away into the subway. Her parents got the ""raw experience"", she says, not the version they'd seen blaming protesters on TV. After months of demonstrations, Beijing passed the National Security Law in 2020. The authorities in Beijing and Hong Kong argue the law is necessary to maintain stability and has not weakened the city's autonomy. But most of the freedoms that had set Hong Kong apart from mainland China - freedom of expression, the right to political assemblies – were suddenly gone. Symbols of democracy in the city, including statues and independent newspapers, were torn down, shut or erased. Those publicly critical of the government - from teachers to millionaire moguls like British citizen Jimmy Lai - faced trials and eventually, jail. In response to the crackdown, the UK opened its doors to Hong Kongers under a new scheme, the British National Overseas (BNO) visa. Chloe's family were some of the first to take up the offer, settling in Leeds, which offered the cheapest Airbnb they could find. Chloe had to do her GCSEs halfway through the school term, and during a pandemic lockdown. At first, she felt isolated. It was hard to make friends and she had trouble speaking English, she says. There were few other Hong Kongers around. Unable to afford international student fees of more than £20,000 a year, she took a job with the Committee for Freedom in Hong Kong Foundation, a pro-democracy NGO. When China started putting bounties on dissidents' heads in 2023, they targeted prominent protest leaders and opposition politicians. Chloe, still finishing her A-levels at the time, thought was she too small-fry to ever be a target. Her inclusion underlines Beijing's determination to pursue activists overseas. A Hong Kong government statement said: ""Any individuals who endanger national security should not believe that being overseas will allow them to evade criminal responsibility. ""We must emphasise that the Constitution and the Basic Law steadfastly safeguard the rights and freedoms enjoyed by Hong Kong people."" Chloe says the bounty puts a target on her back and encourages third parties to report on her actions in the UK. China has been the leading country over the past decade trying to silence exiled dissidents around the world, according to a report this week. Another Hong Kong dissident who reported being assaulted in London blamed the attacks on Chinese government-linked actors. And last May, British police charged three men with gathering intelligence for Hong Kong and breaking into a home. One of the men was soon after found dead in unclear circumstances. ""They're only interested in Hong Kongers because they want to scare off others,"" Chloe says. She says many of those who've moved over in recent years stay quiet, partly because they still have family in Hong Kong. ""Most of the BNO visa holders told me this because they don't want to take risks,"" she says. ""It's sad but we can't blame them."" On the day her arrest warrant was announced, Foreign Secretary David Lammy said the UK would not tolerate ""any attempts by foreign governments to coerce, intimidate, harass or harm their critics overseas"". He added the government was committed to supporting Hong Kongers in the UK. But more needs to be done, says Chloe, who's spent the first weeks of this year lobbying Westminster. In the past fortnight she has met Prime Minister Keir Starmer at a Lunar New Year event at Downing Street, and shadow foreign secretary Priti Patel, who later tweeted: ""We must not give an inch to any transnational repression in the UK."" But she worries whether the UK's recent overtures to China could mean fewer protections for Hong Kongers. ""We just don't know what will happen to us, and whether the British government will protect us if they really want to protect their trade relationship with China."" Does she feel scared on the streets in London? It's not as bad as what activists back home face, she says. ""When I think of what [they] face… it's actually not that big a deal that I got a bounty overseas."" Bounty targets Update 18 February 2025: This article has been updated to include a response from the Hong Kong government."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm29drxjlxmo,India anger as judge frees man accused of raping wife who then died,2025-02-15T01:00:34.253Z,Geeta Pandey,"Warning: This report contains some disturbing details An Indian court's ruling that a man's forced ""unnatural sex"" with his wife is not an offence has led to huge outrage and sparked renewed calls for better protections for married women. The controversial order has also brought back into the spotlight the issue of marital rape in a country which has stubbornly refused to criminalise it. Earlier this week, a high court judge in the central Indian state of Chhattisgarh set free a 40-year-old man who was convicted by a trial court in 2019 of rape and unnatural sex with his wife, who died within hours of the alleged assault. The lower court had also found the man guilty of ""culpable homicide not amounting to murder"". He was sentenced to ""rigorous imprisonment for 10 years"" on each count, with all the sentences to run concurrently. But on Monday, the High Court's Justice Narendra Kumar Vyas acquitted the man of all charges, saying that since India did not recognise marital rape, the husband could not be considered guilty of non-consensual sex or any non-consensual unnatural sexual act. The judgement has been met with anger, as activists, lawyers and campaigners renew their calls to criminalise marital rape in India. ""To watch this man walk away is unacceptable. This judgement may be correct legally, but it is ethically and morally abhorrent,"" said lawyer and gender rights activist Sukriti Chauhan. ""An order that absolves a man of such a crime, to say it's not a crime, is the darkest hour in our legal system,"" she told the BBC. ""It has shaken us to the core. This needs to change and change quickly."" Priyanka Shukla, a lawyer in Chhattisgarh, said a judgement like this ""sends out the message that because you're the husband, you have rights. And you can do anything, you can even get away with murder"". She added that this is not the first time a court has given such a judgement, and there is always anger. ""This time, the outrage is more because it is so gruesome and the woman died."" The court documents make for grim reading. According to the prosecution, the incident took place on the night of 11 December 2017, when the husband, who worked as a driver, ""committed unnatural sex with the victim against her will… causing her a lot of pain"". After he left for work, she sought help from his sister and another relative, who took her to hospital where she died a few hours later. In her statement to the police and her dying declaration to a magistrate, the woman said she became ill ""due to forceful sexual intercourse by her husband"". A dying declaration carries weight in court and legal experts say it is generally enough for conviction, unless contradicted by other evidence. While convicting the man in 2019, the trial court had relied heavily on her dying declaration and the post-mortem report, which stated ""the cause of death was peritonitis and rectal perforation"" - simply put, severe injuries to her abdomen and rectum. Justice Vyas, however, saw matters differently – he questioned the ""sanctity"" of the dying statement, noted that some of the witnesses had retracted their statements and, most importantly, said that marital rape was not an offence in India. The lower court's conviction was ""a rarest of rare case"", Ms Shukla said, ""probably because the woman died"". ""But what is shocking about the high court order is that there's not even one sympathetic comment from the judge."" Considering the nature of the assault, the high court's order has come as a shock for many, who believe the judge should not have dismissed the case so lightly. India is among more than 30 countries - along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Saudi Arabia - where marital rape is not a criminal offence. A number of petitions have been filed in recent years seeking to strike down Section 375 of the Indian Penal Code, which has been in existence since 1860. The British colonial-era law mentions several ""exemptions"" - or situations in which sex is not rape - and one of them is ""by a man with his own wife"" if she is not under 15 years. Britain outlawed marital rape in 1991 but India, which recently rewrote its criminal code, retained the regressive law in its new statute book. The idea is rooted in the belief that consent for sex is ""implied"" in marriage and that a wife cannot retract it later. Campaigners say such an argument is untenable in this day and age, and that forced sex is rape, regardless of who does it. But in a country where marriage and family are considered sacrosanct, the issue has polarised opinions and there's strong resistance to the idea of criminalising marital rape. The Indian government, religious leaders and men's rights activists have strongly opposed the move. In October last year, the government told the Supreme Court that criminalisation of marital rape would be ""excessively harsh"". The federal home ministry said it ""may lead to serious disturbances in the institution of marriage"". Authorities also insist that there are enough laws to protect married women against sexual violence. But campaigners say India cannot hide behind archaic laws to deny women bodily agency. ""A lot of people say the constitution cannot enter your bedroom,"" Ms Chauhan said. ""But doesn't it grant women - like all citizens - fundamental rights to safety and security? What kind of redundant country do we live in that we remain quiet when a woman has to face this level of violence?"" she asks. Violence within marriage is rampant in India. According to a recent government survey, 32% of married women face physical, sexual or emotional violence by their husbands and 82% of married women, aged 18-49, who have experienced sexual violence said their current husbands were the perpetrators. And even that doesn't give the true scale of the problem, Ms Shukla said, because a majority of women do not report violence, especially sexual violence, out of shame. ""In my experience, women are not trusted when they complain, everyone says it must be fake. The only time such cases are taken seriously is when a woman dies or the assault is particularly gruesome,"" the lawyer said. Ms Chauhan believes nothing will change until the law changes. ""We need to criminalise marital rape. The wife not getting justice after such a gruesome incident deserves a nationwide campaign, which is not born of anger but is serious [and] well thought out."" She added that the government and men's activists try to project it as a ""man versus woman debate"". ""But the demand for criminalising marital rape is not against men, but for the safety and wellbeing of women. Is it not important to ensure women's safety?"""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly5025n2g2o,Japanese woman arrested for squashing bun in shop,2025-02-14T07:41:57.601Z,Koh Ewe and Chie Kobayashi,"A woman in Japan has been arrested for allegedly squashing a bun at a convenience store and leaving without buying the packet of bread. Authorities in the southern city of Fukuoka confirmed to the BBC that the 40-year-old had been arrested on Monday for ""criminal damage"". The woman, who said she was unemployed, claimed she ""only checked the firmness of [the bun] by pressing lightly with my hand"", according to police. The woman had allegedly touched a bag of four black sesame and cream cheese buns. While the bag's wrapper was intact, police said one of the buns was damaged after she pressed it with her right thumb, and the entire bag could not be sold. Police said the owner of the Lawson convenience store had claimed he had seen the woman squashing buns several times in the past. As the woman was leaving the shop on Monday, the owner noticed the bun was damaged and he urged her to pay for the bread, according to police. The bag of buns cost about 180 yen (£0.95; $1.20). She allegedly refused. After following her for 1km (0.6mi), the manager restrained her. The police were called to the scene and they arrested her. In recent years, police have been also cracking down on pranksters who have committed ""sushi terrorism"" in sushi conveyor belt restaurants, such as licking communal soy sauce bottles and squashing sushi meant for diners."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c704d73kjpwo,Why Muslims in India are opposing changes to a property law,2025-02-14T06:34:24.585Z,Meryl Sebastian & Neyaz Farooquee,"A proposal to amend a decades-old law that governs properties worth millions of dollars donated by Indian Muslims over centuries has triggered protests in the country. The properties, which include mosques, madrassas, shelter homes and thousands of acres of land, are called waqf and are managed by a board. The new bill - which introduces more than 40 amendments to the existing law - was introduced in August but was later sent to a joint committee of MPs for discussion. On 13 February, the committee's report on the bill was tabled in both houses of parliament amid protests by opposition leaders. They claimed that their notes of dissent had been deleted, but the federal government denied the allegation. The new bill is likely to incorporate changes suggested by the committee and put to vote in parliament. If it is passed by both houses of parliament, it will be sent to President Droupadi Murmu for her assent before becoming a law. Prime Minister Narendra Modi's government says that the changes they have proposed to the bill are necessary to root out corruption in the management of these properties and address demands for reform from the Muslim community. But several Muslim groups and opposition parties have called the changes politically motivated and an attempt by Modi's Hindu nationalist party to weaken the rights of minorities. In Islamic tradition, a waqf is a charitable or religious donation made by Muslims for the benefit of the community. Such properties cannot be sold or used for any other purpose - which implies that waqf properties belong to God. A vast number of these properties are used for mosques, madrassas, graveyards and orphanages, and many others are vacant or have been encroached upon. The tradition of waqf in India can be traced back to the Delhi Sultanate period in the 12th Century when the early Muslim rulers from Central Asia came to India. The properties are now governed by the Waqf Act, 1995, which mandated the formation of state-level boards. These boards include nominees from the state government, Muslim lawmakers, members of the state bar council, Islamic scholars and managers of waqf properties. The government says that the waqf boards are among India’s largest landholders. There are at least 872,351 waqf properties across India, spanning more than 940,000 acres, with an estimated value of 1.2 trillion rupees ($14.22bn; £11.26bn). Muslim groups agree that corruption is a serious issue in waqf boards - its members have been accused several times of colluding with encroachers to sell waqf land. But critics also say that a significant number of these properties have been encroached by individuals, businesses and government bodies – which too requires immediate attention. A report submitted in 2006 by the Justice Sachar Committee - formed by the earlier Congress party-led government to assess the socioeconomic conditions of Muslims in India - had recommended waqf reform, as it found that the revenues from the boards were low compared to the vast number of properties they managed. The committee estimated that efficient use of the land had the potential to generate an annual revenue of about 120bn rupees (1.4bn; £1.1bn). The current annual revenue, according to some estimates, is around 2bn rupees. The committee also noted that “encroachments by the State, who is the custodian of the Wakf interests, is common”, listing hundreds of instances of such “unauthorised occupation” of waqf land by government authorities. According to government data, at least 58,889 of waqf properties are currently encroached upon, while more than 13,000 are under litigation. The status of more than 435,000 properties remains unknown. The amendments, the government says, address these issues and advance the recommendations made by the Sachar Committee. Parliamentary affairs minister Kiren Rijiju told The Times of India newspaper that the reforms were also necessary as only an elite section in the Muslim community managed these properties. But many Muslims see the proposed changes with scepticism. One of the most contentious aspects of the bill is the change to ownership rules, which would impact historical mosques, dargahs and graveyards owned by the board. Many of these properties - in use by Muslims for generations - lack formal documentation as they were donated orally or without legal records decades or centuries ago. The 1954 Waqf Act recognised such properties under the category of “waqf by user”, but the proposed law omits the provision, leaving the fate of a significant number of these properties uncertain. Professor Mujibur Rehman, author of Shikwa-e-Hind: The Political Future of Indian Muslims, explains that tracing the ownership of such long-standing community properties is complicated, as their management and deed systems have shifted over the centuries from the Mughal system to the British colonial system, and now to the current system. “You can trace personal properties up to a few generations, but tracing community properties is more difficult, as their management keeps changing over time,” Prof Rehman says. Others worry that the new bill may not address the community’s concerns but could instead considerably take away the role of Muslims in controlling waqf properties. That's because the proposed changes include tweaks to the composition of waqf boards, making it compulsory to include non-Muslims as its members. Some agree that a general law mandating people of all religions to be part of boards that run religious institutions is not a bad idea - as it would make processes more secular. But the current move appears to favour majoritarian politics, Prof Rehman says. “There seems to be an attempt not only to get the state’s control over Muslims’ properties, but also of Hindu community over Muslim community’s lives.” Among other crucial changes is the mandatory requirement for boards to register their properties with district collectors, who would recommend to the government whether the waqf’s claim to a property is valid. Critics say this will undermine the powers of the waqf boards. Asaduddin Owaisi, a prominent Muslim MP, alleges that these changes are intended to strip Muslims of their land. The current law requires state governments to appoint a survey commissioner who identifies waqf properties, and subsequently prepares a list. The list is then sent to the state government which issues a legally mandated notification. If unchallenged for a year, the final nature of the property becomes waqf. But some of the changes would mean that the status of several waqf properties will have to be re-established. ""Many have illegally encroached upon waqfs. This means they will get a chance to claim that the property is theirs,” Owaisi recently told reporters. This process, Muslim groups say, will put many historical dargahs and masjids at risk. They say that reform is needed but it must keep the sensitivity and interests of the community in mind. “The diagnosis may be correct,” Prof Rehman says, “but the treatment is not.”"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crke5ngld4lo,Direct rule in violence-hit Indian state after chief minister quits,2025-02-13T15:40:34.619Z,Nikhil Inamdar,"The Indian government has brought the troubled north-eastern state of Manipur under direct federal rule days after Chief Minister N Biren Singh resigned. Singh, from India's governing Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), quit on Sunday after facing months of pressure to step down. Ethnic clashes broke out between the state's majority Meitei and minority Kuki communities in May 2023 over economic benefits, land rights and job quotas. More than 250 people have been killed in the conflict and tens of thousands displaced. The state hit the global headlines in July 2023 when a video showing two women being paraded naked by a mob went viral, sparking outrage in India. While the scale of unrest has reduced since the peak in 2023, divisions between the communities persist and violent incidents continue to occur. Singh's position had become increasingly untenable in recent months with Kuki groups accusing him of favouring the Meitei community, of which he is a member - an accusation he denied. Media reports said there was also rising discontent against him within the BJP. BJP leaders tried but failed to agree on someone to replace him as chief minister. On Thursday evening, the office of President Droupadi Murmu announced that federal rule - known as President's rule in India - had been imposed in the state. ""After receiving a report from the governor and after considering the report and other information received by me, I am satisfied that a situation has arisen in which the government of that state cannot be carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution of India,"" the statement said. Manipur's last assembly session was held in August and Monday was set to be the first day of the new session, but federally-appointed governor Ajay Bhalla released a statement declaring the session ""null and void"". Earlier, opposition Congress party members had said they would bring a no-confidence motion against the chief minister during the session. Congress leader Jairam Ramesh told the ANI news agency that Singh resigned as he sensed the motion would be passed. Ramesh called for federal Home Minister Amit Shah to resign. Opposition leaders have also criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has not visited the state since the violence began. Meanwhile India's Supreme Court is hearing a plea against Singh filed by a Kuki organisation which accuses him of playing a direct role in fuelling the violence. The petitioners have submitted leaked audio tapes to back up their claims. The court has sought a forensic report on the tapes before the next hearing. Singh has denied any wrongdoing. The conflict involves the state's two largest ethnic groups, the majority Meitei and minority Kuki, and their battle over land and influence. Tensions boiled over in May 2023 when Kukis began protesting against demands from the Meiteis to be given official tribal status. The Kukis argued this would strengthen the Meiteis' already strong influence on government and society, allowing them to buy land or settle in predominantly Kuki areas. But there are myriad underlying reasons. The Kukis say a war on drugs waged by the Meitei-led government is a screen to uproot their communities. Since the violence, Manipur has been divided into two camps, with Meiteis inhabiting the Imphal Valley and the Kukis living in the surrounding hill areas. Borders and buffer zones guarded by security forces and community members separate the two regions. Efforts to hold peace talks between the communities by federal and state officials have so far failed to end the conflict."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2d3w90x86po,Hundreds of foreigners freed from Myanmar's scam centres,2025-02-13T06:53:12.388Z,Jonathan Head,"More than 250 people from 20 nationalities who had been working in telecom fraud centres in Myanmar's Karen State have been released by an ethnic armed group and brought to Thailand. The workers, almost all of whom were from African or Asian nations, were received by the Thai army, and are being assessed to find out if they were victims of human trafficking. Last week Thai Prime Minister Paetongtarn Shinawatra met Chinese leader Xi Jinping and promised to shut down the scam centres which have proliferated along the Thai-Myanmar border. Her government has stopped access to power and fuel from the Thai side of the border, and toughened up banking and visa rules to try to prevent scam operators from using Thailand as a transit country for moving workers and cash. Some opposition MPs in Thailand have been pushing for this kind of action for the past two years. Foreign workers are typically lured to these scam centres by offers of good salaries, or in some cases tricked into thinking they will be doing different work in Thailand, not Myanmar. The scammers look for workers with skills in the languages of those who are targeted for cyber-fraud, usually English and Chinese. They are pressed into conducting online criminal activity, ranging from love scams known as ""pig butchering"" and crypto fraud, to money laundering and illegal gambling. Some are willing to do the work, but others are forced to stay, with release only possible if their families pay large ransoms. Some of those who have escaped have described being tortured. The released foreign workers were handed over by the Democratic Karen Benevolent Army, DKBA, one of several armed factions which control territory inside Karen State. These armed groups have been accused of allowing the scam compounds to operate under their protection, and of tolerating the widespread abuse of trafficking victims who are forced to work in the compounds. The Myanmar government has been unable to extend its control over much of Karen State since independence in 1948. On Tuesday, Thailand's Department of Special Investigation, which is similar to the US FBI, requested arrest warrants for three commanders of another armed group known as the Karen National Army. The warrants included Saw Chit Thu, the Karen warlord who struck a deal in 2017 with a Chinese company to build Shwe Kokko, a new city believed to be largely funded by scams. The BBC visited Shwe Kokko at the invitation of Yatai, the company which built the city. Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko. It has put up huge billboards all over town proclaiming, in Chinese, Burmese and English, that forced labour is not allowed, and that ""online businesses"" should leave. But we were told by local people that the scam business was still running, and interviewed a worker who had been employed in one. Like the DKBA, Saw Chit Thu broke away from the main Karen insurgent group, the KNU, in 1994, and allied himself to the Myanmar military. Under pressure from Thailand and China, both Saw Chit Thu and the DKBA have said they are expelling the scam businesses from their territories. The DKBA commander contacted a Thai member of parliament on Tuesday to arrange the handover of the 260 workers. They included 221 men and 39 women, from Ethiopia, Kenya, the Philippines, Malaysia, Pakistan, China, Indonesia, Taiwan, Nepal, Uganda, Laos, Burundi, Brazil, Bangladesh, Nigeria, Tanzania, Sir Lanka, India, Ghana and Cambodia."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3j0e79q52o,Why India fails to protect its domestic workers despite decades of abuse,2025-02-12T22:18:12.482Z,Cherylann Mollan,"Smitha (not her real name), a domestic helper in Delhi for 28 years, can't forget the day she was beaten in public by one of her employers. The woman had accused Smitha - a Dalit woman from the most discriminated against caste in Hinduism's entrenched social hierarchy - of stealing her daughter's earrings and then refused to pay her. ""After many requests, I confronted her in public. That's when she started abusing and hitting me. I held her hands to stop the abuse but the guards came and dragged me out of the housing society and locked the gate,"" Smitha says. She was eventually paid – a measly 1,000 rupees [$11; £9] for a month of sweeping, mopping and washing dishes – after a more sympathetic family intervened on her behalf. But she was banned from entering the housing community and did not bother going to the police as she believed they would not take action. Smitha's story is one among hundreds of thousands of accounts of mistreatment, abuse and sexual assault reported by India's domestic workers. Most are women and many are migrants within the country, belonging to castes that are looked down upon. Last month, India's Supreme Court raised concerns over their exploitation and asked the federal government to look into creating a law to protect them from abuse. But this isn't the first time that an attempt has been made to create such a legal framework. Despite years of advocacy by various groups and federal ministries, no such law has ever been passed. Separate bills proposed in 2008 and 2016, aimed at registering domestic workers and improving their working conditions, have not yet been passed. A national policy drafted in 2019 aimed at including domestic workers under existing labour laws has not been implemented. Sonia George of the Self Employed Women's Association (Sewa), who was part of the task force that formulated the draft policy, calls it one of the ""most comprehensive policies for domestic workers"" yet, but says that successive governments have failed to implement it. As a result, India's vast army of domestic helpers must rely on employer goodwill for basics such as wages or leave or even a baseline of respect. According to official statistics, India has 4.75 million domestic workers, including three million women. But the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates the true numbers to be between 20 and 80 million. ""We have a patronising relationship with the help and not a labour employment relationship,"" says Professor Neetha N from the Centre for Women's Development Studies. ""This maintains the status quo and is one of the biggest hurdles to regulating and legalising domestic work."" As things stand, private homes are not considered to be an establishment or workplace, so domestic work falls outside the purview of social protections such as minimum wages, the right to safe working conditions, the right to unionise and access to social security schemes. At least 14 Indian states, including Andhra Pradesh, Bihar, Karnataka, Kerala, Meghalaya, Rajasthan and Tamil Nadu, have mandated minimum wages for domestic workers and some federal laws, like India's anti-sexual harassment and child labour laws, include domestic workers in their scope. But there is very little awareness among domestic workers that they can take advantage of these provisions, Ms George says, adding that the nature of the profession also poses challenges. Workers are scattered and there is no mechanism to register or even identify them as they generally don't sign any kind of contract with their employers. ""We will need to set up systems to register domestic workers - getting over their 'invisibility' is a big step towards regularising the profession,"" she says. That applies to employers too. ""They are completely invisible in the system and hence escape accountability and responsibility,"" Ms George says. The caste system also poses further complexities - workers from some castes may agree to clean toilets in a home while others from slightly different castes may not. Ultimately the whole concept of domestic work should be redefined, Ms George says. ""Domestic work is considered to be unskilled work but that is not the case in reality. You cannot care for a sick person or cook a meal without being skilled,"" she adds. In addition to failing to pass its own laws or implement its own policy, India has also not yet ratified ILO's Convention 189 – a landmark international agreement that aims to ensure that domestic workers have the same rights and protections as other workers. Despite voting in favour of the convention in 2011, India does not yet conform to all its provisions. India has a ""moral obligation"" to conform to the ILO convention, Ms George says. She adds that having a law will also help regulate private recruitment agencies and prevent the exploitation of domestic workers who go abroad to work. Last year, the wealthy Hinduja family made headlines after a Swiss court found them guilty of exploiting their domestic workers. The family was accused of trafficking vulnerable Indians to Switzerland and forcing them to work in their mansion for excruciatingly long hours without proper pay. The family's lawyers said they would appeal against the verdict. Perhaps the simplest explanation for decades of inaction in the face of a tide of abuses lies in the conflict of interest such regulation poses for India's decision makers, Ms George suggests. ""At the end of the day, the people at the table who have the power to sign off on a bill or a law are also employers of domestic workers and the ones who benefit from the status quo,"" she says. ""So, for any real change in the system, we first need a change in our mindset."" Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7g45g2nxno,'DeepSeek moved me to tears': How young Chinese find therapy in AI,2025-02-12T22:05:50.157Z,Kelly Ng,"Before she goes to bed each night, Holly Wang logs on to DeepSeek for ""therapy sessions"". Ever since January, when the breakout Chinese AI app launched, the 28-year-old has brought her dilemmas and sorrows, including the recent death of her grandmother, to the chatbot. Its responses have resonated so deeply they have at times brought her to tears. ""DeepSeek has been such an amazing counsellor. It has helped me look at things from different perspectives and does a better job than the paid counselling services I have tried,"" says Holly, who asked for her real name to be withheld to protect her privacy. From writing reports and Excel formulas to planning trips, workouts and learning new skills, AI apps have found their way into many people's lives across the world. In China, though, young people like Holly have been looking to AI for something not typically expected of computing and algorithms - emotional support. While the success of DeepSeek has inspired national pride, it also appears to have become a source of comfort for young Chinese like Holly, some of whom are increasingly disillusioned about their future. Experts say the sluggish economy, high unemployment and Covid lockdowns have all played a role in this sentiment, while the Communist Party's tightening grip has also shrunk outlets for people to vent their frustrations. DeepSeek is a generative AI tool - similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini - trained on massive amounts of information to recognise patterns. This allows it to predict things like people's shopping habits, create new content in text and images, and also carry on conversations like a person. The chatbot has struck a chord in China partly because it is far better than other homegrown AI apps, but also because it offers something unique: its AI model, R1, lets users see its ""thought process"" before delivering a response. The first time she used DeepSeek, Holly asked it to write a tribute to her late grandmother. The app took all of five seconds to come up with a response, and it was so beautifully composed, it stunned her. Holly, who lives in Guangzhou, responded: ""You write so well, it makes me feel lost. I feel I'm in an existential crisis."" DeepSeek then sent a cryptically poetic reply: ""Remember that all these words that make you shiver merely echo those that have long existed in your soul. ""I am but the occasional valley you've passed through, that allows you to hear the weight of your own voice.""  Reflecting on this exchange on Chinese social media app RedNote, Holly tells the BBC: ""I don't know why I teared up reading this. Perhaps because it's been a long, long time since I received such comfort in real life. ""I have been so weighed down by distant dreams and the endlessness of work that I have long forgotten my own voice and soul. Thank you, AI."" Rival apps from the West like ChatGPT and Gemini are blocked in China as part of broader restrictions on foreign media and apps. To access them, users in China have to pay for Virtual Private Network (VPN) services. Homegrown alternatives, including models developed by tech giants Alibaba, Baidu and ByteDance paled in comparison - that is, until DeepSeek came along. Holly, who works in the creative industry, rarely uses the other Chinese AI apps, ""as they are not that great"". ""DeepSeek can definitely outperform these apps in generating literary and creative content,"" she says. Nan Jia, who co-authored a paper on AI's potential in offering emotional support, suggests that these chatbots can ""help people feel heard"" in ways fellow humans may not. ""Friends and family may be quick to offer practical solutions or advice when people just want to feel heard and understood. ""AI appears to be better able to empathise than human experts also because they 'hear' everything we share, unlike humans to whom we sometimes ask, 'Are you actually hearing me?'"" adds Nan, who is a business and management professor at the University of Southern California. The demand for mental health services has grown across the world but they remain stigmatised in parts of Asia, experts say. Another woman tells the BBC her experience using other Chinese AI apps ""ended in disappointment"" but that she has been ""amazed"" by DeepSeek. The woman, who lives in Hubei province, had asked the app if she was oversharing her experiences and emotions with family and friends. ""It was my first time seeking counsel from DeepSeek. When I read its thought process, I felt so moved that I cried,"" the woman wrote on RedNote. In reasoning through her query, DeepSeek suggested that the woman's self-perception as an over-sharer might stem from a deep desire for approval. The chatbot gives itself a mental note: ""Response should offer practical advice while being empathetic."" This could include ""affirming the user's sense of self-awareness"". Its eventual response not only provided this affirmation, but also offered her a comprehensive step-by-step framework to help her decide if things needed to be changed. ""DeepSeek has introduced new perspectives that have freed me… I feel it really tries to understand your question and get to know you as a person, before offering a response,"" she says. John, a human resources manager in Shenzhen, told the BBC he appreciated the app's ability to converse ""like a friend or a deep thinker"". ""I've found its responses very helpful and inspiring. For the first time I see AI as my personal sounding board."" Other users claim that Deepseek is able to tell their fortunes - based on some background information fed to it. Many young Chinese have recently turned to psychics and astrology as a way of trying to allay their fears of the future. There is a ""significant shortage"" of professional psychological counselling services in China, and those available are often ""prohibitively expensive"" for most individuals, says Fang Kecheng, a communications professor at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. A number of studies have pointed out that depression and anxiety disorders are growing among Chinese people, and Prof Fang believes the country's economic slowdown, high unemployment and Covid lockdowns have played a role. AI chatbots therefore help to fill the void, he says. Prof Nan stressed, however, that people with serious mental health conditions should not rely on these apps. ""Those who have medical needs, in particular, should be seeking help from trained professionals… Their use of AI will have to be scrutinised very closely,"" she says. But amid all the praise, Deepseek has also raised concerns. Due to the perception of power that China's government wields even over private companies, there are fears - similar to that which sparked the US Congress' crackdown on TikTok - that the Communist Party could lay its hands on the data of foreign users. At least four jurisdictions have now introduced restrictions on DeepSeek, or are considering doing so. South Korea has blocked access to it for military purposes, while Taiwan and Australia have banned it from all government devices. Italy's regulator, which briefly banned ChatGPT in 2023, has done the same with DeepSeek, which has been asked to address concerns over its privacy policy. In the US, two lawmakers are asking for the Chinese app to be banned from government devices. And then there is the tightly controlled online space in which it must operate in China. It is common for social media companies in the country to remove content that is perceived to be threatening to ""social stability"" or overly critical of the Communist Party. As is the case with other popular apps and social media companies like Weibo or WeChat, politically sensitive topics are banned on DeepSeek. When the BBC asked DeepSeek if Taiwan was a sovereign nation, the app initially offered a comprehensive response detailing Taipei's and Beijing's different perspectives, acknowledging that this was a ""complex and politically sensitive issue"". Then it scrubbed all that, declaring: ""Sorry, that's beyond my current scope. Let's talk about something else."" When asked about the 1989 Tiananmen Square massacre when pro-democracy protests were crushed and 200 civilians killed by the military, according to the Chinese government - other estimates range from hundreds to many thousands - DeepSeek again apologised, saying the topic was ""beyond [its] current scope"". Several of the DeepSeek users the BBC was initially in touch with stopped responding when asked if the app's self-censorship was a cause for concern - an indication of how sensitive such discussions can be in China. People have got into trouble with authorities in China because of their online activities. But most of those who responded to the BBC said they had no interest in asking the chatbot difficult political questions. ""I don't really care about political topics… Neither will I ask these questions because my [identifying details] are linked to the app,"" says Yang, a Chinese tech consultant living in London. Holly is accepting of how AI systems in different countries may have to operate differently. ""The developers will have to establish certain boundaries and content moderation policies according to where they are based. Those developed in the US will have their own sets of rules,"" she says. Another DeepSeek user writes of the app: ""Its thought process is beautiful… It is an absolute blessing to people like me. Frankly, I can't care less about the privacy concerns.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cnvqle40183o,"Crackdown on Bangladesh protesters may be crime against humanity, UN says",2025-02-12T14:38:31.561Z,Simon Fraser,"Former Bangladesh prime minister Sheikh Hasina and her government tried to cling on to power using systematic, deadly violence against protesters that could amount to ""crimes against humanity"", the UN has said. UN human rights investigators accused the deposed government of a brutal response to mass opposition last year, in which they said up to 1,400 people had been killed, mostly by security forces. The UN team said ""an official policy to attack and violently repress anti-government protesters"" had been directed by political leaders and senior security officials. Hasina, who had been in office for 15 years, fled by helicopter to India shortly before crowds stormed her residence last August. The unrest began as student-led protests against quotas in civil service jobs and escalated into a countrywide movement to oust Hasina and her Awami League party following a deadly police crackdown. Thousands more were injured in the worst violence Bangladesh has seen since its war of independence in 1971. The UN investigators' findings show the then government, including Sheikh Hasina, ""were aware of and involved in very serious offences"", UN human rights chief Volker Türk told a news conference in Geneva. ""Among our key findings, there are reasonable grounds to believe that officials of the former government, its security and intelligence apparatus, together with violent elements associated with the former ruling party, committed serious and systematic human rights violations,"" Mr Türk said. The UN investigators documented the shooting at point-blank range of some protesters, the deliberate maiming of others, arbitrary arrests and torture. Children, too, were targeted – the report estimates up to 13% of the 1,400 people killed between between 1 July and 15 August were children. ""The brutal response was a calculated and well-co-ordinated strategy by the former government to hold onto power in the face of mass opposition,"" Mr Türk said. He said the evidence gathered by his office painted ""a disturbing picture of rampant state violence and targeted killings"". ""There are reasonable grounds to believe hundreds of extrajudicial killings, extensive arbitrary arrests and detentions, and torture, were carried out with the knowledge, co-ordination and direction of the political leadership and senior security officials as part of a strategy to suppress the protests."" The report was requested by Bangladesh's caretaker leader, Muhammad Yunus, who said he and his interim government remained ""committed to transforming Bangladesh into a country in which all its people can live in security and dignity"". The overall number of deaths given by the UN team is far higher than the 834 most recently estimated by his government. The UN team that compiled the report included human rights investigators, a forensics physician and a weapons expert. Their findings are mainly based on more than 230 interviews with survivors, witnesses and others. They were given access to medical case files, photos, videos and other material. ""Former senior officials directly involved in handling the protests and other inside sources described how the former prime minister and other senior officials directed and oversaw a series of large-scale operations, in which security and intelligence forces shot and killed protesters or arbitrarily arrested and tortured them,"" the report said. It ""found patterns of security forces deliberately and impermissibly killing or maiming protesters, including incidents where people were shot at point-blank range"". Mohammad Ali Arafat, a former minister in Sheikh Hasina's cabinet tasked wth negotiating with demonstrators, rejected the report's findings, saying it was ""preposterous"" to suggest she had ordered protest leaders to be killed. ""The problem with relying on 'testimonies' from unnamed security officials at this time is their utter unreliability,"" he told the BBC. ""These security officials, who themselves are in the dock for the alleged rights violations, would naturally point fingers at whoever the current government in Bangladesh wants to implicate. ""The UN would be mistaken to rely on such 'cut-throat' defences."" While the report attributes most of the violence to government security forces, it also raises concerns about attacks on those perceived to be supporters of the former government, and against some religious and ethnic groups. These must be investigated too, the UN Human Rights Office said. Additional reporting by Ethirajan Anbarasan"

Drone images suggest that a human body is inside the cabin, but it is unclear if it is that of the truck's missing 74-year-old driver. The sinkhole, which now measures 40m (131ft) in diameter, opened at a road intersection in Yashio city near Tokyo. It is believed to be caused by a sewer rupture. Search teams are unable to enter the 5m-wide pipe due to continuous water flow and high levels of hydrogen sulfide or sewer gas, officials said. They will need to install a temporary bypass pipe to stop the water flow and access the truck. That process could take three months, Saitama Governor Motohiro Ono said. While rescuers were able to pull the truck's loading platform from the sinkhole, they were unable to reach the cabin which had the driver. The driver was able to communicate with rescuers shortly after he fell into the sinkhole on 28 January, but contact was lost as the truck was buried deeper in soil and debris. On Sunday, authorities moved their search from the sinkhole to the nearby sewer pipe, where part of a driver's seat was found. The sinkhole initially measured 10m wide and 5m deep, but it has since quadrupled in size after it merged with another sinkhole nearby. As the crater continues to erode, authorities have asked nearby residents to evacuate their homes, fearing further cave-ins. Officials have also asked 1.2 million residents in Saitama prefecture to reduce their water usage, including cutting back on showers and laundry, to limit the water flowing in the underground pipes. The water flow and further road collapses have hampered the search operation, which was suspended more than once out of safety concerns. Sinkholes are increasingly common in Japanese cities, as many have ageing sewage pipeline infrastructure. Officials say that it could take two or three years to repair the sewer rupture."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ceve1xpdjxro,'Ineffective' generic drugs fuel rare public anger in China,2025-02-11T22:49:48.223Z,Koh Ewe,"Public anger in China over concerns raised by doctors that generic drugs used in public hospitals are increasingly ineffective has led to a rare response from the government. Doctors say they believe the country's drug procurement system, which incentivises the use of cheap generic drugs over original brand-name pharmaceuticals, has led to costs being cut at the expense of people's safety. But officials, quoted by multiple state media outlets on Sunday, say the issue is one of perception rather than reality. One report said different people simply had different reactions to medicines and that claims about them being ineffective had ""mostly come from people's anecdotes and subjective feelings"". The official response has done little to allay public fears over the reputation of drugs in public hospitals and pharmacies. It is the latest challenge to a healthcare system that is already under enormous strain because of a rapidly ageing population. The debate surrounding the use of generic drugs began in December, when authorities announced the list of nearly 200 companies that had won contracts to sell medicines to Chinese state hospitals. Almost all were domestic makers of generic pharmaceuticals. This intensified in January, when, in a video interview that went viral, the director of a hospital department in Shanghai, shared his concerns about the drug procurement system. Zheng Minhua cited ""antibiotics that cause allergies, blood pressure that won't go down, anaesthetised patients who won't sleep"" and laxatives that did not clear the bowel as being among the issues that had been encountered. Dr Zheng's words immediately struck a chord and have been condensed into a social media slogan that has been viewed by millions in the past month - though much of the discussion of the topic has since been censored on Weibo. Many people have come forward to share their own bad experiences with alleged substandard drugs. ""I underwent intestinal surgeries in 2024, which required me to consume laxatives beforehand,"" one Weibo user wrote. They said the drugs they were given had ""no effect whatsoever"", even after the dose was doubled, and that they had to turn to drinking coffee to help clear their bowel. The concerns raised over the efficacy of generic drugs has caused distrust and made some people unwilling to use them. A person on Xiaohongshu, China's Instagram-like app, said that when hospital doctors prescribed them the generic version of an antibiotic, they immediately went online to buy the ""original"" ""real"" one, since the generic version ""tasted different"". ""There have been many people catching colds recently. A lot of them might have bought this drug. Quickly send reminders to your friends now and get them to check the brand before buying,"" the user warned. Some of the most popular posts discussing the procurement controversy have been taken down, though it is unclear by whom. China's heavily monitored internet has a strong culture of censorship by both authorities and users themselves. In a scathing, now-removed post by popular podcast host Meng Chang, he lambasted the lack of imported drugs in the public sector: ""If this isn't a bottom line, I don't know what is."" Public anger has also been focussed on the difficulties of accessing imported drugs that people believe to be of better quality. In response to authorities' attempt to reassure people of the quality of generic drugs, one Weibo user wrote: ""As long as we are allowed to buy brand-name drugs ourselves, I have no other complaints."" It was introduced in 2018 as a way to lower state expenditure on medicines and involves local governments putting out tender processes for around 70% of state hospitals' annual drug requirements. Various drug manufacturers then compete to offer the lowest prices for drugs to win these lucrative contracts. This gives an advantage to domestically-produced generic drugs, which contain the same active pharmaceutical ingredients as original patented drugs but are often several times cheaper to make as they do not include the high costs of research and development. China has emerged as one of the world's largest players in the global generic pharmaceutical market, exporting both finished products to consumers abroad and key ingredients to foreign companies. At home, thousands of generic drug manufacturers compete to sell their products at competitive prices in the expanding domestic market. For generic medicines to be eligible for China's procurement process, they have to be tested and determined to be similar enough to the brand-name version of the drug. Beijing has credited the drugs procurement system with saving millions of residents more than $50bn (£40bn) in its first five years. But the procurement process has seen some drug manufacturers offer medicines at incredibly low prices. One of the winning bids last December was an aspirin tablet selling for less than one cent. ""Are drug tablets that cost less than one cent edible?"" became a trending topic on Weibo at the time. ""The manufacturers that win the bids often set prices so low that they may struggle to produce high quality drugs with the correct ingredients, potentially leading to ineffective medications,"" Stacy Zhang, associate professor at NYU Langone Health, told the BBC. She added that while the procurement system ""was not designed to restrict access to imported brand-name drugs"", it may still have ""affected their accessibility"". A proposal submitted by 20 doctors, including Dr Zheng, to Shanghai authorities last month stated that ""there are widespread concerns in the industry that procurement prices are too low, prompting unethical companies to cut corners to reduce costs, affecting the efficacy of drugs"". ""Doctors are helpless because they have no choice, and there is no channel to escalate feedback."" A recent article by Xia Zhimin, a doctor in Hangzhou, has added to the scrutiny. In it, he highlighted what he said was questionable data from the trials of generic drugs on the procurement list - it was identical to the data from the original drug on which it was based. Dr Xia suggested that it could be evidence of fraud. The National Medical Products Administration responded by saying his findings were due to an ""editorial error"". His article has since been removed. Adding to quality concerns are counterfeit drugs, which have seeped into both generic and brand-name drugs markets across the world and are notoriously difficult to detect. The World Health Organization has described this a global health problem. ""To enhance affordability, the introduction of cost-effective generics is essential,"" Kevin Lu, associate professor at the University of South Carolina's College of Pharmacy, told the BBC. He added that the procurement process needed ""strengthened quality control"" and ""continued improvements in drug approval and manufacturing standards"". The controversy comes at a time when China's healthcare system is already under mounting pressure. A rapidly ageing population has meant that the country's total health expenditure has increased nearly 20-fold over the last 20 years, reaching 9 trillion yuan ($1.25 trillion; £1 trillion) in 2023. Across the country, public medical insurance funds are running thin. Deficits have already appeared in some provinces, where local governments that had relied heavily on land sales for revenue are now struggling with debt as a real estate crisis engulfs China's economy. At the same time, the healthcare system has been experiencing a trust crisis. Violent attacks against medical staff have risen since the 2000s, fuelled by anger at the lack of resources and an erosion of faith in doctors. Unlike issues that have been deemed politically sensitive and heavily censored by authorities, such as the persecution of political dissidents or the suppression of the Uyghurs in Xinjiang, the ongoing controversy surrounding the procurement of drugs has at least been acknowledged by the state as a problem to be tackled. The National Healthcare Security Administration said in a statement on 19 January that authorities ""attached great importance"" to these safety concerns and would seek feedback on the drug procurement policy. ""It is undeniable that the national centralised procurement is still in its infancy. There are many pharmaceutical companies with varying production quality,"" state media Life Times quoted a public health scholar as saying. Other experts cited in the article called for drug evaluation standards to be improved. As authorities try to remedy the procurement system's faltering image, all the scrutiny is now overshadowing a system designed to be a win-win: saving lives and also saving money. As one Weibo user argued, the savings from lower drug prices are but ""a drop in a bucket"" of China's national healthcare costs. On the other hand, they wrote, allowing potentially defective drugs to be widely used is akin to ""drinking poison to quench thirst""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gwjy18v4go,Teacher fatally stabs eight-year-old in South Korea,2025-02-11T16:01:05.955Z,Koh Ewe,"A teacher has fatally stabbed an eight-year-old girl at an elementary school in South Korea, in an incident that has shocked the nation. The female teacher, who is in her 40s, confessed to stabbing the student in the central city of Daejeon, police said. The girl was found with stab wounds on the second floor of a school building at 18:00 local time (09:00 GMT) on Monday and was pronounced dead at hospital. The teacher was found beside her with stab wounds that police said may have been self-inflicted. South Korea's acting president Choi Sang-mok ordered an investigation into the case on Tuesday and urged authorities to ""implement necessary measures to ensure such incidents never happen again"". Some locals laid flowers and a stuffed doll at the gate of the school, which was closed on Tuesday. In a police briefing, Yook Jong-myung, head of the Dajeon Western Police Station, said the teacher was currently recovering in hospital, adding that she had a wound on her neck that had been stitched. The Daejeon education office earlier said the teacher had requested a six-month leave of absence citing depression on 9 December, but had returned to school just 20 days later after a doctor assessed her as being fit to work. During her time off she had suicidal thoughts, Mr Yook said, citing testimony the teacher had provided to police. Days before the stabbing, the teacher had displayed violent behaviour, including putting another teacher in a headlock, the education office said. Two officials from the education office had visited the school on Monday - the morning of the stabbing - to investigate that earlier altercation. After the attack on the co-worker, the education office recommended that the teacher be put on leave and be separated physically from the other teacher. She was made to sit beside the vice principal's desk so that she could be kept under close watch. She had also not been teaching any classes since her leave in December, and did not have any contact with the eight-year-old student, the official said. According to the testimony given by the teacher to police, she was ""annoyed"" that she had not been able to return to teaching a class. She told them she had purchased a weapon on the day of the attack and brought it to school - adding that she had planned to kill herself along with a child. The testimony went on to say that the teacher did not care which child it was, and targeted the last to leave. She managed to ""lure the child into the media room"" before attacking them, it said. The student was reported missing on Monday evening, after a bus driver informed the school that she had not arrived to be picked up that day. South Korea is a generally safe country with strict gun control laws. But in recent years, it has grappled with several high-profile crimes, including stabbings. ""It pains me to see such incidents because a school should be our safest space,"" said acting President Choi. ""I offer my deep condolences to the victim's family who suffered great shock and agony."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8y2877051o,Salvador Dalí art comes to India for the first time,2025-02-11T13:58:19.135Z,Cherylann Mollan,"Although the Spanish surrealist Salvador Dalí never visited India, an exhibition of his artworks is being held in the country for the first time. Starting Friday, an exhibition in the capital Delhi will showcase an expansive collection of more than 200 of his original sketches, etchings and watercolour paintings. The collection has been curated by Christine Argillet, daughter of Pierre Argillet, a French collector who was also Dalí's friend and publisher. ""Dalí was fascinated by India, especially the West's fascination with Indian mysticism in the 1960s and 1970s,"" Ms Argillet told the BBC. Some of the sketches in the collection are based on photographs her father had taken during a trip to India in the 1970s, when the hippie movement was at its peak and young guitar-toting Americans visited India on spiritual quests. Dalí's India features elephants and temples but, as with all his artwork, they're not always easy to spot, having been rendered in the artist's trademark surrealist style. In his works, human bodies sprout flowers from their heads; eyeballs dance in a matrix of squiggles and strokes and dismembered body parts interact animatedly with the world around them. Stare for longer than a minute and these disconnected shapes begin to form new connections and meanings in the mind's eye. ""Appreciating Dalí's art is like peeling back the layers of an onion; you can keep finding something new to marvel at,"" Ms Argillet says. Bringing Dalí's work to India was a long and arduous endeavour, says Akshitta Aggarwal of Bruno Art Group, the international art gallery presenting the exhibition. ""The project took five years; every sketch and artwork had to be checked for its authenticity,"" Ms Aggarwal says. Strictly speaking, this isn't the first time Dalí's creations have come to India. The Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata city holds two colour etchings of the artist. In 1967, Dalí famously designed a set of whimsical ashtrays for Air India - the country's national airline back then - which were handed out to first class passengers. In return, Dalí demanded not money but a baby elephant. Uttara Parikh, the then deputy commercial director of Air India, recounted to Times of India newspaper how she initially went shopping for one in a zoo in Mumbai city but returned empty-handed. She finally procured the baby elephant from a zoo in Bangalore city (now Bengaluru) and Air India flew the animal to Spain, where it was kept in a zoo until its death in 2018. (Dalí had exciting plans for the elephant, such as undertaking a journey across the Alps, but his wife dissuaded him from attempting to carry them out). Dalí's demand might seem outrageous, but those familiar with the artist and his legacy know that it was very much in keeping with his personality. Born in Spain in 1904, Dalí grew up in a world that was embracing the avant-garde and responding to the fallout of two world wars. Creatives of his time, like Pablo Picasso, Joan Miró and André Breton, were finding new ways to express themselves and their ideas and their artistic styles heavily influenced a young Dalí. The surrealist movement, widely acknowledged to be founded by André Breton, resonated with him the most. Surrealist art advocated for a form of expression that was ""dictated by thought, in the absence of any control exercised by reason"", according to Breton. Dalí was also heavily inspired by Sigmund Freud and his theories around psychoanalysis - a method of treating mental illnesses by focussing on conflicts originating in a person's psyche. Dreams take on a special importance as they are believed to express a person's repressed thoughts and urges. Consequently, Dalí's art reflects many of these ideas - they have an almost dream-like quality and through free association, the visuals take on meanings that are unique to the onlooker. There is also visceral, almost shocking imagery, much like forbidden desires lying hidden in the subconscious mind. ""Dalí was a free-thinker and he embraced all facets of the human condition, particularly the taboo and unsettling ones,"" Ms Argillet says. The artist's outward persona reflected his colourful take on life. He dressed in flamboyant suits and sported a moustache that pointed upward so severely it seemed in danger of piercing his eyes. In a 1955 interview with the BBC, Dalí revealed the origins of his famous upturned moustache. ""Dates, you know the fruit? In the last moment of dinner, I [did] not clean my finger and I put a little in my moustache and it remains for all afternoon very efficiently,"" he said but later revealed that he used a strong wax to shape his moustache. In the same interview, he described his moustache as being ""very gay, very pointed, very aggressive"". Ms Argillet, who knew Dalí intimately through her childhood and teenage years and often spent her summers in Spain with her father, recollects Dalí being a humorous person who loved playing pranks and ""shocking the bourgeois"". He once encouraged her to take some sweets from his bedroom and throw them at fishermen at a nearby beach. Only the sweets turned out to be cherry bombs, annoying the fishermen and forcing a young Ms Argillet to run for cover. ""At one of his parties, he had a tortoise carry around an ashtray on its shell,"" Ms Argillet says. But she adds that he was also a shy, intuitive, observant person who had a knack for reading people's minds. He painted in his studio in short pants and slippers and, according to Ms Argillet, it was Dalí's shyness that made him over-perform in public. ""He was misunderstood by many. There were many layers to Dalí, just like his paintings,"" Ms Argillet says. ""The closer you look at his paintings, the more you understand Dalí."" The exhibition 'Dali comes to India' will be held at the India Habitat Centre from 7 February to 13 February and at Masarrat Gallery by Bruno Art Group from 15 February to 16 March. This article has been updated to reflect that two Dali colour etchings are at Victoria Memorial Hall in Kolkata city."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwx9942x72o,"India sees huge spike in hate speech in 2024, says report",2025-02-11T11:56:46.344Z,"Meryl Sebastian, BBC News, Kochi","Instances of hate speech against minorities jumped 74% in India in 2024, peaking during the country's national elections, according to a new report. The report, released on Monday by Washington-based research group India Hate Lab, documented 1,165 such instances last year, adding that politicians like Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Home Minister Amit Shah were among the most frequent purveyors of hate speech. Muslims were targeted the most, with 98.5% of recorded instances of hate speech directed against them. The report said most of the events where hate speech occurred were held in states governed by Modi's party or larger alliance. The BBC has sought comment on the India Hate Lab report from several spokespersons at Modi's Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). Over the years, BJP leaders have often been accused of targeting India's minority communities, especially Muslims. The ruling party has rejected allegations of Islamophobia and hate speech levelled at it by rights groups and opposition leaders. On Tuesday, its national spokesperson reiterated this stance, telling CNN that the country had a ""very strong legal system which is structured to maintain peace, order and ensure non-violence at any cost"". ""Today's India does not need any certification from any 'anti-India reports industry' which is run by vested interests to prejudice and dent India's image,"" Jaiveer Shergill said. But the party was accused of using hate speech during the heated election campaign last year. The prime minister himself was accused of using divisive rhetoric that attacked Muslims. In May, India's Election Commission also asked the party to remove a social media post that opposition leaders said ""demonised Muslims"". According to the India Hate Lab report, 269 hate speech instances were reported in May 2024, the highest in the year. Christians have also been targeted by hate speech, but to a lesser extent than Muslims, the report says. Rights groups have often said that minorities, especially Muslims, have faced increased discrimination and attacks after Modi's government came to power in 2014. The BJP has repeatedly denied these allegations. The lab's report said that hate speech was especially observed at political rallies, religious processions, protest marches and cultural gatherings. Most of these events - 931 or 79.9% - took place in states where the BJP directly governed or ruled in coalition. Three BJP-ruled states - Uttar Pradesh, Maharashtra and Madhya Pradesh - accounted for nearly half of the total hate speech events recorded in 2024, the lab's data showed. The ruling party was also the organiser for 340 such events in 2024, a 580% increase from the previous year. ""Hate speech patterns in 2024 also revealed a deeply alarming surge in dangerous speech compared to 2023, with both political leaders and religious figures openly inciting violence against Muslims,"" the report said. ""This included calls for outright violence, calls to arms, the economic boycott of Muslim businesses, the destruction of Muslim residential properties and the seizing or demolition of Muslim religious structures."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9e78k7n01o,Japan ministry worker loses sensitive files on night out,2025-02-11T07:49:02.994Z,Joel Guinto,"A Japanese finance ministry employee on a night out with colleagues lost documents containing the personal data of 187 people suspected of drug smuggling, local media say. The employee, who has not been named, reportedly drank nine glasses of beer during a five-hour-long night out with co-workers in Yokohama, south of the capital Tokyo, on 6 February. Local media said that he did not realise he had lost his bag until after he got off his train ride home in Sumida, another city near central Tokyo. The finance ministry has said it was ""deeply sorry"" for the incident that ""significantly undermined public trust"", according to public broadcaster NHK. The bag had contained documents which had the names and addresses of 187 suspected drug smugglers and recipients of marijuana seeds, the ministry said. It had also contained business laptops with the employee's personal data. The employee, who is assigned to the customs and tariff bureau, was not named in the NHK report. The BBC has reached out to the finance ministry for comment on Tuesday, a public holiday in Japan. Alcohol has long been seen as a social lubricant for thousands of years in Japan, where business deals and difficult issues are discussed over bottles of beer and sake. It is believed that drinking alcohol creates a more relaxed environment for such discussions."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99vxpg55zmo,How a North Korean went from begging to K-pop,2025-02-10T22:14:43.574Z,Yuna Ku,"Yu Hyuk was just nine years old when he started begging on the streets of North Hamgyong, one of the poorest provinces in North Korea, nestled along the northern border with China and Russia. Besides begging, he ran errands for soldiers and sold foraged mushrooms. Sometimes he stole food out of sheer hunger: once he snatched a lunchbox that sat unattended at an underground station. Inside was a scoop of spoiled rice. This was just ""part of everyday life"" for many North Koreans, he says, adding that his own life was so consumed with survival that it left little room for dreams. But dream he did. Later on this year, the 25-year-old will debut in the US as a member of a K-pop boy band. 1Verse (pronounced ""universe"") is made up of five members: Hyuk, Seok who is also from North Korea, Aito from Japan, and Asian Americans Kenny and Nathan - all prefer to go by their first names. They are set to make history as the first K-pop boy band to debut with North Korean defectors. Hyuk was born in a seaside village in Kyongsong county and raised by his father and grandmother, after his parents broke up when he was just four. Later, his mother fled the North to settle in the South and reached out to him in an attempt to get him to join her. But he refused as he was close to his father and did not want to leave him. Hyuk says his family was ""not extremely poor"" to begin with, but the situation quickly deteriorated after his parents separated. His father didn't want to work and his grandmother was too old, so Hyuk was left to his own devices to survive. Eventually, his father persuaded him to join his mother, and in 2013 Hyuk escaped from North Korea. It took months for him to arrive in the South, after going through several countries. He has chosen not to reveal specifics of the route, as he fears putting other future defectors at risk. Once in the South, he lived with his mother for just a year, before moving to a boarding school with his mum's financial support. However, he struggled to cope with South Korea’s fiercely competitive education system, as Hyuk had barely finished primary school before his defection. Writing was the one thing he found solace in, he says. He started with short poems alluding to his past life in North Korea. “I couldn’t openly share what I’d been through, but I still wanted to make a record of it.” At first, Hyuk believed his story couldn’t be understood by others, but was encouraged by friends and teachers in his school's music club - and eventually found his passion in rap. Growing up, music had been a luxury, let alone K-pop which was something he had barely heard of. But now, he channelled his thoughts of feeling lonely and of missing his father into music, referring to himself as “the loneliest of the loners” - a line in Ordinary Person, a rap song he composed as a part of a pre-debut project. Hyuk graduated from high school aged 20. Afterwards, he worked part-time at restaurants and factories to support himself. But it was in 2018 when he was featured in an educational TV programme that his luck changed. His unique background and rapping talent caught the eye of music producer Michelle Cho, who was formerly from SM Entertainment, the agency behind some of K-pop's biggest acts. She offered him a spot in her agency, Singing Beetle. ""I didn't trust Michelle for about a year because I thought she was cheating me,"" Hyuk says, adding that defectors are often targeted by scams in the South. But gradually he realised that Ms Cho was ""investing way too much time and money"" for it to be anything but genuine. Kim Seok, 24, also defected and arrived in the South in 2019, though his experience was vastly different to that of Seok's. Coming from a relatively better-off family, Seok lived close to the border with China and had access to K-pop and K-drama through smuggled USBs and SD cards. Due to safety reasons, we are unable to reveal much more about his life in the North and how he came to the South. Both boys were described by Ms Cho as ""blank canvases"", adding that she had never encountered trainees quite like them. Unlike Aito and Kenny, who had been immersed in music and dance from an early age, Hyuk and Seok were complete beginners. “They had absolutely no grasp of pop culture,"" she said. But their ability to “endure physical challenges” astonished Ms Cho. They pushed through gruelling hours of dance practice with such determination that she was worried they were “overdoing it”. Apart from music and dance lessons, their training also covered etiquette and engaging in discussions, to prepare them for media interviews. “I don’t think they were used to questioning things or expressing their opinion,” says Ms Cho. “At first, when a trainer asked the reasoning behind their thoughts, the only response was, ‘Because you said so last time'.” But after more than three years, Hyuk has made remarkable progress, she says. ""Now, Hyuk questions many things. For example, if I ask him to do something, he'll reply 'Why? Why is it necessary?' Sometimes, I regret what I've done,"" says Ms Cho chuckling. But what do the other two boys think of their bandmates? “I was kind of afraid at first because North Korea has a hostile relationship with Japan. I thought North Koreans would be scary, but that turned out not to be true,” says Aito, who at 20 is the youngest of the four. Kenny, who spent much of his life in the US, adds that there were also small cultural differences that have taken him time to get used to. ""Korean culture is very [communal] in that you eat together... that was a culture shock [to me]"", he said. ""I usually don't like eating with people, I prefer Netflix in my ear. But their joy comes from being collective."" Late last year, the band added a fifth member, Nathan, an American of mixed Laotian and Thai heritage to the group. They aim to debut in the US later this year - a decision that the label hopes could attract more American fans. Dozens of K-pop groups make their debut each year and only a few, typically those managed by major labels, become popular. So it's still too early to say if 1Verse will go on to resonate with audiences. But Hyuk has big dreams, hoping that it might be possible one day for his fellow North Koreans to listen to his songs. With human rights activists often sending leaflets and USBs containing K-culture content via balloons and bottles towards the North, this may prove to be less of a pipe dream than it sounds, though Hyuk also has his worries. To avoid being seen as a vocal critic of North Korea, he refers to his homeland as “the upper side” in interviews and avoids mentioning North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. Kim has in recent years been ratcheting up his crackdown on the inflow of K-culture. Since 2020, the consumption and distribution of such content has become a crime punishable by death. A rare video obtained by BBC Korean last year, believed to be filmed in 2022, shows two teenage boys publicly sentenced to 12 years of hard labour for watching and distributing K-dramas. One academic says it would cause a ""stir"" in North Korea should 1Verse's music become a hit. ""If a North Korean defector openly embraced their identity and went on to become a world-class activist, I think that would cause a stir in the North,"" said Ha Seung-hee, an academic specialising in music and media at Dongguk University's Institute of North Korean Studies. But his main motivation, Hyuk says, is to prove that defectors can be a success. “Many defectors see an insurmountable gap between themselves and K-pop idols. It is hardly a career option for us,"" said Hyuk. “So if I succeed, other defectors might be encouraged [to] have even bigger dreams. That’s why I am trying my hardest.”"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3vew1ejgo,New Zealand and Cook Islands fall out over China deal,2025-02-10T15:38:01.845Z,Kathryn Armstrong,"New Zealand has accused the Cook Islands government of a lack of transparency over its plans to strike a partnership deal with China. The tiny Pacific Island nation's leader, Mark Brown, is this week making his country's first ever state visit to Beijing in order to sign the agreement. However, New Zealand says it was not properly consulted over the plans, leading to what Prime Minister Christopher Luxon has described as a ""dispute"". The Cook Islands is hugely reliant on New Zealand under a longstanding ""free association"" agreement that provides it with defence and financial support. China's growing influence in the Pacific has challenged the US and its allies, who have held sway for years. ""We value our partnership with New Zealand and we expect the same respect,"" Brown said at a press conference last week. He was due to travel to China on Monday. ""Disagreements, although difficult, are an inevitable part of international relations but they should never define the entirety of our engagement."" He has denied any dispute, saying ""engagement has been consistent, respectful and open"" and that the Cook Islands has the right to forge its own path as a self-governing country. China's foreign ministry said that both countries were important partners and that it was ready to work with the Cook Islands to ""achieve new progress"". ""The China-Cook Islands relationship is not targeted at any third party and should not be subject to or be disrupted by any third party,"" said spokesman Guo Jiakun. Beijing has had diplomatic ties with the Cook Islands since 1997 and is one of its development partners. Under their 60-year-old agreement, the Cook Islands is self governing in ""free association"" with New Zealand. The two countries are expected to consult each other over issues of defence and security. Brown says the new agreement with China will cover areas including infrastructure, trade and tourism. Deep deep-sea mining is also expected to be part of the deal. Brown believes that mining valuable minerals on the seabed could be a game-changer for the Cook Islands, creating huge economic wealth. However, the practice, in which China is a major player, is controversial, and critics believe it will exacerbate climate change - to which the Cook Islands are already vulnerable. Luxon said on Monday that while New Zealand had ""very good relations between the Cook Islands and its people"", in this case there had not been transparency. Asked at a press conference whether he would consider putting aid to the Cook Islands on hold, as it recently did for Kiribati due to a diplomatic snub, Luxon said he would wait to see what was in the deal. Under the free association agreement Cook Islanders can live, work and access healthcare as New Zealand citizens - benefits some fear they could lose if relations between the two countries further sour. There has also been criticism from some that Brown and his government did not consult the public about the China deal first - something Tina Browne, the leader of the Democratic Party, has described as ""insane"". Both she and fellow opposition leader Teariki Heather, from the Cook Islands United Party, say they have lost confidence in Brown's leadership. That is despite his recent U-turn on a controversial proposal to introduce a separate passport for Cook Island citizens, while also allowing them to retain New Zealand citizenship. Wellington rejected the plan last year. The Cook Islands is not the first Pacific Island nation to strengthen its ties with China. The Solomon Islands signed a security pact with Beijing in 2022, while countries including Vanuatu and Papua New Guinea also have close relations."

Power is gradually being restored across the island nation of 22 million people, with medical facilities and water purification plants being given priority. ""A monkey has come in contact with our grid transformer, causing an imbalance in the system,"" Energy Minister Kumara Jayakody told reporters. The blackout started at about 11:00 local time (05:30 GMT) on Sunday, forcing many to rely on generators. Officials said it may take a few hours to get power back. On social media, people criticised the authorities while making fun of the incident. ""A rogue monkey knocked out Sri Lanka's entire power grid after triggering a total failure at a substation in Colombo,"" X user Mario Nawfal wrote. ""One monkey = total chaos. Time to rethink infrastructure?"" he added. Another X user, Sreeni R, posted an illustration of the monkey god Hanuman, who according to the Hindu epic Ramayana, set Sri Lanka on fire during a war with the demon king Ravana who ruled the country. ""Sri Lanka tasted monkey business in the past,"" he wrote. ""Only in Sri Lanka can a group of monkeys fighting inside a power station cause an islandwide power outage,"" wrote Jamila Husain, editor-in-chief of local newspaper Daily Mirror. In a report published on Monday, the newspaper said engineers have been warning consecutive governments ""for years"" to upgrade its power grid or face frequent blackouts. ""The national power grid is in such a weakened state that frequent islandwide power outages maybe expected if there is a disturbance even in one of our lines,"" it quoted an unnamed senior engineer saying. Sri Lanka experienced widespread blackouts during its economic crisis in 2022."

Ne Zha 2, based on a Chinese mythological character, has raked in more than 8 billion yuan ($1.1bn; £910m) during the week-long Lunar New Year holiday, according to ticket sales tracker Maoyan. It broke the record set by 2021's The Battle of Lake Changjin, a propaganda film about the 1950s Korean War, which earned about $900m. Ne Zha 2 is being hailed as a symbol of progress in Chinese film, which has long trailed Hollywood despite a massive domestic market. Hot off its domestic success, Ne Zha 2 will be shown overseas next week, including in the US, Canada and Australia. To Chinese viewers, Ne Zha 2 shows how locally-made films are becoming competitive globally. ""It not only showcases the strong power of Chinese animation after its rise, but also demonstrates the infinite possibilities of traditional Chinese mythology in the modern context,"" reads one review on IMDB. Some hope it could earn another $1bn and surpass the world's highest-grossing film of all time, 2009's Avatar. ""Now it's over to the Chinese people overseas to chip in,"" read one comment on Weibo. Movie ticket sales in China surge during the Lunar New Year festivities. This season saw Chinese films rake in $1.3b during the weeklong holiday period, underscoring an increase in consumer spending that Chinese authorities have been hoping for. Aside from setting a new box-office benchmark in China, Ne Zha 2 is also the first movie ever to cross $1bn in a single market, according to Hollywood publication Deadline. Ne Zha 2 has been praised for its script and visual effects. Figurines of the movie's characters have flown off the shelves as fans flock to cinemas. It builds on the success of the 2019 film Ne Zha, which made more than $725m and is China's fifth highest-grossing film of all time."

Two Indian commandos were also killed in the battle, and two other security force members were wounded, police said. Chhattisgarh has seen a long-running insurgency by Maoists who say they are fighting for the rights of the poor. Sunday's clashes were among the deadliest clashes since the government ramped up efforts to crush the insurgency, which has been running since the 1960s. ""So far 31 dead bodies of the Maoists have been recovered,"" senior police officer Sundarraj Pattilingam said. The death toll could rise as police carry out operations in the area, he said. Police said they had seized assault rifles and grenade launchers from the bodies of the dead rebels. The clashes took place in the forests of Bijapur district in Chhattisgarh. Amit Shah, India's interior minister, who says the government expects to crush the rebellion by 2026, said the operation had been a ""big success"". The rebels are inspired by the Chinese revolutionary leader Mao Zedong. They claim to be fighting for communist rule and greater rights for tribal people and the rural poor. The insurgency began in West Bengal state in the late 1960s and has since spread to more than a third of India's 600 districts. The rebels control large areas of several states in a ""red corridor"" stretching from north-east to central India. Major military and police offensives in recent years have pushed the rebels back to their forest strongholds and levels of violence have fallen. But clashes between security forces and rebels are still common, killing scores of people every year. A crackdown by security forces killed around 287 rebels last year - the vast majority in Chhattisgarh - according to government data. More than 10,000 people are believed to have died since the 1960s."

The landslide struck Jinping village in Sichuan province at 11:50 on Saturday (03:50 GMT) burying 10 houses and trapping several residents. Two people were rescued. A command centre has been set up at the scene according to a statement by the county's emergency management bureau. China's President Xi Jinping has ordered an ""all-out"" rescue of those trapped. Images from state media show a huge collapse of mud and rock from a steep mountainside, cutting through what appears to be a small village. Hundreds of emergency workers are searching for survivors, according to a statement from China's Ministry of Emergency Management. Around 200 people have been evacuated. President Xi has ordered authorities to do ""everything possible to search and rescue missing people, minimise casualties and properly handle the aftermath"", according to the official Xinhua state news agency. Chinese Premier Li Qiang additionally asked for an investigation into potential geological hazard risks in nearby areas. According to local media reports, villagers have said large rocks had been frequently seen rolling down the mountain over the last six months. Li also said residents who were under threat should be evacuated to prevent another disaster, the AP news agency reports, citing Xinhua. Fifty million yuan ($6.9m; £5.5m) has been allocated from central government funds to repair infrastructure and public services, AP adds. The remote, mountainous parts of China's south-west can be prone to landslides. In January 2024, a landslide in China's Yunnan province killed dozens of people when a steep cliff collapsed and destroyed part of a village. At least 18 people were killed in a separate landslide in the same region 11 years earlier."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8edg6n5xp3o,Frozen in time: Rare early images of the Himalayas from Italian pioneer,2025-02-09T03:20:05.516Z,Sudha G Tilak,"Vittorio Sella was a pioneering Italian photographer whose work at the turn of the 20th Century shaped both mountain photography and mountaineering history. His rare images of the Himalayas remain some of the most iconic ever captured. A new ongoing show in the Indian capital, Delhi, called Vittorio Sella: Photographer in the Himalaya brings to life the breathtaking grandeur of the Himalayas through his lens. Curated by renowned British explorer and author Hugh Thomson and organised by Delhi Art Gallery (DAG), the show is likely one of the largest collection of Sella's Indian views. It features some of the earliest high-altitude photographs of Kanchenjunga, the world's third-highest mountain, and K2, the world's second-tallest mountain, captured over a century ago. Born in Biella, a town known for its wool trade in northern Italy, Sella (1859–1943) made his first ascents in the nearby Alps. ""Throughout his career Sella made use of his skills in engineering and chemistry that the wool mills and his father had taught him,"" says Thomson. By his twenties, he had mastered complex photographic techniques like the collodion process, enabling him to develop large-format glass plates under harsh conditions. His panoramic images, crafted with technical perfection, earned worldwide acclaim. Sella's Himalayan journey began in 1899 when he joined British explorer Douglas Freshfield on an expedition circumnavigating Kanchenjunga. Any circumnavigation of the mountain also involved an incursion into Nepal, which was also a closed kingdom. While the team's climbing ambitions were thwarted by relentless rain, Sella seized the opportunity to capture pristine snow-dusted peaks. He experimented restlessly with technology, trying out telephoto pictures of Kanchenjunga. His images transported viewers to a world untouched by time. A decade later, Sella reached new heights - both literally and artistically - on a 1909 expedition to K2 with the Duke of the Abruzzi. His photographs of the world's most difficult mountain stand as a testament to his skill and resilience. Carrying a camera system weighing nearly 30kg, Sella crisscrossed treacherous landscapes, creating images that defined mountain photography. Jim Curran, author of K2: The Story of the Savage Mountain, calls Sella ""possibly the greatest mountain photographer... his name [is] synonymous with technical perfection and aesthetic refinement"". Sella was known for his extraordinary toughness, traversing the Alps at remarkable speed despite carrying heavy photographic gear. His makeshift camera harness and boots - three times heavier than modern ones - are preserved at the Photographic Institute in Biella. His clothing alone weighed over 10kg, while his camera equipment, including a Dallmeyer camera, tripod, and plates, added another 30kg - more than today's airline baggage limits. On the K2 expedition, Sella captured around 250 formal photographs with his Ross & Co camera over four to five months; on Kanchenjunga, about 200, notes Thomson. ""By modern digital standards, this number is nothing extraordinary - and even in the last days of analogue film, it would equate to some eight rolls, what a 1970s photographer could have used in a single morning on a single mountain - but when Sella was photographing, this was a considerable number. ""This meant enormous care and thought was given to each photograph, both because he had relatively few plates he could shoot."" Years later, the famous mountaineer-photographer Ansel Adams would write that the ""purity of Sella's interpretations move the spectator to a religious awe"". High-altitude photography came with risks - many of Sella's most ambitious shots were ruined when humid conditions caused tissue dividers to stick to the negatives. Yet those that survived reveal a masterful eye, notes Thomson. ""Sella was one of the first to recognise how tracks in the snow are as much part of the composition as the mountaineers who made them.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8pwd0p46wo,'Trump study sessions': How Japan PM's homework paid off,2025-02-09T02:24:52.594Z,Shaimaa Khalil,"If Japan needed reassurances it was indeed still the US's top ally and friend in the increasingly unstable Asia-Pacific, it got that and then some. But what was striking about the Trump-Ishiba meeting at the White House was what didn't happen. Unlike most of the Trump domestic and global dynamics so far, this was neither controversial nor confrontational. ""On television, he is very frightening,"" Japanese Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba told reporters after Friday's meeting. ""But when I met him, he was very sincere, very powerful and strong willed,"" he added. There's a lot that ties Washington and Tokyo. Japan has been the top foreign investor in the US for five consecutive years, creating thousands of jobs. And there are 54,000 US military personnel stationed in Japan. But President Donald Trump has given his friends and foes a lot to worry about: from tariff wars against China, Canada and Mexico to his US ""ownership"" of Gaza proposal and his sanctions against the International Criminal Court. ""Trump has made some erratic decisions towards countries that believed themselves to be America's friends,"" said Jeffrey Hall, lecturer at Japan's Kanda University of International Studies. ""There was a fear in Tokyo that the same might happen: that Trump might slap huge tariffs on Japan or start some dispute. But that didn't happen,"" he added. While Trump didn't rule out tariffs against Tokyo, it wasn't the main feature of this meeting. Ishiba went to Washington prepared. He'd studied. Literally. He held ""study sessions"" with staff and sought advice from his predecessor, Fumio Kishida. He also had some help from the widow of the late former PM Shinzo Abe, who had a close relationship with Trump during his first presidency, forged on the golf course. Ishiba's homework paid off. Apart from when Trump mistakenly referred to Nippon Steel as ""Nissan"", there weren't many eye-raising moments like the many other announcements by the US president. In fact - as far as Japan is concerned - this meeting was reassuring. Both leaders seemed to have met eye-to-eye on their countries' plans to boost trade and defence ushering in a ""golden-era"" of Japan-US relations. Ishiba announced his country's plans to increase investment in the US to $1tn (£806bn), as the two economic powers rebalance trade relations. Ishiba said Japanese car makers would boost investment, while Tokyo would expand imports of US liquified natural gas (LNG). This would have been music to Trump's ears and a boost to his ""drill, baby, drill"" announcement from his inauguration speech. The two men also managed to find common ground on the controversial issue of Nippon Steel. Trump said Nippon would ""invest heavily"" in the Pennsylvania-based US Steel without taking a majority stake. The Japanese firm's attempted takeover of US Steel had been previously blocked by President Joe Biden on national security grounds. There were enough boxes ticked for Japan to breathe easy - but the main purpose of Ishiba's visit was personal. The Japanese PM has been in a fraught political position at home - with his minority government keeping a weak grip on power after it was humiliated in October's general elections when they lost their ruling majority. Ishiba was desperate for a win. The man himself has not elicited much confidence in how he would fare opposite a notorious Trump. ""For weeks local media played up the idea that he would not succeed diplomatically - that he was clumsy, not a sociable person and that Trump would eat his lunch, if he made it to Washington,"" said Mr Hall. But Ishiba is walking away with what looks a lot like success. The former Japanese defence minister is a veteran politician known for dense speeches in parliament. Observers have said such speeches manage to confuse some of his opponents and bore others. But in a ""Trump strategy meeting"" with his staff, the biggest piece of advice he reportedly got was: ""Conclusion first. Keep it simple."" ""Ishiba followed a play book to flatter Trump personally and offer him economic investments in the US instead of confronting him"", said Mr Hall. There are several issues that Japan and the US could disagree on. Not least Trump's proposal of a US takeover of the Gaza Strip, which sparked fierce criticism around the world. Japan reiterated its long-standing position of supporting a two-state solution. ""We won't change our stance,"" said Foreign Minister Takeshi Iwaya last week. Tokyo is also watching Trump's trade war with China nervously. But Hall said Japan would not be drawn into the US-China trade war if it could help it. When it comes to China, Japan needs to strike a fine balance. Beijing is Tokyo's largest trading partner. China is one of the largest investment destinations for Japanese companies. On the defence and diplomatic front both the US and Japan are challenged by China's rising influence and assertiveness in the region and globally. Not least with Chinese military's now frequent and provocative moves in waters near Taiwan which Beijing sees as a renegade province. In 2022, Japan, a pacifist nation, announced it would double its military spending by 2027, citing threats posed by China and North Korea, and saying it would acquire the ability to strike enemy bases. The changes marked the most dramatic overhaul to Japan's security strategy since it adopted a pacifist constitution after World War Two. With North Korea continuing its nuclear program, South Korea in political meltdown, and the ongoing US-China rivalry, Japan has yet again presented itself as America's least challenging and only unproblematic friend in the region. ""Japan will avoid any confrontation with Trump when possible. It will most likely become a 'yes' friend,"" said Hall."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c203ql5l8zyo,Modi's BJP wins big in high-stakes Delhi election,2025-02-08T16:29:59.972Z,"Nikita Yadav, Zoya Mateen and Soutik Biswas","Prime Minister Narendra Modi's party will form the government in Indian capital Delhi for the first time in 27 years as it scripted an impressive election victory. The Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) has won or is leading in 48 seats in the 70-member legislative assembly, while the incumbent Aam Aadmi Party (AAP) is ahead in 22 seats, according to data from the Election Commission of India (EC). A party that wins more than the halfway mark of 35 seats can form the government. ""Development wins, good governance triumphs,"" Modi wrote on X, adding his party would leave ""no stone unturned"" in developing Delhi . In a video message on X, the AAP's former Delhi chief minister Arvind Kejriwal said he and his party ""humbly accepted"" the verdict of the people and congratulated the BJP on its win. ""I hope they live up to the expectations of the people who voted for them,"" he said. The election was a battle of prestige for both the BJP and AAP, given Delhi's symbolic importance as the country's capital. The city, a federally-administered territory, had been governed by the AAP since 2013, with voters backing its strong record of welfarism. But the party and its leaders have faced several challenges recently, with leaders embroiled in corruption allegations which they have denied. For the BJP, securing Delhi represents more than just electoral success - it marks a crucial foothold in the nation's capital after being out of power there since 1998. The party threw resources at the Delhi campaign, with Modi as well as Home Minister Amit Shah attending events. Congress, the main opposition party at the national level, was also in the race, but did not win even one seat. The party governed Delhi from 1998 to 2013, but was ousted over allegations of corruption that saw voters turn to AAP instead. It has failed to make a mark since. Experts say the win in politically crucial Delhi will reinforce Modi's popularity among Indian voters after his party lost its outright majority in last year's general election. The defeat is a big blow to the AAP, a much smaller party praised in its early years in power for focusing on improving education and health facilities in the city. It also governs Punjab state, but retaining Delhi would have been a triumph for the beleaguered party now facing questions about its future. After more than a decade in power in Delhi, AAP's appeal has waned, especially among the middle-class, which was once drawn to Kejriwal's anti-corruption stance. Kejriwal, once a champion of the middle-class-led anti-corruption movement, had pivoted to becoming the party of the poor - it is not yet clear when the poor and Delhi's struggling working class abandoned him. Corruption allegations, the jailing of key leaders and Kejriwal's own arrest damaged AAP's campaign, creating a vacuum the BJP swiftly filled. Backed by vast resources and a powerful electoral machine, the BJP's ""double-engine"" pitch - where state and federal governments are ruled by the same party - promised stability and better governance. This is a historic victory - BJP's first Delhi majority in almost 30 years. Its ""Parivartan"" (change) message struck a chord, but its political and financial muscle sealed the landslide win. Fresh off wins in the states of Haryana and Maharashtra, this cements BJP's resurgence after last year's general election setback. With Delhi slipping away, the fragmented opposition is in disarray, while the BJP enters the next electoral cycle with a clear upper hand. On Saturday, the biggest upsets for AAP included top leaders Kejriwal and Manish Sisodia losing in the New Delhi and Jangpura constituencies, respectively. Incumbent Chief Minister Atishi managed only a narrow victory from the Kalkaji constituency. More than 60% of eligible voters cast their ballots. Most exit polls had predicted an absolute majority for the BJP, although such predictions have gone wrong in the past. Much of the BJP campaign targeted Kejriwal, an anti-graft activist, who - along with Sisodia - had been jailed over the past two years in a corruption case relating to a now-scrapped alcohol sales policy. Both leaders, who deny all the charges, separately got bail last year after spending months in jail. Kejriwal has accused Modi's party of carrying out a ""political vendetta"" against him and the AAP, which the BJP denies. Delhi has a unique governance structure. Key decisions related to public order, police and land are taken by the lieutenant governor (LG) who is appointed by the federal government. The state legislature handles matters including education, health and public services. This division has often caused friction between the federal government and state legislature when they are run by rival parties. The power structure was also a reason why the election campaigning in Delhi was more focused on welfare than on political or identity issues, which play a larger role in elections elsewhere in the country. The AAP and BJP campaigns both promised improvements to public schools and free healthcare services, as well as cash handouts to women. Meanwhile, the BJP hoped for a boost from last week's federal budget, which slashed income tax for the salaried middle class, a key voting bloc in the capital. One topic, however, remained largely off the agenda during the bitter weeks-long campaign - Delhi's perennial air pollution crisis, which affects the city of more than 30 million for much of the year. The BJP had promised to reduce the city's Air Quality Index (AQI) by half by 2030 if it won, and other parties also made references to the crisis in their manifestos. But the issue didn't dominate discussions or become a talking point in the election campaign. Follow BBC News India on Instagram, YouTube, Twitter and Facebook."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgxpy2z27vo,Jailed Singapore ex-minister moved to house arrest,2025-02-07T10:53:08.448Z,Koh Ewe,"A former senior minister in Singapore's government, who was jailed following a high-profile trial last year, has been allowed to serve the remainder of his 12-month sentence from home. Subramaniam Iswaran was imprisoned on 7 October after he pleaded guilty to accepting gifts worth more than S$403,000 ($300,000; £240,000) while in office, as well as obstructing the course of justice. Iswaran's case gripped Singapore, where a corruption case involving a public official is rare. The island nation that serves as South East Asia's financial hub prides itself with its squeaky clean image. He was transferred to home arrest on Friday, the Singapore Prison Service (SPS) told local media. In Singapore, inmates may be transferred to home detention after being assessed on factors such as their conduct in prison and response to rehabilitation. Authorities said Iswaran was found to be ""of low risk of re-offending, did not commit any institutional offence in prison, and has strong family support"". While in home detention he will be required to wear an electronic monitoring tag and report to prison authorities for counselling. Local broadcaster Channel News Asia reported seeing Iswaran having a meal in his home on Friday. Iswaran's 12-month prison sentence was longer than what both his defence team and prosecutors sought during his trial. During his sentencing in October, the judge said that public officials like Iswaran should also be seen as having ""greater culpability in abusing their position to obtain valuable gifts"". Iswaran is the first political office-holder in Singapore to be tried in court in the past 50 years. The last time a minister faced a corruption probe was in 1986, when development minister Teh Cheang Wan was investigated for accepting bribes. He killed himself before he was charged."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly9jx0gve0o,India cuts interest rates for the first time in five years,2025-02-07T06:29:56.882Z,Nikhil Inamdar,"India's central bank has cut interest rates for the first time in nearly five years to counter slowing growth in Asia's third largest economy. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced its repo rate from 6.5% to 6.25%, in line with the expectations of many economists. The repo rate is the level at which the central bank lends to commercial banks. The latest cut happens when India's GDP growth is seen slowing to a four year low of 6.7%. RBI governor Sanjay Malhotra said the bank was keeping its policy stance ""neutral"", which would open more space to support growth, signalling further rate cuts. Investment growth and urban consumption in the world's fastest growing major economy have been flagging. Corporate profits have also shrunk in the first half of this financial year. But moderating inflation, an increase in rural demand and good agricultural output will help growth, said Mr Malhotra. The rate cut could lead to marginally lower mortgage and credit card interest rates as well as cheaper borrowing costs for companies. The central bank's rate reduction follows a range of measures previously announced, including an injection of $18bn (£14.48bn) into the domestic banking system, to ease a cash shortage in the economy. It had also cut the cash reserve ratio - or the reserves commercial banks need to maintain with the RBI - by half a percent in December. The RBI's rate move follows the Union Budget's $12bn tax cut for the struggling middle class. Despite this, Mr Modi's government aims to curb spending to reduce the budget deficit. With limited room for fiscal stimulus, economists expect the central bank to cut rates further by 0.5% –1% to support growth, according to various estimates. However, global uncertainties due to US President Donald Trump's tariff war, an outflow of foreign investor money and a depreciating currency - which could further weaken if rates come down - have complicated the RBI's task. The Indian rupee is trading near record lows due to heavy foreign investor outflows from stock markets in recent months."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y204vq9dyo,'My angel went to heaven': Husband mourns actress Barbie Hsu,2025-02-07T04:42:17.195Z,Kelly Ng,"South Korean singer Koo Jun-yup has paid tribute to his late wife Taiwanese actress Barbie Hsu who died last week, saying his ""angel went back to heaven"". In a post on Instagram, Koo added that he was going through ""indescribable grief"" and a time of ""gut-wrenching pain"". Hsu, one of the biggest stars in the Mandarin-speaking world, is believed to have fallen ill and later died while she was visiting Japan with her family members. The sudden death of the 48-year-old star sent shockwaves across the entertainment industry. She was best known for her role in the 2001 TV series Meteor Garden, which became a hit across large parts of Asia. ""On 2 February, 2025, my angel returned to heaven... Right now, I am going through a time of gut-wrenching pain,"" Koo wrote in a post on Instagram late on Thursday. In his post, Koo, better known by his stage name DJ Koo, also called for his family to be left alone in their grief. ""Even before I could properly mourn and grieve this tremendous loss, some heartless people have begun to defame my family and our love. ""Please, can you just let Hsu rest in peace?"" Koo wrote. His comments come after several Chinese language media published reports on who would inherit Hsu's estate, which reportedly includes a property portfolio worth several million dollars. The BBC is unable to verify these details. ""All of Hsu's assets were earned through her hard work to support the family she loved, so I have decided to give full authority over them to my mother-in-law,"" Koo went on to say. ""As for the children's share, I will take legal measures through a lawyer to ensure that bad people cannot touch it, protecting it until they reach adulthood."" Hsu and Koo first met in 1998. At the time, Hsu and her sister were hosts on a popular variety programme, and Koo, who was part of a K-pop duo, Clon, was an interviewee on the show. They eventually started dating but later broke up, reportedly because Koo's management was opposed to the relationship. Hsu later married Chinese businessman Wang Xiaofei, with whom she had two children. The couple were married for 10 years, before an acrimonious divorce in 2021. After their divorce, Hsu reconnected with Koo and they were married in 2022. Her death shocked fans across Asia, where Meteor Garden - an adaptation of the Japanese manga series Boys Over Flowers - was aired and dubbed in local languages. Hsu was also known for hosting Taiwanese variety shows, often with younger sister Dee. In the 1990s, the sisters were part of a pop duo SOS, which gave them their respective stage names, Big S and Little S. Her remains were flown back to Taiwan on Thursday, local media reported."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04nx1vnw17o,"Casinos, high-rises and fraud: The BBC visits a bizarre city built on scams",2025-02-06T23:34:31.693Z,Jonathan Head,"The tall, shiny buildings which rise out of the cornfields on the Myanmar side of the Moei river are a sight so jarring you find yourself blinking to be sure you haven't imagined it. Eight years ago there was nothing over there in Karen State. Just trees, a few roughly built cement buildings, and a long-running civil war which has left this area of Myanmar one of the poorest places on earth. But today, on this spot along the border with Thailand, a small city has emerged like a mirage. It is called Shwe Kokko, or Golden Raintree. It is accused of being a city built on scams, home to a lucrative yet deadly nexus of fraud, money-laundering and human trafficking. The man behind it, She Zhijiang, is languishing in a Bangkok jail, awaiting extradition to China. But Yatai, She Zhijiang's company which built the city, paints a very different vision of Shwe Kokko in its promotional videos – as a resort city, a safe holiday destination for Chinese tourists and haven for the super-rich. The story of Shwe Kokko is also one of the unbridled ambition which has rippled out of China in the last two decades. She Zhijiang dreamed of building this glittering city as his ticket out of the shadowy world of scams and gambling which he inhabited. But by aiming so high he has drawn the attention of Beijing, which is now keen to stamp out the fraud operations along the Thai-Myanmar border which are increasingly targeting Chinese people. Publicity about the scams is also hurting Thai tourism – Thailand is shutting down power to compounds over the border, toughening its banking rules and promising to block visas for those suspected of using Thailand as a transit route. Shwe Kokko has been left marooned in post-coup, war-wracked Myanmar, unable to bring in the flow of investment and visitors it needs to keep going. Yatai is trying to fix the city's sinister image by allowing journalists to see it, holding out hope that more favourable reporting might even get She Zhijiang out of jail. So they invited the BBC to Shwe Kokko. Getting there is tricky. Ever since construction began in 2017, Shwe Kokko has been a forbidden place, off-limits to casual visitors. As the civil war in Myanmar escalated after the 2021 military coup, access became even more difficult. It takes three days from the country's commercial hub Yangon – through multiple checkpoints, blocked roads and a real risk of getting caught in armed skirmishes. Crossing from Thailand takes just a few minutes, but requires careful planning to avoid Thai police and army patrols. She Zhijiang's colleagues took us on a tour, highlighting the newly paved streets, the luxury villas, the trees – ""Mr She believes in making a green city,"" they told us. Our guide was Wang Fugui, who said he was a former police officer from Guangxi in southern China. He ended up in prison in Thailand, on what he insists were trumped-up fraud charges. There he got to know She Zhijiang and became one of his most trusted lieutenants. At first glance, Shwe Kokko has the appearance of a provincial Chinese city. The signs on the buildings are written in Chinese characters, and there is a constant procession of Chinese-made construction vehicles going to and from building sites. Yatai is vague about the tenants of all its buildings, as it is about many things. ""Rich people, from many countries, they rent the villas,"" they told us. And what about the businesses? ""Many businesses. Hotels, casinos."" However, most of the people we saw were local Karen, one of Myanmar's ethnic minorities, who come into Shwe Kokko every day to work. We saw very few of the overseas visitors who are supposed to be the customers of the hotels and casinos. Yatai says there are no more scams in Shwe Kokko. It has put up huge billboards all over town proclaiming, in Chinese, Burmese and English, that forced labour was not allowed, and that ""online businesses"" should leave. But we were quietly told by local people that the scam business was still running. Starting a decade ago in the unchecked frenzy of Chinese investment on the Cambodian coast, then moving to the lawless badlands of Myanmar's border with China, the scam operators have now settled along the Thai-Myanmar border. Around them, the Myanmar military and a hotch-potch of rebel armies and warlords are fighting for control of Karen State. The scams have grown into a multi-billion dollar business. They involve thousands of workers from China, South East Asia, Africa and the Indian subcontinent kept in walled-off compounds where they defraud people all over the world of their savings. Some work there willingly, but others are abducted and forced to work. Those who have escaped have told harrowing stories of torture and beatings. Some have come from Shwe Kokko. We were able to speak to a young woman who had been working in one of the scam centres a couple of weeks before our visit. She had not enjoyed it and been allowed to leave. Her job, she said, was as part of the modelling team, made up mostly of attractive young women, who contact potential victims and try to build an intimate online relationship with them. ""The target is the elderly,"" she said. ""You start a conversation like 'oh you look just like one of my friends'. Once you make friends you encourage them by sending pictures of yourself, sometimes wearing your night clothes."" Then, she explains, the conversation moves to get-rich-quick schemes, such as crypto investments, with the women claiming that's how they made a lot of money. ""When they feel close to you, you pass them on to the chatting section,"" she says. ""The chatting people will continue messaging with the client, persuading them to buy shares in the crypto company."" During our brief time in Shwe Kokko we were only allowed to see what Yatai wanted us to see. Even so, it was evident that the scams have not stopped, and are probably still the main business in the city. Our request to see inside any of the newly built office buildings was turned down. Those are private, they kept telling us. We were escorted at all times by security guards seconded from the militia group which controls this part of the border. We were allowed to film the construction work, and the outsides of the buildings, but not to enter them. Many of the windows had bars on the insides. ""Everybody in Shwe Kokko knows what goes on there,"" said the young woman who used to work in a scam centre. She dismissed Yatai's claim that it no longer permitted scam centres in Shwe Kokko. ""That is a lie. There is no way they don't know about this. The whole city is doing it in those high-rise buildings. No-one goes there for fun. There is no way Yatai doesn't know."" ""I can promise that Yatai would never accept telecom fraud and scams,"" said She Zhijiang on a call from Bangkok's Remand Prison, where he is being held. Yatai wanted us to hear from the man himself, and hooked up a ropey video link. Only Mr Wang could be seen talking to him; we had to stay out of view of the prison guards, and had to rely on Mr Wang to put our questions to him. Not much is known about She Zhijiang, a small-town Chinese entrepreneur who Beijing alleges is a criminal mastermind. Born in a poor village in Hunan province in China in 1982, he left school at 14 and learned computer coding. He appears to have moved to the Philippines in his early 20s and into online gambling, which is illegal in China. This is where he started to make his money. In 2014 he was convicted by a Chinese court of running an illegal lottery, but he stayed overseas. He invested in gambling businesses in Cambodia, and managed to get Cambodian citizenship. He has used at least four different names. In 2016, he struck a deal with a Karen warlord, Saw Chit Thu, to build a new city together. She Zhijiang would provide the funds, the Chinese construction machinery and materials, while Saw Chit Thu and his 8,000 armed fighters would keep it safe. Glitzy videos by Yatai promised a $15bn (£12.1bn) investment and depicted a high-rise wonderland of hotels, casinos and cyberparks. Shwe Kokko was described as part of Xi Jinping's Belt-and-Road Initiative or BRI, bringing Chinese funds and infrastructure to the world. China publicly dissociated itself from She Zhijiang in 2020, and the Myanmar government launched an investigation into Yatai, which was building far beyond the 59 villas authorised by its investment permit and was operating casinos before these had been legalised in Myanmar. In August 2022, acting on a Chinese request to Interpol, She Zhijiang was arrested and imprisoned in Bangkok. He and his business partner Saw Chit Thu have also been sanctioned by the British government for their links to human trafficking. She Zhijiang claims to be a victim of double dealing by the Chinese state. He says he founded his company Yatai on the instruction of the Chinese Ministry of State Security, and insists that Shwe Kokko was then a part of the BRI. He accuses China's communist leadership of turning on him because he refused to give them control of his project. They wanted a colony on the Thai-Myanmar border, he says. China has denied any business relationship with She Zhijiang. While he denied any wrongdoing on Yatai's part, She Zhijiang, however, admitted to ""a high probability"" that scammers were coming to Shwe Kokko to spend their money. ""Because our Yatai City is completely open to anyone who can go in and out freely. Refusing customers, for a businessman like me, is really difficult. This is my weakness."" It is, however, stretching credulity to believe that Yatai, which runs everything in Shwe Kokko, was unable to stop scammers coming in and out of the city. It is also hard to think of any business other than scams which would choose to operate here. With Thailand cutting off power and telecommunications, electricity comes from diesel generators, which are expensive to run. And communications go through Elon Musk's Starlink satellite system, which is also very costly. Yatai's strategy is ""to whitewash the project to create a narrative that Shwe Kokko is a safe city"", says Jason Tower, from the United States Institute for Peace, which has spent years researching the scam operation in Shwe Kokko. He says they may even ""begin moving some of the more notorious components of the scam industry, like torture, into other zones"". But he doesn't think the plan will work: ""What kinds of legitimate businesses will go into Shwe Kokko? It's simply not attractive. The economy will continue to be a scam economy."" When we were eventually allowed to see inside one casino in Shwe Kokko, run by a genial Australian, he told us they were going to close it down. Inside the only customers were local Karen, gambling on a popular arcade-like game where they had to shoot digital fish. We were forbidden from doing any interviews. The back rooms, with the card and roulette tables, were empty. The Australian manager said the casino - built six years ago - had been popular and profitable when there were just one or two of them, before the civil war. But these days, with at least nine in operation, there were not enough customers to go around. The real money was in online gambling, which he said was the main business in Shwe Kokko. It is impossible to know how much money is made through online gambling, and how much through outright criminal activities like money laundering and scams. They are usually run from the same compounds and by the same teams. When we asked Yatai how much money they made they would not tell us – not even a ballpark figure. That is private, they said. The company is registered in Hong Kong, Myanmar and Thailand, but these are little more than shell companies, with very little income or revenue passing through them. We turned down Yatai's offer to see the go-kart track, water park and model farm that they have built. We did glimpse one other casino, while being taken to eat breakfast in Yatai's own luxury hotel, though we could not go inside it. It seemed empty. The only other facility we were allowed to see was a karaoke club, with spectacular private rooms, cavernous domes entirely covered in digital screens on which huge tropical fish and sharks swam. They also ran video loops extolling the vision and virtues of She Zhijiang. This club too seemed deserted, except for some young Chinese women who worked there. They wore opera masks to avoid being identified, and danced unenthusiastically to music for a few minutes before giving up and sitting down. Interviews were not permitted. We were allowed to talk to a local Karen member of staff, but she was so intimidated by this we got little more than her name. In his absence, She Zhijiang has left the running of Shwe Kokko to a young protégé, 31-year-old He Yingxiong. He lives with Wang Fugui in a sprawling villa they have built on the banks of the Moei River, overlooking Thailand, and guarded by massive Chinese bodyguards. There they play mahjong, eat the finest food and drink, and keep an eye on business. Mr He has a slightly different explanation from his boss for the scams still operating under their noses. ""We are just property developers,"" he said. ""I can guarantee that this kind of thing does not happen here. ""But even if it does, the local people have their own legal system, so it is their job to deal with it. Our job is just to provide good infrastructure, good buildings and supporting industries."" But there is no legal system in this part of Myanmar, nor any government. It is ruled by the various armed groups which control different bits of territory along the Thai border. Their commanders decide who can build or run a business, taking their cut to help fund their wars against the Myanmar military, or against each other. Many of them are known to be hosting scam compounds. Mr He admitted that it was the war which had allowed Yatai to obtain the land so cheaply. Karen human rights groups have accused Saw Chit Thu of driving the original inhabitants off their land, with minimal compensation, though it is clear Yatai is also providing badly needed jobs for the locals. It is the lawlessness of Karen State which makes it so appealing to illegal businesses – and that doesn't help the image of Shwe Kokko. Neither do recent headlines. Last month a 22-year-old Chinese actor, Wang Xing, was rescued from a scam centre on the border after being lured to Thailand with an offer of work on a movie shoot. His disappearance spurred a barrage of questions on Chinese social media, forcing the Thai and Chinese authorities to mount a joint operation to free him. Chinese tourists have been cancelling their holidays in Thailand, fearing for their safety. Other rescues have followed. The BBC has been sent emails by some scam victims pleading for help; rescue organisations believe there are still thousands trapped. Nearly all are in smaller compounds along the border south of Shwe Kokko. Yatai stressed to us that they are not the same as these rougher operations, some little more than a collection of sheds built in forest clearings. That is where all the bad things happen now, they said. They talked about KK Park, a notorious compound south of the border town of Myawaddy, and Dongmei, a cluster of low-rise buildings run by a prominent Chinese crime lord called Wan Kuok Koi, better known as Broken Tooth. That distinction hasn't helped She Zhijiang, who once had the ear of politicians, police bosses and even minor royalty in Thailand. Today he appears to have lost even the influence he once had in prison, to buy himself special privileges. He has complained of being roughed up by the guards. His lawyers are appealing against the Interpol red notice used to justify his arrest, but China's voice will probably be loudest in determining his fate. From our interview with him, Shi Zhijiang seemed genuinely outraged over his sudden reversal of fortune. ""Before, I had no understanding of human rights, but now I really understand how horrible it is to have human rights infringed upon,"" he said. ""It is hard to imagine how the human rights of ordinary people in China are trampled upon when a respected businessman like me, who used to be able to go to the same state banquets as Xi Jinping, does not have his human rights and dignity protected in any way."" It seems he really did believe he could build something which would one day transcend Shwe Kokko's sordid origins as a scam city. What happens to it now is hard to guess, but if the Thai and Chinese governments keep acting to shut down the scams, the money will start to dry up."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm27k2m91p7o,India 'engaging with US' after shackled deportees spark anger,2025-02-06T10:05:53.497Z,Cherylann Mollan,"India's Foreign Minister S Jaishankar has told parliament the government is working with the US to ensure Indian citizens are not mistreated while being deported. His statement came a day after a US military flight brought back 104 Indians accused of entering the US illegally. One of the deportees told the BBC they had been handcuffed throughout the 40-hour flight, sparking criticism. But Jaishankar said he had been told by the US that women and children were not restrained. Deportation flights to India had been taking place for several years and US procedures allowed for the use of restraints, he added. Deportation in the US is organised and executed by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). ""We have been informed by ICE that women and children are not restrained,"" Jaishankar said. He added that according to ICE, the needs of deportees during transit, including for food and medical attention, were attended to and deportees could be unrestrained during bathroom breaks. ""There has been no change from past procedure,"" he added. However Jaspal Singh, one of the deportees on the flight that landed in Amritsar city in the state of Punjab on Wednesday, told BBC Punjabi that he was shackled throughout the flight. ""We were tortured in many ways. My hands and feet were tied after we were put on the plane. The plane stopped at several places,"" he said, adding that he was unshackled only after the plane landed in Amritsar. The US has not given further details of how deportees were treated on the flight. Officials have said that enforcing immigration laws is ""critically important to the national security and public safety of the United States"" and it was US policy to ""faithfully execute the immigration laws against all inadmissible and removable aliens"". The US border patrol chief posted video showing deportees in shackles, saying the deportation flight to India was the ""farthest deportation flight yet using military transport"". President Donald Trump has made the mass deportation of undocumented foreign nationals a key policy. The US is said to have identified about 18,000 Indian nationals it believes entered illegally. Trump has said India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi had assured him that the country would ""do what's right"" in accepting US deportations. In his statement on Thursday, Jaishankar said all countries had an obligation to take back their nationals who had entered other countries illegally. They often faced dangerous journeys and inhumane working conditions once they had reached their destinations, he said. Fraudulent Indian travel agencies are known to take huge sums of money from people desperate to travel abroad for work, and then make them undertake dangerous journeys to avoid being caught by immigration officials. Jaspal said he had taken a loan of 4m rupees ($46,000; £37,000] to travel to the US, a dangerous journey that took months and during which he saw bodies in the jungle of other migrants who had died on the route. Opposition leaders have condemned the manner in which migrants were brought back to the country and have asked the government what action it plans to take over the treatment meted out to its citizens. Congress MP Manickam Tagore called it ""shocking and shameful"". ""The way the US is deporting Indians - chained like criminals - is inhumane and unacceptable,"" he posted on X. Congress MP Shashi Tharoor said the US had the right to deport people who had entered the country illegally but criticised the manner in which they were deported. ""To send them like this abruptly in a military aircraft and in handcuffs is an insult to India, it's an insult to the dignity of Indians,"" he said. This isn't the first time that the US has faced the ire of politicians for allegedly mistreating migrants from their countries. Last month, Brazil's government expressed outrage after about 88 of its nationals arrived in their homeland handcuffed. The government said that it would demand an explanation from Washington over the ""degrading treatment of passengers on the flight"". Meanwhile, Colombia sent its own planes to collect deportees after Colombian President Gustavo Petro barred US military aircraft from landing, arguing that those on board were being treated like criminals. Rights groups have urged countries to ensure deportees are treated humanely. Additional reporting by Gurpreet Chawla, BBC Punjabi"

The rollout is set to happen in 2026. Investigators said last week that they had found evidence of a bird strike on the Boeing 737-800 plane - with feathers and blood stains found on both the plane's engines. An investigation into the crash - the deadliest on South Korean soil - is still ongoing but will focus on the role of the bird strike as well as a concrete structure at the end of the runway, which the plane slammed into after making an emergency landing. ""Bird detection radars will be installed at all airports to enhance early detection of distant birds and improve response capabilities for aircraft,"" said the Ministry of Land in a statement on Thursday. Bird detection radar detects the size of birds and their movement paths and relays this information to air traffic controllers. The ministry added that all airports would also need to be equipped with at least one thermal imaging camera. Currently only four airports in South Korea are equipped with thermal imaging cameras. It is unclear if any of them have bird detection radars in place. Sites that attract birds, like rubbish dumps, must also be moved away from airports. Earlier last month, South Korea announced that seven airports would have their runway safety areas adapted following a review of all the country's airports that was carried out after the crash. The cause of the crash is still unknown but air safety experts had earlier said the number of casualties could have been much lower if not for the structure that the plane crashed into after making an emergency landing.  On 29 December, the plane, from budget airline Jeju Air, had taken off from Bangkok and was flying to Muan International Airport in the country's south-west. At about 08:57 local time, three minutes after pilots made contact with the airport, the control tower advised the crew to be cautious of ""bird activity"". At 08:59, the pilot reported that the plane had struck a bird and declared a mayday signal. The pilot then requested permission to land from the opposite direction, during which it belly-landed without its landing gear deployed. It overran the runway and exploded after slamming into the concrete structure, a preliminary investigation report concluded. Flight data and cockpit voice recorders stopped recording four minutes before the disaster, an investigation into the black boxes later found. The 179 passengers onboard the Boeing B737-800 plane were aged between three and 78 years old, although most were in their 40s, 50s and 60s. Two cabin crew members were the only survivors."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77rm2gmzj1o,Carmaker Kia becomes latest global firm to face tax trouble in India,2025-02-06T07:11:28.096Z,Nikhil Inamdar,"Indian tax authorities have sent a confidential notice to South Korean car maker Kia Motors accusing it of evading millions of dollars in taxes. The amount could be as high as $155m (£125m) and the notice was sent in April last year, according to Reuters. Kia India told the BBC it has already filed a ""detailed response supported by comprehensive evidence and documentation"" to the tax claim, issued by a customs commissioner in the city of Chennai. It did not provide further details. The BBC has approached the finance ministry for comment. Kia has a manufacturing facility in the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh and has sold more than a million cars in India since its launch in 2019. Reuters, which first reported the story, said the government's 432 page notice accused Kia of importing the components for its Carnival car model in separate lots rather than as a single shipment, a move that attracts significantly lower customs duties. Last year, Indian officials slapped a similar tax notice of $1.4bn on German auto giant Volkswagen's unit, Skoda Auto Volkswagen India. Volkswagen has challenged the demand in the Bombay High Court and said it is ""availing itself of all legal remedies"". The pile up of these new tax disputes and lack of quick resolution mechanisms could have significant implications for foreign investment into India, whose economy has slowed in recent months. Net foreign direct investment (FDI) into the economy has halved over the last year, according to calculations by HSBC Securities, due to a number of reasons. Such cases also raise concern among foreign investors about policy uncertainty, say experts. ""The issue is being agitated before the courts and so it would not be appropriate to comment on the merits of the revenues' claim,"" says Dinesh Kanabar, tax expert and former Deputy CEO of KPMG India. ""What, however, is concerning is the dispute resolution process in India takes several years and, in the meantime, there is a risk of having to make a part payment of the demand."" If India is to revive FDI inflows, addressing ""ease of business and the tax dispute resolution process"" will be critical, he adds. There has been a spate of high-profile tax disputes between the Indian government and global corporations where litigation has dragged on for years. The most high-profile was a $2bn tax demand on Vodafone over its purchase of the Indian arm of Hutchison in 2007, where the court ruled in favour of the UK telecoms company. Similarly, Edinburgh-based oil and gas major Cairn Energy was embroiled in a longstanding $1.4bn dispute with the taxmen over a 2014 retrospective bill that went to an international tribunal. Cairn won the case and the government was forced to settle last year. ""We need a degree of accountability at the tax office, given that the track record of defending demands in appeal is quite poor,"" said Mr Kanabar."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpqlxrdlg3yo,Fiji rugby director fired for women's team 'gay problem' remarks,2025-02-06T05:50:35.619Z,Koh Ewe,"The director of the Fiji Rugby Union has been fired just days into her new role, after she stirred controversy with remarks that the women's national team had a ""gay problem"". The Fiji Rugby Union said in a statement on Wednesday that it had terminated Laijipa Naulivou's appointment as director. The move comes as women's rights advocates criticised the ""harmful and discriminatory"" comments. In the interview, Naulivou said she had also previously recommended the coach be removed, and asked for a panel be set up to select the team instead of ""a person who practices lesbianism being up there and choosing her people."" To me that is unethical and it's not right,"" she said, adding that player retention and ""this gay problem"" were also the main challenges facing European rugby teams. She added that homosexuality was ""one big drawback"" when the Fiji women's team participated in a previous HSBC Sevens tournament. Naulivou, who had been asked to manage the team three weeks prior to the tournament, wrote a report following its poor performance in the tournament where she had advocated for the removal of the coach. Fiji Women's Rights Movement said in a statement on Tuesday that it was ""appalled"" by Naulivou's comments. ""The notion that being gay is a 'problem' in women's rugby is deeply troubling and perpetuates harmful stereotypes that have no place in modern sports or society,"" said the group's executive director Nalini Singh. ""Rather than focusing your efforts on the sexuality of the players, you do your job and look for adequate funding and provide for the well-being of the women rugby players so that they don't have to sleep on benches in front of airports and walk miles to their training,"" she added. Local media previously reported that the members of the women's team had spent a night on benches outside Sydney Airport on their way to the Dubai Sevens in 2023, while the men's team slept in a nearby hotel. As the disparity between the treatment of the two teams sparked anger among fans, authorities attributed the incident to a ""miscommunication"". In 2016, the Fiji women's rugby team became the first among Pacific nations to qualify for the Rio Olympics. In 2021, the team won a bronze medal at the Tokyo Olympics. But at the Paris Games last year, they were knocked out in the group stage and came in last place out of the 12 competing teams. At the time as well, suggestions of lesbianism were blamed for causing a rift in the team. Naulivou is a prominent figure in the local rugby scene, known for being the first captain of the women's national team and an advocate for the inclusion of women in the male-dominated sport. On Saturday, Naulivou was appointed as the Fiji Rugby Union's director after her predecessor resigned for personal reasons. She has also tried to quit amid the recent controversy, the Fiji Rugby Union said. ""While she had tendered her resignation, the Board determined that a firm stance was necessary to reinforce its commitment to upholding professional standards and safeguarding the integrity of Fiji Rugby,"" it said. ""Our women's team and all players can rest assured that this will in no way impact their opportunities, representation, and continued development as integral members of Fiji Rugby."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqld7x1n22do,Protesters set fire to ex-Bangladesh PM's family home,2025-02-06T03:46:33.918Z,Koh Ewe Anbarasan Ethirajan,"Protesters in Bangladesh have vandalised and set fire to the former family home of deposed prime minister Sheikh Hasina, as well as those of other members of her party. The unrest was sparked by news that Hasina would address the country via social media from India, where she has been in exile since student-led protests ousted her last year. The 77-year-old Hasina, who was in charge of Bangladesh for 20 years, was seen as an autocrat whose government ruthlessly clamped down on dissent. On Wednesday evening, an excavator smashed down the house of Hasina's late father, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman, who is also Bangladesh's founding president. The structure had been repurposed into a museum. Hasina's father is widely viewed as an independence hero, but anger at his daughter has tarnished his legacy among Hasina's critics. In a Facebook livestream, Hasina condemned the attack and demanded ""justice"". ""They can demolish a building, but they can't erase history,"" she said. Hasina, once hailed as a pro-democracy icon, has seen her reputation sour after taking office. She has been accused of rigging elections and jailing her critics, and her administration was widely seen as corrupt. She faces arrest warrants for cracking down on the student-led protests last year, which saw hundreds of people killed. While Hasina fled to India last August, anger has not dissipated against her and her Awami League partymates. On Wednesday, protesters also vandalised and torched the houses and businesses of senior Awami League leaders. There have been calls on social media to rid the country of ""pilgrimage sites of fascism"". Police told the BBC's Bengali service that around 700 protesters showed up at the residence on Wednesday night, and dozens of police officers were deployed. Since Hasina's ouster, a caretaker government led by Nobel laureate Muhammad Yunus has kept the country running. But it has struggled to quell lingering unrest. Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets in recent months, demanding Hasina to be prosecuted for her deadly crackdown on student protesters. While Yunus' government tries to get Hasina extradited from India, it is also dealing with a looming economic crisis - Yunus has accused Hasina of faking Bangladesh's economic growth and laundering billions of dollars during her rule. Yunus has pledged to hold elections in late 2025 or early 2026."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7ze00ly1zo,Indian media pile into lawsuit against OpenAI chatbot ChatGPT,2025-02-05T23:38:26.219Z,Umang Poddar,"India's biggest news organisations are seeking to join a lawsuit against OpenAI, the US startup behind ChatGPT, for alleged unauthorised use of their content. The news organisations include some of India's oldest publications like The Indian Express, The Hindu, The India Today group, billionaire Gautam Adani-owned NDTV, and over a dozen others. OpenAI denies the allegations and told the BBC that it uses ""publicly available data"" that are in line with ""widely accepted legal precedents"". On Wednesday, OpenAI CEO Sam Altman was in Delhi to discuss India's plan for a low-cost AI ecosystem with IT Minister Ashwini Vaishnaw. He said India ""should be one of the leaders of the AI revolution"" and said earlier comments from 2023, when he said Indian firms would struggle to compete, had been taken out of context. ""India is an incredibly important market for AI in general and for OpenAI in particular,"" local media quoted him as saying at the event. The legal case filed against OpenAI in November by Asian News International (ANI), India's largest news agency, is the first of its kind in India. ANI accuses ChatGPT of using its copyrighted material illegally - which OpenAI denies - and is seeking damages of 20m rupees ($230,000; £185,000). The case holds significance for ChatGPT given its plans to expand in the country. According to a survey, India already has the largest user base of ChatGPT. Chatbots like ChatGPT are trained on massive datasets collected by crawling through the internet. The content produced by nearly 450 news channels and 17,000 newspapers in India holds huge potential for this. There is, however, no clarity on what material ChatGPT can legally collect and use for this purpose. OpenAI is facing at least a dozen lawsuits across the world filed by publishers, artists and news organisations, who have all accused ChatGPT of using their content without permission. The most prominent of them was filed by The New York Times in December 2023, in which the newspaper demanded ""billions of dollars"" in damages from OpenAI and Microsoft, its backer. ""A decision by any court would also hold some persuasive value for other similar cases around the world,"" says Vibhav Mithal, a lawyer specialising in artificial intelligence at the Indian law firm Anand and Anand. Mr Mithal said the verdict in the lawsuit filed by ANI could ""define how these AI models will operate in the future"" and ""what copyrighted news content can be used to train AI generative models [like ChatGPT]"". A court ruling in ANI's favour could spark further legal cases as well as opening the possibility of AI companies entering into license sharing agreements with content creators, which some companies have already started doing. ""But a ruling in OpenAI's favour will lead to more freedom to use copyrighted protected data to train AI models,"" he said. ANI provides news to its paying subscribers and owns exclusive copyright over a large archive of text, images and videos. In its suit filed in the Delhi High Court, ANI says that OpenAI used its content to train ChatGPT without permission. ANI has argued that this led to the chatbot getting better and has profited OpenAI. The news agency said that before filing the suit, it had told OpenAI its content was being used unlawfully and offered to grant the company a license to use its data. ANI says OpenAI declined the offer and put the news agency on an internal blocklist so that its data is no longer collected. It also asked ANI to disable certain web crawlers to ensure that its content was not picked up by ChatGPT. The news agency says that despite these measures, ChatGPT picks up its content from websites of its subscribers. This has enriched OpenAI ""unjustly"", it says. ANI also says in its suit that the chatbot produces its content verbatim for certain prompts. In some instances, ANI says, ChatGPT has falsely attributed statements to the news agency, hampering its credibility and misleading the public. Apart from seeking compensation for damages, ANI has asked the court to direct OpenAI to stop storing and using its work. In its response, OpenAI says it opposes the case being filed in India since the company and its servers are not located in the country and the chatbot has also not been trained there. In December, the Federation of Indian Publishers, which claims to represent 80% of Indian publishers including the Indian offices of Penguin Random House and Oxford University Press, filed an application in court saying that they were ""directly affected"" by this case and should be allowed to present their arguments as well. A month later, Digital News Publishers Association (DNPA), which represents leading Indian news outlets, and three other media outlets filed a similar application. They argued that while OpenAI had entered into licensing agreements with international news publishers such as the Associated Press and Financial Times, a similar model had not been followed in India. DNPA told the court the case would affect the livelihood of journalists and the country's entire news industry. OpenAI has, however, argued that chatbots are not a ""substitute"" for news subscriptions and are not used for such purposes. The court has not admitted these applications by the publishers yet and OpenAI has argued that the court should not hear them. But the judge clarified that even if these associations are allowed to argue, the court will restrict itself to ANI's claims since the other parties had not filed their own lawsuits. Meanwhile, OpenAI told the BBC it is engaging in ""constructive partnerships and conversations"" with news organisations around the world, including India, to ""work collaboratively"". Analysts say the lawsuits filed against ChatGPT across the world could bring into focus aspects of chatbots that have escaped scrutiny so far. Dr Sivaramakrishnan R Guruvayur, whose research focuses on responsible use of artificial intelligence, says that the data used to train chatbots is one such aspect. The ANI-OpenAI case will lead the court ""to evaluate the data sources"" of chatbots, he said. Governments across the world have been grappling with how to regulate AI. In 2023, Italy blocked ChatGPT saying that the chatbot's mass collection and storage of personal data raised privacy concerns. The European Union approved a law to regulate AI last year. The Indian government too has indicated plans to regulate AI.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce3ndgd6076o,Prince Rahim Al-Hussaini appointed new Aga Khan,2025-02-05T20:38:08.437Z,Maia Davies,"Prince Rahim Al-Hussaini has been named the new Aga Khan, spiritual leader of millions of Shia Ismaili Muslims around the world. He will take on the role from his father Prince Karim Aga Khan, who died on Tuesday at the age of 88. The appointment was made after Prince Karim's will was unsealed, the Aga Khan Development Network said in a statement. Prince Rahim Al-Hussaini Aga Khan V will be the 50th hereditary Imam of the Ismaili Muslims, who say they are direct descendants of the Prophet Muhammad. The Ismailis are a Shia Muslim sect who revere a number of Imams, including Imam Ismail, who died in AD765. They have a worldwide population of about 15 million, including 500,000 in Pakistan. There are also large populations in India, Afghanistan and parts of Africa. Prince Karim Aga Khan succeeded his grandfather as Imam of the Ismaili Muslims in 1957 at the age of 20. He died surrounded by family in Lisbon, Portugal, which is the seat of the Ismaili Imamat. A funeral will be held there in coming days. During his time as the spiritual leader of the Ismaili Muslim community, the late Aga Khan helped found a charity responsible for running hundreds of hospitals, educational and cultural projects, mainly in the developing world. He was also known for his immense wealth. Forbes magazine in 2008 estimated his fortune amounted to $1bn (£801m). Business ventures included hotels and telecommunications companies as well as a sizeable investments in horse breeding. He was a leading owner and breeder of racehorses in the UK, France and Ireland, breeding Shergar, once the most famous and most valuable racehorse in the world. The new Aga Khan is the eldest son of his late father and Begum Salimah, a British ex-model who converted to Islam and changed her name from Sarah Croker Poole. The US-educated, Swiss-based Rahim is deeply involved with the network of charities and agencies his father helped spearhead. According to the Aga Khan Development Network (AKDN) website, Prince Rahim has served on many of its boards and he currently chairs its Environment and Climate Committee. ""Prince Rahim has been particularly concerned with the AKDN's drive to protect the environment and mitigate the effects of climate change,"" the website said, adding that he was also interested in work ""addressing the needs of those living in the greatest poverty"". Prince Rahim has two sons through his marriage to former American fashion model Kendra Spears."

Duterte has been accused of misusing millions of dollars in public funds and threatening to have President Ferdinand ""Bongbong"" Marcos Jr assassinated. She has denied the charges and alleged she is the victim of a political vendetta. The shock move is widely seen as an escalation of the bitter feud between Duterte and Marcos which has kept the nation on edge for months. Both are scions of Philippine political dynasties: she is the daughter of former president Rodrigo Duterte, while he is the son of the late strongman leader Ferdinand Marcos Sr. A total of 215 out of 306 members of the House of Representatives voted for impeachment, well above the one-third threshold needed for the bill to pass. The bill will now be heard by the 24-member Senate, which will convene as an impeachment court. If found guilty, Duterte faces removal from her post and would be the first vice-president in Philippine history to be impeached. She is expected to stay in office until the Senate delivers its judgement. A trial date has not been set yet. Duterte is widely perceived as a potential successor to Marcos, who is ineligible to run again in 2028 as the constitution limits presidents to a single six-year term. An impeachment would effectively bar her from the presidency, as she would be permanently banned from holding public office. The move comes ahead of the mid-term elections in May, which will be seen as a referendum for Marcos halfway into his term as well a barometer of public support for Duterte. Duterte has not commented on the impeachment vote. But her elder brother who represents their hometown of Davao in parliament, Paolo Duterte, said the administration was ""treading on dangerous ground"" with what he described as a ""clear act of political persecution"". Marcos has also not commented on Duterte's impeachment. In November, he had said it would be a ""waste of time"" for lawmakers to impeach her when it has more important work to do. Since the end of Ferdinand Marcos Sr's dictatorship and the restoration of democracy in 1986, only one sitting president has been impeached - Joseph Estrada in 2000, for alleged corruption. But his trial ended without a judgement after a popular revolt forced him from power in January 2001. Only one impeachment trial made it to a verdict, that of former Supreme Court chief justice Renato Corona, who was convicted of corruption in 2012. Both the Estrada and Corona impeachment trials were highly politicised and divisive affairs and dragged on for months. Duterte and Marcos had presented a picture of unity when they ran for the 2022 elections, calling themselves the ""UniTeam"". But cracks began to appear even before they assumed office, when Duterte asked to handle the defence portfolio in Marcos' cabinet but instead was made education minister. Their alliance unravelled further soon after they took power, as they pursued their separate political agendas while differing on crucial fronts such as diplomacy. Their differences on the Philippines' relationship to the US and China became more pronounced, as encounters between Philippine and Chinese ships in disputed waters became more frequent. Marcos has pivoted the Philippines back to the US, reversing the pro-China stance of Duterte's father. He has also promised a less violent approach against illegal drug rings, dialling back the elder Duterte's ""war on drugs"" that left over 6,000 suspects killed, according to a government count. The lower house of parliament, where Marcos's allies hold power, then started scrutinising Duterte's budget requests, particularly her confidential funds which are not covered by state audits. In July last year, she resigned from the cabinet. The feud took a dramatic turn a few months later when, in a late-night livestreamed press conference, Duterte said she ""talked to a person"" to ""go kill"" Marcos if she were assassinated. She later said that she was not plotting to assassinate the President and Marcos had dismissed the threat as a ""storm in a teacup"". "

""I had erased some words and asked him to write them. I assumed he was angry and that's why he was not holding the pencil properly,"" she told the Indian Express newspaper. She never imagined his struggle to hold a pencil was the first sign of Guillain-Barré Syndrome (GBS), a rare disorder where the immune system attacks nerve cells, causing muscle weakness and paralysis. Within days, the boy was in intensive care, unable to move his arms or legs. As his condition worsened, he lost the ability to swallow, speak, and eventually breathe, requiring ventilator support. He is now recovering. The boy is among around 160 reported cases of GBS since early January in Pune, an education and IT hub, ringed by industrial towns and villages. There have been five suspected deaths. Currently, 48 patients are in intensive care, 21 on ventilator, and 38 have been discharged, according to official figures. GBS begins with tingling or numbness in the feet and hands, followed by muscle weakness and difficulty moving joints. Symptoms worsen over two to four weeks, typically starting in the arms and legs. The reported mortality rate varies between three and 13%, depending on severity and quality of health care support. The outbreak in Pune is being traced to a pathogen called campylobacter jejuni, a leading cause of foodborne infections, and the biggest driver of GBS worldwide. The link between the two was discovered in the 1990s in rural China, where the pathogen was common in chickens, and GBS outbreaks occurred every monsoon as children played in water contaminated by chicken or duck droppings. GBS is not entirely uncommon in India. Monojit Debnath and Madhu Nagappa, of Bangalore-based National Institute of Mental Health and Neurosciences (NIMHANS), studied 150 GBS patients over a five year period between 2014 and 2019. Their findings showed 79% of the patients had evidence of prior infections, with a third testing positive for campylobacter. Notably, co-infections were more common, occurring in 65%, suggesting a complex interplay of bacteria and viruses. More recently, outbreaks linked to the pathogen have been reported from all over the world. In the first seven months of 2023, Peru reported over 200 suspected cases and at least four deaths of GBS, prompting the government to declare a national health emergency and strengthen public health measures. Two-thirds of the cases were linked to campylobacter. In countries with good hygiene, fewer GBS cases are linked to campylobacter, with respiratory infections being a major contributor, say experts. There have been other triggers as well. In 2015 Brazil reported a cluster of GBS cases linked to the Zika virus. Vaccines can rarely trigger GBS, but one Covid vaccine was reportedly linked to a few hundred GBS cases in the UK in 2021. ""Campylobacter is endemic with hundreds of thousands of cases taking place all the time. It is always existing in the environment,"" Hugh Willison, a professor of neurology at University of Glasgow told me. Yet, it is not easy to develop GBS, scientists say. There's a specific strain of campylobacter, which has a sugar-coated outer layer, and in rare cases, its molecular structure matches the coating of human nerve cells. When the patient's immune system attacks the bacteria, it may end up targeting the nerves as well – a process called molecular mimicry – leading to GBS. However, a small fraction of campylobacter strains have this nerve-like coat. ""In Pune, a strain of campylobacter with this molecular feature is likely to be circulating, and a surge in infections with this strain consequently leads to a higher number of GBS cases,"" says Prof Willison. Most experts estimate that about one in 100 campylobacter strains carry the GBS risk, and one in 100 people infected with such a strain develop GBS, making the overall risk roughly one in 10,000. That creates what Prof Willison describes as an ""immunological Russian roulette"", triggering an ""acute neurological tsunami"" that surges through the peripheral nervous system. Once the immune response subsides, the attack wanes – but the body still needs time, medical care, and support to repair the damage. What makes things worse is that there is no cure for GBS. In GBS, the body produces antibodies against campylobacter, which then attack the nerves. Physicians use ""plasma exchange"", a process that filters blood to remove the harmful antibodies, along with intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a therapeutic antibody derived from normal blood, to help reduce the severity of the disease. The other challenge is that there is no single test to diagnose GBS. The diagnosis, say physicians, is mainly based on clinical features. It presents itself as a form of paralysis which can be also caused by polio, viruses or rare neurological disease. ""The diagnosis is a constellation of clinical features. Misdiagnosis or no diagnosis or late diagnosis can happen easily,"" says Prof Willison. India's uneven public health system presents a challenge, as doctors in rural areas may struggle to diagnose GBS. One reason, possibly, why the World Health Organization (WHO) teams are in Pune, is collaborating with federal and state health workers to trace, test, and monitor cases, and analysing trends to support effective treatment. Authorities say they have surveilled more than 60,000 houses, picked up 160 water samples for tests, and asked people to drink boiled water and eat fresh and clean food, and not have ""stale food and partially cooked chicken or mutton"". While most cases of GBS around the world come from undercooked poultry, it can also spread through water, similar to cholera or salmonella, experts say. Contaminated water used for washing or preparing street food makes it easy for the bacteria to spread. Clearly, in Pune, a campylobacter strain with the distinctive molecular feature is circulating, affecting a large number of people. What is not clear is whether this has been due to large scale contamination of water supply or a lot of people consuming infected poultry. ""We appeal to people not to panic,"" says a health department advisory. But in the face of uncertainty, it is easier said than done."

One of the biggest stars in the Mandarin-speaking world, Hsu became a familiar face even in the Philippines, Indonesia and Thailand after Meteor Garden was dubbed in local languages. ""I can't believe it,"" read one comment on Chinese social media platform Weibo, echoing the sentiments of millions of shocked fans who have been paying tribute. She is believed to have fallen ill while visiting Japan. Her sister, Dee Hsu, confirmed her death to Taiwan's TVBS News on Monday. ""During the Lunar New Year, our family came to Japan for vacation. My dearest sister Barbie has unfortunately left us after getting pneumonia, triggered by influenza,"" Dee Hsu said in a statement shared by her manager. Hsu, who had a history of epilepsy and heart disease, was hospitalised previously due to seizures. She leaves behind her husband, South Korean singer DJ Koo, and two children from an earlier marriage. She and her ex-husband, Chinese businessman Wang Xiaofei, were married for 10 years, before an acrimonious divorce in 2021. Hsu began her career at 17, as part of a pop duo with her sister Dee. They became famous as TV hosts, known for their animated style and sense of humour. But it was Meteor Garden, a TV adaptation of a 1990s Japanese comic, that turned Hsu into a star whose fame stretched beyond Chinese entertainment. In the drama, Hsu played Shancai, a teen from a middle-class family who attends an elite private school and finds herself entangled in a love web with the heirs of wealthy families. Her four male co-stars in Meteor Garden would later form the Taiwanese boyband F4, one of the most popular Mandopop groups of the 2000s. On Monday, F4 member Ken Chu shared a black, empty screen as well as a group photo with Hsu on Instagram. Then on Weibo, he wrote: ""What a bolt from the blue."" After Meteor Garden, Hsu starred in more than a dozen TV shows and movies, including popular romantic dramas like Corner With Love and Summer's Desire. She took a break from acting in 2012, but continued to appear in reality shows. Aya Liu, a host and long-time friend of the Hsu sisters, wrote on Weibo that she had met Hsu at a gathering last month, where they had promised to meet more often. ""I didn't think that would be our last gathering,"" Liu wrote. ""Rest in peace, the most beautiful queen."" Hsu was the top trending topic on Weibo on Monday. ""She was only 48 years old… this is too sudden. This is a little difficult to accept,"" read one comment. Posts about influenza in Japan were also trending as fans tried to understand how she had fallen sick. When Meteor Garden aired in the 2000s, at a time when Taiwanese shows and music dominated pop culture in the region, the modern, high-school take on Cinderella was a hit. Young women took fashion inspiration from Hsu's Shancai and swooned over F4. The floppy hairstyles sported by the male leads were plastered on walls in hair salons, as young men across South East Asia and East Asia tried to emulate the look. In the Philippines, local broadcasters reportedly aired the entire series eight times to satisfy fan demand. Bootleg copies of the series were also sold at roadside stalls. Meteor Garden's theme songs were released in other languages, quickly becoming hits on the radio and on TV. More than 20 years on, the show's popularity has endured even as remakes attracted new fans. It has inspired versions in Japan, South Korea, China and India. On social media, tributes to Hsu have poured in from across the region, from Chinese users on Weibo, to Southeast Asian fans on X, to Meta's Threads, which is particularly popular in Taiwan. ""Big S has always been a part of my youth,"" wrote one fan on Threads, referring to Hsu by her nickname. An X user wrote: ""Meteor Garden raised an entire generation of Asians. Thank you Barbie Hsu for giving life to Shancai."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwypk49y8dxo,Chinese fashion giant Shein re-enters India five years after ban,2025-02-03T06:39:53.286Z,Nikita Yadav,"Chinese fast fashion app Shein has relaunched in India five years after it was banned by Delhi, under a deal with Indian firm Reliance Retail. An official from Reliance Retail, who did not wish to be named, told the BBC the firm has entered a long-term licensing deal with the parent company to sell products manufactured and sourced in India on the platform. The group has not yet made an official announcement. Shein's re-entry to the Indian market comes with strict terms, which include saving all data within the country, India's Commerce Minister Piyush Goyal said in December. In 2020 India banned Shein and dozens of other Chinese apps including TikTok. It said this was in response to data security concerns and it followed a spike in tensions with China after clashes between the two countries' armies in a disputed Himalayan border area. The app was launched in India on Friday night and has so far been downloaded by more than 10,000 people. It is offering fashionwear for as little as 199 rupees ($2.30; £1.90). Shein is currently delivering to consumers only in the cities of Delhi, Mumbai and Bengaluru, but will soon offer services across India, according to a notification on the app. Over the last decade, Shein has gone from a little-known brand among older shoppers to one of the biggest fast fashion retailers globally. Today, it ships to customers in 150 countries across the world. Before the ban it became a big hit in India as it gave people a variety of options to buy trendy designs at an affordable price. The ban initially left a vacuum in the Indian market which was later filled by many local players. Experts say that with Shein India, Reliance Retail - owned by Indian billionaire Mukesh Ambani - is diversifying from its existing strategy of selling international brands through its flagship Ajio online retailer. The revival comes with strict conditions that give Reliance Retail full control over its operations and data while Shein will be a technological partner, Goyal told the Indian parliament in December. All customer and application data will be stored in India and Shein will not have any access rights, he said. Goyal also clarified that the app was banned in India, not the ""sale of Shein-branded products"". Shein will use India as a ""supply source for its global operations"" and will help Reliance Retail in ""building the network"" and training Indian garment manufacturers, as it aims to promote export of textile and garments from India, an official from Reliance Retail said. Shein's comeback under the deal with Reliance Retail is a rare exception to India's ban on more than 200 Chinese apps over the last five years. At the time, Indian officials said the ban followed many complaints against the apps for ""stealing and surreptitiously transmitting users' data in an unauthorised manner"". ByteDance's TikTok and popular combat and survival game PlayerUnknown's Battleground (PUBG) were also banned. However PubG was later rebranded and launched for the Indian market under the name Battlegrounds Mobile India (BGMI), which is held by Krafton India.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgyq735wnlo,Dying with dignity: Breaking the taboo around 'living wills' in India,2025-02-03T00:56:52.669Z,Cherylann Mollan,"In 2010, IP Yadev, a surgeon from the southern Indian state of Kerala, was confronted with one of the hardest decisions of his life. He had to decide between keeping his father - a terminal cancer patient - alive, and honouring his wish, expressed verbally, to stop all treatments and put an end to his suffering. Warning: This article contains some distressing details ""As a son, I felt it was my duty to do whatever I could to prolong my father's life. This made him unhappy and he ended up dying alone in an intensive-care unit. The doctor's last efforts to revive him using CPR crushed his ribs. It was a horrible death,"" Dr Yadev says. The experience, he says, deeply impacted him and helped him realise the importance of advance medical directives (AMDs), also known as living wills. A living will is a legal document that allows a person over 18 years to choose the medical care they would want to receive if they develop a terminal illness or condition with no hope of recovery and are unable to make decisions by themselves. For example, they could specify that they don't want to be put on life-support machines or insist that they want to be given adequate pain-relieving medication. In 2018, India's Supreme Court allowed people to draw up living wills and thereby choose passive euthanasia, where medical treatment can be withdrawn under strict guidelines to hasten a person's death. Active euthanasia - any act that intentionally helps a person kill themselves - is illegal in the country. But despite the legal go-ahead, the concept of living wills hasn't really taken off in India. Experts say that this has much to do with the way Indians talk, or rather, don't talk about death. Death is often considered to be a taboo subject and any mention of it is thought to bring bad luck. But there are now efforts underway to change this. In November, Dr Yadev and his team launched India's first programme - at the Government Medical College in Kerala's Kollam district - to educate people about living wills, offering information in person and over the phone. Volunteers also conduct awareness campaigns and distribute will templates. Creating a living will requires family members to have open and honest conversations about death. Despite some resistance, activists and institutions are taking steps to raise awareness, and there's a growing, though cautious, interest. Kerala leads the way in these conversations. Currently, it has the country's best palliative care network, and organisations that offer end-of-life care have also started awareness campaigns around living wills. In March, around 30 people from the Pain and Palliative Care society in Thrissur city signed living wills. Dr E Divakaran, founder of the society, says that the gesture is aimed at make the idea more popular among people. ""Most people have never heard of the term so they have many questions, like whether such a directive can be misused or if they can make changes to their wills later on,"" Mr Yadev says, adding that most inquiries have come from people in their 50s and 60s. ""Right now, it's the educated, upper-middle class that's making use of the facility. But with grassroot awareness campaigns, we're expecting the demographic to widen,"" he says. According to the Supreme Court order, a person must draft the will, sign it in the presence of two witnesses, and have it attested by a notary or gazetted officer. A copy of the will must then be submitted to a state government-appointed custodian. While the guidelines exist on paper, many state governments are yet to set up mechanisms to implement them. This is what Dr Nikhil Datar, a gynaecologist from Mumbai city, realised when he made his living will two years ago as there was no custodian to whom he could submit it. So he went to court and it resulted in the Maharashtra government appointing about 400 officials across local bodies in the state to serve as custodians of living wills. In June, Goa state implemented the Supreme Court's orders around living wills and a high court judge became the first person in the state to register one. On Saturday, Karnataka state ordered district health officers to nominate people to serve on a key medical board required to certify living wills. [Two medical boards have to certify that a patient meets necessary criteria for the implementation of a living will before medical practitioners can act on it.] Mr Datar is also advocating for a centralised digital repository for living wills, accessible nationwide. He has also made his own will available for free on his website as a template. He believes a will helps prevent problems for both families and doctors when a patient is in a vegetative state and beyond recovery. ""Very often, family members don't want the person to endure more treatment but because they can't care for the patient at home, they keep them in the hospital. Doctors, bound by medical ethics, can't withhold treatment, so the patient ends up suffering with no way to express their wishes,"" Mr Datar says. Living wills aren't just about choosing passive euthanasia. Dr Yadev recalls a case where a person wanted his will to specify that he should be placed on life support if his condition ever required it. ""He explained that his only child was living abroad and that he didn't want to die until his son got to meet him,"" Mr Yadev says. ""You have the freedom to choose how you want to die. It is one of the greatest rights available to us, so why not exercise it?"" he says. Healthcare advocates say that conversations around palliative care are slowly growing in the country, giving an impetus to living wills. Dr Sushma Bhatnagar of Delhi's All India Institute of Medical Sciences says the hospital is launching a department to educate patients about living wills. ""Ideally, doctors should discuss living wills with patients, but there's a communication gap,"" she says, adding that training doctors for these conversations can help ensure a person dies with dignity. ""Throughout our lives, our choices are coloured by our loved ones' wishes or by what society thinks is right,"" Mr Yadev says. ""At least in death, let us make choices that are in our interest and fully our own."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25k05p1y1o,Tax relief for Indian middle class - but will it boost economy?,2025-02-01T11:14:05.577Z,Archana Shukla,"Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi's coalition government has unveiled its first full-year budget after his party lost an outright majority in parliament last year. Finance minister Nirmala Sitharaman announced measures to counter slowing growth, rising prices and flagging consumption among the middle class in Asia's third-largest economy. After a period of world-beating growth of more than 8%, India is set for its slowest economic expansion in four years as stagnant wages and high food prices hit consumer spending and corporate profits. Here are five key takeaways from India's union budget: In a major relief to millions of taxpayers, the government has raised income tax exemption limits, making earnings of up to 1.2m rupees ($13,841; £11,165) - excluding special rate income like capital gains - entirely tax free. The finance minister has also announced tweaks to other income tax slabs which is likely to leave more money in the hands of the middle class. The income tax concessions to the middle class ""seems aimed at addressing the slump in urban consumption"", said Nomura's India Economist Aurodeep Nandi. The impact, however, could be limited since a tiny fraction of Indians pay direct taxes. In 2023, 1.6% of Indians (22.4 million people) actually paid income taxes, according to data presented in parliament. The market cheered the announcements with stocks of automobiles, consumer goods and online grocery companies rallying. State-funded capital expenditure on major road, port and railway projects has been a key driver of India's growth engine since 2020. Despite an unexpected contraction in actual spending in the first nine months of this year, the government has modestly increased its infrastructure expenditure target for this year from 11.1 trillion to 11.2 trillion rupees ($129.18bn; £104.21bn). The government has also proposed offering interest-free loans to states to enable them to spend more on infrastructure development. The budget has set a goal to generate 100GW of nuclear energy by 2047. As part of this plan, a Nuclear Energy Mission has been launched with a budget of 200bn rupees ($2.3bn, £1.86bn). The plan is to deploy five indigenous reactors by 2033 and amend laws, like the Civil Liability for Nuclear Damage Act, to realise goals and get more private sector participation in the sector. Meanwhile, foreign direct investment limits for the insurance sector have been increased from 74% to 100%. ""This will aid foreign insurers' interest in investing in the growing Indian insurance market, where we expect strong premium growth to boost profitability,"" said Mohammed Ali Londe, Senior analyst at Moody's Ratings. In order to ease the climate for doing business, which has been a major concern among investors, a high-level committee has been announced to undertake regulatory reforms in the non-financial sectors and reduce the compliance burden on corporations. The panel will make recommendations within a year. Small and micro industries, that account for 35% of India's manufacturing and create millions of jobs, also got a boost through fiscal support of 1.5 trillion rupees ($17.31bn; £13.96bn) over the next five years. The government has also raised production-linked subsidies and slashed import duties for local manufacturing units across sectors like textiles, mobile telephones and electronics. This could promote private investments, which have not picked up post the Covid-19 pandemic. Even with slightly higher budget outlays for infrastructure creation, India has had to continue a delicate balancing act between pushing economic growth and keeping its spending in check. The budget has reiterated a commitment to reducing the government's deficit, which is the gap between what it earns and spends, to 4.4% by 2026 from 4.8% this year. Global rating agencies closely watch these numbers, with lower debt figures leading to potentially better investment ratings in the future and a reduction in borrowing costs for the country. India's recent slowdown has made the growth versus fiscal prudence trade-off increasingly challenging. A recent economic survey by the finance ministry expects GDP growth to slow to between 6.3-6.8% in the financial year ending March 2026, in line with the Reserve Bank of India's forecasts. With the budget out of the picture, the focus will now shift to the central bank's monetary policy meeting later this month. The RBI has maintained policy rates at 6.5% since February 2023, but is likely to begin easing the cost of borrowing as both growth and inflation have begun to come down. Last week, the central bank announced plans to inject $18bn into the domestic banking system to ease a cash shortage, a move seen by many as a precursor to rate cuts.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3dx1yzzerlo,Yang Tengbo: Who is alleged Chinese spy linked to Prince Andrew?,2025-01-31T19:38:49.871Z,Frances Mao,"Yang Tengbo has been identified as the 50-year-old Chinese businessman and alleged spy banned from the UK. UK authorities have alleged he formed an ""unusual degree of trust"" with Prince Andrew and developed relationships with politicians to be ""leveraged"" by China. Details of the allegations against Mr Yang came to light in December when a Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac) upheld a Home Office order banning him from the UK on national security grounds following a long-running legal battle. Mr Yang had previously only been identified as H6 - at his own request the order suppressing his identity was lifted. He has said the allegation he is a spy is ""entirely untrue"" and denied doing anything unlawful. Yang Tengbo, also known as Chris Yang, was born in Chuxiong, a small city in south-western Chinese province of Yunnan in 1974. He graduated from Yunnan University in Chinese literature and spent seven years as a civil servant as a junior official, he told the Siac court. He eventually realised he needed to gain more knowledge about public administration and management, which led him to study abroad, he said in the interview. Mr Yang first came to the UK in 2002 and studied in London for a year to learn English, before taking a masters degree in public administration and public policy at the University of York. He told the Siac court he had once been a member of the Chinese Communist Party but allowed his membership to lapse after moving to the UK. In 2005 he founded consultancy firm Hampton Group International - one of five companies he has been publicly listed as a director of in the UK. On 21 May 2013 he was granted indefinite leave to remain in the UK. He told the tribunal that he spent up to two weeks in the UK each month on average prior to the pandemic. According to Chinese media reports, Mr Yang, who is also executive chairman of UK Chinese Business Association, has served as a ""bridge"" between businesses in both countries, helping companies access each other's markets. After his identity was disclosed, he described the UK as his ""second home"" and said he ""would never do anything to harm"" it. Like many successful figures in China, he is also involved in official events associated with the government. In recent years, he has attended meetings held by the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, an advisory body central to the country's United Front system, where he has voiced support for China's economic and international standing as an overseas community representative. On 6 November 2021, Mr Yang was stopped at the UK border for reasons which have not been made public. He surrendered his phone and other digital devices. In February 2022, he filed a legal claim to stop the UK government from retaining his data - a bid he first won and then lost on appeal. He was then told UK authorities believed he was associated with the United Front Work Department (UFWD) - the arm of the Chinese government that organises Beijing's cultural influence operations. The UFWD has been linked to several cases of alleged Chinese state interference in Western countries and researchers say it often works to try to co-opt legitimate Chinese business and community groups in foreign countries. A year later, Mr Yang was ""off-boarded"" from a flight to London as he was returning from Beijing. He was told the UK was in the process of making a decision to bar him. Mr Yang's lawyers asked the government to disclose the allegations against him and for an opportunity to make his case. On 15 March 2023, then Home Secretary Suella Braverman ordered the cancellation of Mr Yang's residency rights. She banned him from the UK because it would be ""conducive to the public good"". Mr Yang was informed of this on 23 March 2023 and he launched a legal challenge shortly after. Some of the evidence which informed the Home Office's decision to ban Mr Yang was included in a court ruling upholding the decision published in December. Authorities relied on data found on Mr Yang's devices when he was stopped in 2021, including documents which UK authorities said indicated a link with the UFWD and other Beijing-linked groups. UK authorities argued these showed he was ""frequently connected to officials connected with the Chinese state"". They also said he had ""sometimes deliberately obscured"" his links to the Chinese government, the Chinese Communist Party and the UFWD, and alleged there was a ""deceptive element"" to his account. The Home Office also argued that even though Mr Yang said he hadn't received direct orders to interfere with UK interests, ""those in his position could be expected to understand UFWD and CCP objectives"" and ""proactively engage in them without being tasked"". They also pointed to Mr Yang's membership of the London-based 48 Group Club, which promotes trade between the UK and China. Security officials argued Mr Yang's honorary membership could be leveraged for political interference purposes by Beijing. In a response to the US-funded Radio Free Asia, the 48 Group Club said Mr Yang was never actively involved the running of the group. While the tribunal ruled there was not an ""abundance"" of evidence against Mr Yang in some instances, and said there may be an ""innocent explanation"" in others, it ultimately decided there was ""sufficient"" material to justify MI5's conclusion that he posed a security risk. Mr Yang said he will appeal against the ruling. Watch: 'China's Magic Weapon', a 2021 documentary on China's efforts to expand its influence in the West. Mr Yang first met the Duke of York in 2014 after being introduced by the prince's then private secretary, Amanda Thirsk. He attended a St James's Palace dinner to celebrate Chinese entrepreneurs in the UK before becoming involved with Pitch@Palace, a project set up by the prince to support entrepreneurs. Mr Yang is recognised as a key figure in launching its Chinese version - Pitch@Palace China - which also won backing from the Chinese government. UK authorities discovered a letter from Dominic Hampshire, a senior adviser to Prince Andrew, who said Mr Yang could act on behalf of the prince in engagements with potential investors in China. Mr Hampshire also told Mr Yang in a letter: ""Outside of [the prince's] closest internal confidants, you sit at the very top of a tree that many, many people would like to be on."" It is unclear if this was a true assertion put forward by Mr Hampshire, who has not spoken publicly since being named in the ruling. But the Home Office assessed this as evidence that Mr Yang was in a position to ""generate relationships between prominent UK figures and senior Chinese officials"" which ""could be leveraged for political interference purposes"" by Beijing. Prince Andrew said he ""ceased all contact"" with Mr Yang after receiving advice from the government, but did not specify when communication stopped. His office said they met ""through official channels"" and there was ""nothing of a sensitive nature ever discussed"". In another display of the Mr Yang's friendship with the prince, documents from the court case - disclosed to the media on Friday - show Mr Hampshire privately admitted to the Chinese businessman that the duke's BBC Newsnight interview addressing his links to sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein had been ""ill advised"". Prince Andrew's aide also thanked Mr Yang for standing by the duke. The letter written in March 2020 on official Buckingham Palace notepaper added: ""Under your guidance, we found a way to get the relevant people unnoticed in and out of the house of Windsor. ""We orchestrated a very powerful verbal message of support to China at a Chinese New Year's dinner and between the three of us, we have written, amended and then always agreed a number of letters at the highest level possible."" Mr Yang told the Siac court he never had any private meeting with the duke without his staff present and never had direct access to him by phone or email. Mr Yang has strongly denied the allegations against him. According to papers disclosed on Friday, Mr Yang told the Siac court although he was once a member of the Chinese Communist Party he had never been directed to interfere in British interests. In further submissions, he also said he only had limited links to the Chinese state and that ""contact with the UFWD is unavoidable"". Mr Yang said he had become a victim of a new political climate in which the UK has hardened its views towards China. Mr Yang told the Siac court he ""admired and respected"" the duke for how he had supported Chinese entrepreneurs and all meeting occurred with the knowledge of Buckingham Palace. In a fresh statement on 31 January, Mr Yang said the allegations against him were ""entirely unfounded and I have done nothing wrong"". He said he is seeking to overturn the UK court's decision to refuse his appeal and described the UK's dealings with China as ""inconsistent and erratic"". ""The inherent unfairness of the [court] process means I am unable to know all the allegations and evidence against me,"" he said. ""As a self-made entrepreneur, I have built a successful career facilitating trade and investment between the UK and China. ""I was educated at a British university, I'm a UK taxpayer, and my activities have led to significant investment and job creation in the UK. ""Stories of entrepreneurial success like this should be encouraged and celebrated, not punished."" A Beijing foreign ministry spokesperson said in December ""it is not worth refuting this kind of unjust hype"", adding to a statement last week which said ""some individuals in the UK are always eager to fabricate baseless 'spy' stories targeting China"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly9d4n1rgmo,'Key lessons' for conservation as India's tiger population doubles in a decade,2025-01-31T11:22:09.663Z,Soutik Biswas,"India now hosts the world's largest tiger population, despite having the highest human density and just 18% of global tiger habitat, according to a new study. In just over a decade, India has doubled its tiger population to more than 3,600, accounting for 75% of the world's tigers. These tigers now inhabit an area of 138,200 sq km (53,360 sq miles) - roughly half the size of the UK - alongside some 60 million people. This has been made possible by safeguarding the big cats from poaching and habitat loss, securing prey, reducing human-wildlife conflict, and uplifting local communities, the study published in Science, a leading peer-reviewed research journal, says. ""We think human densities are detrimental to conservation of large carnivores [like tigers]. But more than density it is the attitude of people that matters,"" Yadvendradev Vikramsinh Jhala, the study's lead author, told the BBC. He cited Malaysia as an example, where, despite being economically prosperous and having a lower population density than India, tiger populations have not been successfully revived. India's tiger recovery shows how conservation can protect big cats, boost biodiversity, and support communities - offering key lessons for the world, the researchers believe. The study by Mr Jhala, Ninad Avinash Mungi, Rajesh Gopal and Qamar Qureshi analysed tiger occupancy in India from 2006 to 2018. Since 2006, India has surveyed tiger habitats every four years across 20 states, monitoring distribution of the big cats, co-predators, prey, and quality of habitat. In that time, its tiger habitat has grown by 30% - about 2,929 sq km annually. But while tigers in the country have thrived in protected, prey-rich areas, they have also adapted to landscapes shared by nearly 60 million people, primarily living in farming communities and settlements outside tiger reserves and national parks. The level of coexistence with tigers varies across India, influenced by economics, social settings, and cultural factors, the researchers found. In states like Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, Uttarakhand, and Karnataka, tigers share space with people at high densities.  In regions with a history of bushmeat hunting or poaching, such as Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, and northeast India, tigers are either absent or extinct. These areas also include some of India's poorest districts. In other words, researchers note, tiger coexistence with people is often found in economically prosperous areas, which benefit from tiger-related tourism and government compensation for conflict losses. But development can be a ""double-edged sword"", says Mr Jhala. The researchers say economic prosperity through sustainable use of ecosystems helps recovery of tigers. However, it often leads to changes in land use that harm tiger habitats. ""Tiger recovery is thus constrained at opposite ends of the socioeconomic spectrum, by intensive urbanisation and poverty,"" the researchers say. ""Hence, adopting an inclusive and sustainable rural prosperity in place of an intensive land-use change–driven economy can be conducive for tiger recovery, aligning with India's modern environmentalism and sustainability."" Armed conflict also significantly increases risk of extinction of tigers, the researchers found. Globally, political instability has led to drastic wildlife declines, as militants exploit wildlife for funding, turning lawless areas into poaching hotspots. In India, Manas National Park lost its rhinos during conflict, mirroring Nepal's rhino decline during the civil unrest. The researchers found tiger extinctions occurred in districts impacted by India's Maoist conflict, particularly in tiger reserves in Chhattisgarh and Jharkhand. Reserves where the conflict has been controlled - Nagarjunsagar-Srisailam, Amrabad, and Similipal - have shown recovery, they say. Also, several habitats in Odisha, Chhattisgarh, Jharkhand, Telangana, Andhra Pradesh, and eastern Maharashtra have faced armed insurgencies, resulting in low tiger occupancy and high extinction risk, the researchers found. ""With improved political stability, these areas may see tiger recovery,"" they say. India's tiger-free habitats - some 157,000 sq km - are mainly in Chhattisgarh, Odisha, and Jharkhand. Reintroducing tigers and enhancing habitat connectivity in protected areas could restore around 10,000 sq km in these areas, the researcher say. Recovering large carnivores in crowded, poverty-stricken areas is challenging, researcher say. One approach, land sparing, suggests keeping people separate from predators. The other, land sharing supports coexistence between humans and wildlife. Critics argue land sharing leads to conflict, while land sparing may be impractical. The study shows that both approaches - land sparing and land sharing - are necessary for tiger recovery in India, as each has a ""role in conserving large carnivores"". India is also grappling with rising human-wildlife conflict, leading to fatalities from tiger attacks. How does this align with the growing tiger population? ""We lose 35 people to tiger attacks every year, 150 to leopards, and the same number to wild pigs. Additionally, 50,000 people die from snake bites. And then about 150,000 also lose their lives in car accidents annually,"" says Mr Jhala. ""It's not about the number of deaths. Two hundred years ago, human deaths from predators were a normal part of mortality. Today, they're abnormal, which is why they make the headlines. In fact, within tiger reserves, you're more likely to die from a car accident than from a tiger attack."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c99y7mjne54o,Families mourn loved ones who died in Kumbh Mela crush,2025-01-31T07:53:15.398Z,Cherylann Mollan,"Families of people who were killed in a crush at a major religious festival in northern India this week are grieving their loss and waiting to take bodies of their relatives back home. At least 30 people died in the crush at the Kumbh Mela on Wednesday, which was one of the holiest days of the six-week long Hindu festival. The incident took place in Prayagraj city near the Sangam, an auspicious meeting point of the sacred Ganges, Yamuna and mythical Saraswati rivers where devotees take a dip. The festival, billed as the largest gathering of humanity, attracts tens of millions of pilgrims from around the world. Warning: The story has details that some readers may find distressing The crush reportedly took place after a surge of pilgrims making their way to the Sangam trampled over devotees sleeping near the riverbank. Eyewitnesses have blamed the police and festival authorities for poor crowd-control measures and not making adequate space for pilgrims to move to their destinations. The government in Uttar Pradesh state has launched a judicial investigation into the incident. Meanwhile, the families of the victims are mourning the loss of their loved ones and some say that many of their questions remain unanswered. Others are still waiting for news of their relatives. Kaikeyi Devi, who travelled from Bihar state with her husband to attend the Kumbh Mela, says she can't shake the image of him getting trampled in front of her eyes. ""He was dragged in the chaos and we started crying… 'Let him free! Let him be! We are here!'...but he never came [back],"" Ms Devi told Reuters news agency as she waited outside a mortuary in Prayagraj city to collect her husband's body. Taposh Roy, a resident of Assam state who lost his brother in the crush, recounts the delay in getting help from authorities. ""He was just lying there for a long time because there was no ambulance to take him to the hospital. We pleaded with the police saying that we would carry him ourselves but they told us to wait. When he was taken by police, we couldn't go with him,"" Mr Roy told the Indian Express newspaper. This was also the experience of Tarun Bose from West Bengal state who lost a female relative in the crush. ""The authorities failed to rescue her and the police only managed to retrieve her body after an hour and a half. There were no police officers around during the accident,"" he told AFP news agency. Deepak Hattarwat from Karnataka state is mourning the loss of his wife and daughter. He didn't travel to the festival and says that he found out about their deaths only a day later and that too from a fellow traveller in their group. ""We were planning her [the daughter's] wedding. What should I do and for whom should I live now?"" Mr Hattarwat told the Indian Express newspaper. Meanwhile, some people say that they are still searching for their loved ones, more than 48 hours after the incident took place. Manoj Kumar Sahni from Bihar state told Reuters news agency that he has been desperately searching for his father who is missing. ""I have been searching for him since the last three days. I went to the hospital as well but didn't find him. We also searched at the railway station and the bus stand but did not find him,"" he said. Since the incident, authorities have stepped up security measures in the festival and have also banned vehicles from entering the mela grounds until 4 February. The next auspicious bathing day is on Monday, when the festival is expected to witness massive crowds."

Videos show chaotic scenes with bodies on the streets after the crowd fled the rally in Bukavu, the second-biggest city in the east, in panic. Casualty figures are unclear, but AFP news agency has quoted a hospital source as saying that at least 11 people have been killed and 60 others are wounded. This was the first rally that the Rwanda-backed rebels were holding in Bukavu since taking the city from government forces earlier this month following a rapid advance through the region.  The rebels accused President Felix Tshisekedi's government of orchestrating the attack. However, Tshisekedi blamed it on ""a foreign army"" that he said was operating in the east. The rally had earlier been addressed by Corneille Nangaa, the head of the alliance of rebel groups that includes the Rwanda-backed M23. He promised the crowd that the rebels would bring safety and security to the city. ""There will be special units and patrols that will take place in all the communes,"" he was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. It is believed that Nangaa and Bertrand Bisimwa of M23 had already left when the attack took place at Bukavu's main square. In a statement, Nangaa said that two people had been apprehended in connection with the attack, and a search was under way for other suspects. ""This cowardly and barbaric act will not go without consequences,"" he said. The rebels have been advancing through eastern DR Congo since January, seizing Bukavu and Goma, the biggest city in the region. The fighting has forced about 500,000 people from their homes, worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis, according to the UN. The African Union and the UN have called for a ceasefire and for the rebels to withdraw from areas they now control. Rwanda used to deny backing the M23, but recently it has adopted a more defensive line, saying fighting near the border between DR Congo and Rwanda is a threat to its security. UN experts have previously estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops are in eastern DR Congo. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

Journalists from across Africa are invited to apply for the award, which aims to uncover and promote fresh talent from the continent. The winner will spend three months at the BBC headquarters in London, gaining skills and experience. Applications close on 20 March 2025 at 23:59 GMT. The award honours the legacy of Komla Dumor, a distinguished Ghanaian broadcaster and former BBC World News presenter, who died suddenly aged 41 11 years ago. Dumor's widow, Kwansema Dumor, said she was ""proud"" of her husband's impact at the BBC, and also said her family were ""thankful to the BBC for remembering him"" through the prize. The BBC is encouraging journalists from across Africa to apply for the prize, which seeks to promote and celebrate outstanding journalistic talent on the continent. As well as receiving training, the successful candidate will have the opportunity to travel to a country in Africa to report on a story that they have researched, with the report broadcast to the BBC's global audiences. Known for championing robust, dynamic journalism, Dumor made a significant impact on Africa and the rest of the world. The BBC is committed to continuing his legacy through the award by empowering journalists from Africa to tell original and nuanced African stories to international audiences. Rukia Bulle from Kenya was last year's winner. During her placement, she travelled to a Senegalese village to report on the Baye Fall, an unorthodox Muslim minority who are often misunderstood by others in the wider faith. Jonathan Munro, BBC News global director and deputy CEO, said: ""We are proud to launch this year's BBC News Komla Dumor award and the search for the next recipient. ""Marking its 10th anniversary is a testament to Komla Dumor's powerful legacy of reporting on African stories with depth, insight and integrity. ""Past winners of the award reflect the exceptional talent across the continent so I look forward to welcoming this year's winner and strongly encourage journalists to apply."" Dumor was the presenter of Focus on Africa, the BBC's first-ever dedicated daily TV news programme in English for African audiences. It was broadcast on BBC World News, which has now merged with the BBC News Channel to create a single 24-hour TV news service. He was also one of the lead presenters for BBC World News' European morning segment. He joined the BBC in 2007 after a decade of broadcast journalism in his native Ghana where he won the Ghana Journalist of the Year award.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2eyqz49v5o,The 'hero' ship fixing Africa's internet blackouts - the BBC goes aboard,2025-02-27T00:39:31.213Z,Daniel Dadzie,"A ship the size of a football field, crewed by more than 50 engineers and technicians, cruises the oceans around Africa to keep the continent online. It provides a vital service, as last year's internet blackout showed when internet cables buried deep under the sea were damaged. Millions from Lagos to Nairobi were plunged into digital darkness: messaging apps crashed and banking transactions failed. It left businesses and individuals struggling. It was the Léon Thévenin which fixed the multiple cable failures. The ship, where a BBC team recently spent a week on board off the coast of Ghana, has been doing this specialised repair work for the last 13 years ""Because of me, countries stay connected,"" Shuru Arendse, a cable jointer from South Africa who has been working on the ship for more than a decade, tells the BBC. ""IT people at home have work because I bring the main feed in,"" he says. ""You have heroes that save lives - I'm a hero because I save communication."" His pride and passion reflect the sentiment of the skilled crew on the Léon Thévenin, which stands eight floors high and carries an assortment of equipment. The internet is a network of computers servers - to read this article it is likely that at least one of 600 fibre optic cables across the world collected the data to present it on your screen. Most of these servers are in data centres outside of Africa and the fibre optic cables run along the ocean floor linking them to coastal cities on the continent. Data travels through hair-thin fibreglass wires, often grouped in pairs and protected by different layers of plastic and copper depending on how close the cables are to the shore. ""As long as the servers aren't in the country, you need a connection. A cable runs from one country to the next, linking users to servers that store their data - whether it's accessing Facebook or any other online service,"" says Benjamin Smith, the Léon Thévenin's deputy chief of mission. Undersea fibre optic cables are designed to work for 25 years with minimal maintenance, but when they are damaged, it is usually due to human activity. ""The cable generally doesn't break on its own unless you're in an area where there are pretty high currents and very sharp rocks,"" says Charles Heald, who is in charge of the ship's remotely operated vehicle (ROV). ""But most of the time it's people anchoring where they shouldn't and fishing trawlers sometimes scrape along the seabed, so typically we would see scars from trawling."" Mr Smith also says natural disasters cause damage to cables, especially in parts of the continent with extreme weather conditions. He gives an example of the seas off the coast of the Democratic Republic of Congo, where the Congo River empties into the Atlantic. ""In the Congo Canyon, where they have a lot of rainfall and low tide, it could create currents that damage the cable,"" he says. Deliberate sabotage is difficult to identify - but the Léon Thévenin crew say they not seen any obvious evidence of this themselves. A year ago, three critical cables in the Red Sea - Seacom, AAE-1 and EIG - were severed, reportedly by a ship's anchor, disrupting connectivity for millions across East Africa, including Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda and Mozambique. Just a month later, in March 2024, a separate set of breaks in the Wacs, Ace, Sat-3, and MainOne cables off the coast of West Africa caused severe internet blackouts across Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Liberia. Anything that required the internet to function felt the strain as repairs stretched on for weeks. Then in May, yet another setback: the Seacom and Eassy cables suffered damage off the coast of South Africa, hitting connectivity in multiple East African nations once again. Such faults are detected by testing electricity and signal strength transmitted through cables. ""There may be 3,000 volts in a cable and suddenly it drops to 50 volts, this means there's a problem,"" explains Loic Wallerand, the ship's chief of mission. There are local teams with the capacity to deal with faults in shallow waters, but if they are detected beyond a depth of 50m (164ft), the ship is called into action. Its crew can fix cables deeper than 5,000m below sea level. The repair witnessed by the BBC off Ghana took over a week to deal with, but most internet users did not notice as traffic was redirected to another cable. The nature of every repair depends on the part of the cable that is damaged. If the fibreglass at the core breaks, it means the data cannot travel along the network and needs to be sent to another cable. But some African countries have only one cable serving them. This means a cable damaged this way leaves the affected area without the internet. At other times, the protective layers of the fibre could be damaged, meaning data transmission still occurs, but with a lower efficiency. In both cases, the crew must find the exact location of the damage. In the case of broken fibreglass, a light signal is sent through the cable and through its point of reflection, the crew can determine where the break is. When the problem is with the cable's insulation - known as a ""shunt fault"" - it becomes more complicated and an electrical signal has to be sent along the cable to physically track where it is lost. After narrowing down the possible area for the fault, the operation moves to the ROV team. Built like a bulldozer, the ROV, weighing 9.5 tonnes, is lowered under water from the ship where it is guided down to the ocean floor. About five crew members work with a crane operator to deploy it - once it is released from its harness, called the umbilical cord, it floats gracefully. ""It doesn't sink,"" says Mr Heald, explaining how it uses four horizontal and vertical thrusters to move in any direction. The ROV's three cameras allow the team onboard to look for the precise location of faults as it moves to the ocean bed. Once found, the ROV cuts the affected part using its two arms, then ties it to a rope that is dragged back to the ship. Here the faulty section is isolated and replaced by splicing and joining it to a new cable - a process that looks like welding and which took 24 hours in the case of the operation witnessed by the BBC. Afterwards the cable was carefully lowered back to the ocean bed and then the ROV made one final journey to inspect that it was well placed and take coordinates so maps could be updated. When an alert is received about a damaged cable, the Léon Thévenin crew is ready to sail within 24 hours. However, their response time depends on several factors: the ship's location, the availability of spare cables and bureaucratic challenges. ""Permits can take weeks. Sometimes we sail to the affected country and wait offshore until the paperwork is sorted,"" Mr Wallerand says. On the average, the crew spends more than six months at sea every year. ""It's part of the job,"" says Captain Thomas Quehec. But talking to the crew members between tasks, it is hard to ignore their personal sacrifices. They are drawn from different backgrounds and nationalities: French, South African, Filipino, Malagasy and more. Adrian Morgan, the ship's chief steward from South Africa, has missed five consecutive wedding anniversaries. ""I wanted to quit. It was difficult to stay away from my family, but my wife encouraged me. I do it for them,"" he says. Another South African, maintenance fitter Noel Goeieman, is worried he may miss his son's wedding in a few weeks if the ship is called out to another mission. ""I've heard we might go to Durban [in South Africa]. My son is going to be very sad because he doesn't have a mum,"" says Mr Goeieman, who lost his wife three years ago. ""But I'm retiring in six months,"" he adds with a smile. Despite the emotional toll, there is camaraderie onboard. When off-duty, crew members are either playing video games in the lounge or sharing meals in the ship's mess hall. Their entry into the profession is as diverse as their background. While Mr Goeieman followed his father's footsteps, chief cook, South African Remario Smith, went to sea to escape a life of crime. ""I was involved in gangs when I was younger,"" Mr Smith says, ""My child was born when I turned 25, and I knew I had to change my life."" Like the others onboard he is appreciative of the role the ship plays on the continent. ""We are the link between Africa and the world,"" says chief engineer Ferron Hartzenberg.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8y5j49xgyo,"UK suspension of aid is 'punitive', Rwanda says",2025-02-26T12:51:01.462Z,Wedaeli Chibelushi,"The UK's decision to suspend some aid to Rwanda is ""punitive"", authorities in the East African country have said. In a statement, the UK said it was against Rwanda's support for the M23, a rebel group that has captured swathes of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo in a deadly uprising. Rwanda used to deny backing the M23, but recently it has adopted a more defensive line, saying fighting near the border between DR Congo and Rwanda is a threat to its security. More than 7,000 people have died and hundreds of thousands have fled their homes since the conflict escalated in January, DR Congo's government says. The UK said the humanitarian situation in DR Congo was ""critical"" and that it would halt bilateral aid to Rwanda, ""excluding support to the poorest and most vulnerable"". Earlier this month, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said Rwanda receives about £32m ($40m) of bilateral aid from the UK every year. Along with the suspension of aid, the UK will impose other measures, such as looking into potential sanctions and suspending ""future defence training assistance"", the statement said. These measures will last until ""significant progress"" is made in ceasing hostilities and withdrawing Rwandan military personnel from DR Congo, it added. UN experts have previously estimated that between 3,000 and 4,000 Rwandan troops are in eastern DR Congo. Rwanda's foreign ministry said the ""punitive measures"" announced by the UK government ""in response to the conflict in eastern DRC - where the UK has now clearly chosen a side - are regrettable"". ""The measures do nothing to help the Democratic Republic of Congo, nor do they contribute to achieving a sustainable political solution to the conflict in eastern DRC."" The UK has previously enjoyed good relations with Rwanda. In 2022, the two countries signed a multi-million pound deal, in which some asylum seekers arriving on British soil would be deported to Rwanda. The deal faced legal challenges and was scrapped last year after a change in the UK's government. DR Congo's government has been campaigning for international powers to suspend aid and impose sanctions on Rwanda. Last week, the US Treasury Department said it had imposed sanctions on Rwanda's Minister of State for Regional Integration, James Kabarebe. The US accused Kabarebe, a former army chief, of being central to Rwanda's support for M23. Also sanctioned was Lawrence Kanyuka, the M23's spokesman, as well as two companies he controlled in France and the UK, the US Treasury said. Responding to the US move, Rwanda's foreign ministry said the sanctions were ""unjustified"". The M23 says it is fighting to achieve better rights for the Tutsis, an ethnic minority group in DR Congo, and to bring order to a failed state.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyn914g249o,Sudan military plane crashes in residential area,2025-02-26T11:54:00.146Z,Basillioh Rukanga,"At least 46 people have been killed and 10 others injured after a Sudanese military plane crashed in a residential neighbourhood in Omdurman, the twin city of the capital Khartoum, state media says. The Antonov aircraft came down after take-off from the military's Wadi Seidna air base on Tuesday evening, killing military officers and civilians. The cause of the crash is unclear, but military sources have been quoted as saying that it was likely to have been a technical malfunction. The crash came a day after the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) - which is at war with the army - said it had downed a fighter jet in South Darfur. The conflict has devastated large parts of Sudan - including Khartoum and Omdurman - with thousands of people killed and about 12 million displaced. The health ministry said that emergency teams rushed injured civilians, including children, to a nearby hospital following Tuesday's plane crash. A senior army commander in Khartoum was among those killed, Reuters news agency quoted unnamed military sources as saying. Witnesses said there was a loud explosion and several homes were damaged when the plane came down, the AFP news agency reports. The crash also caused power outages in nearby neighbourhoods, it added. Sudan has been hit by a civil war since April 2023, when the army and the RSF became involved in a vicious power struggle. The war has split the country, with the army controlling the north and the east while the RSF holds most of the Darfur region in the west and parts of the south. In recent weeks, the army has retaken parts of Khartoum and surrounding areas from the RSF. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2gn417300o,'They took all the women here': Rape survivors recall horror of DR Congo jailbreak,2025-02-25T17:38:48.519Z,Orla Guerin,"Warning: This article contains distressing content, including descriptions of rape, from the start. ""He told me that if I tried to escape, he would kill me."" Pascaline, 22, recalls the words of her rapist at a prison in Goma, the largest city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, in the early hours of 27 January. ""I was forced to let it happen instead of losing my life,"" Pascaline tells the BBC. He was the second man to rape her at Munzenze prison. The first attack was so violent that she passed out. Her attackers came over the wall from the men's block right next door called ""Safina"", she says. ""We heard a noise as they jumped on the water tanks. There were so many of them, and we were so scared. The ones who were unlucky were raped. The ones who were lucky got out without being raped."" Chaos was spreading through the jail, and the surrounding city. Rwandan-backed M23 rebels were closing in on Goma, after a rapid advance through the region. Most of the prison guards and the city authorities had already fled. Shooting could be heard outside the jail. Hours later, inside the compound, there was a fire - apparently set by male prisoners as they tried to escape. By morning, about 4,000 male inmates had broken out. But few of the women managed to get away. A total of 132 female prisoners and at least 25 children burned to death, according to two sources. A UN official told the BBC that ""at least 153 women had perished"", quoting ""reliable sources in the prison"". A month on, Pascaline has come back to the charred shell of the prison complex, where an empty watch tower still stands. She wants to tell her story and is willing to be identified. She is also a voice for the dead. She walks through the main yard of the women's section, glancing at the scorched walls, scattered cooking pots and piles of clothing. Her hand comes to her mouth in wordless horror, and she shakes her head. ""At one point I didn't know what was happening any more,"" she says. ""It was after seeing the others die that I began to pull myself together, I would say that it was God who wanted me to be saved."" Pascaline, an onion seller, wound up behind bars here when her employer accused her of theft. Nadine, 22, has also come back to the prison for the first time. In her mind, she cannot escape it. ""When I sleep at night, everything I've seen here comes back to me. I see the dead again - as many dead bodies as I saw here until I got out. Instead of opening the door, they let us die like animals here.""  Nadine says she was also raped by two men. ""They came with alcohol,"" she tells the BBC. ""They wanted to drug people. They took me by force. They took all the women here."" The BBC cannot verify how many women were raped that night, out of a total of 167 who, sources say, were being held. Nadine is furious at the authorities - for locking her up in the first place over an unpaid debt, she says, and then failing to let her out. ""I don't think that justice can exist in Congo,"" she says. ""I condemn the way the government is running things."" The DR Congo government - more than 1,500km (1,000 miles) away in the capital Kinshasa - is no longer running anything in Goma. The rebels are in full control and are continuing to advance in the east. Among the piles of ash that carpet the prison floor after the fire, there is a tiny pink sandal, which is burnt on one side. Some shiny buttons glitter in the dirt beside it, perhaps from children's clothing. Women prisoners were allowed to keep one of their children in the jail with them. Only two children out of 28 survived the blaze in the prison, according to a source. Child prisoners - held in a separate block - were released earlier in the day. It was not just the smoke and the flames that killed the most vulnerable, according to a detailed account from another survivor aged 38, who does not want to be identified. We are calling her Florence. She says ""children started to die"" when tear gas was fired into the women's section. ""The prison was surrounded by soldiers and police who, instead of coming to put out the fire, were firing bullets and throwing tear gas at us,"" Florence says. ""When the tear gas was dropped on us, the fire became intense. Our eyes tingled as if chilli had been poured into them. There was almost no way to breathe,"" she adds. The fire and the rapes are shrouded in confusion, with all sides eager to blame someone else. Human rights groups say rape is widely used as a weapon of war in DR Congo by both the M23 rebels and government forces. However, in this case, Florence says it was fellow inmates. ""You could see they were prisoners. Some came without shoes. When they climbed onto the roof of the women's prison, they were calling the names of those they knew. And none of the attackers were armed or in uniform."" Florence says she heard ""bullets crackling"" outside the prison from 23:00 onwards, and escaping prisoners were being killed by police outside. ""If a prisoner got out, they shot him. When the bullets were flying, I was on my knees begging God to deliver us from this bad situation."" Some of the prisoners who broke into the women's section were looking for a safer escape route, she says. They breached one of the walls facing the outside - a place where police were not normally stationed. But soon that gap was filled - by the fire. Florence first saw the flames at about 04:00. Then hour after hour, she rushed from body to body. ""People were dying in front of our eyes. I couldn't count them. We tried to revive them by giving them water. Some women were suffocated by the fire, as well as the gas. Some died of heart attacks,"" Florence tells the BBC. She too blames the Congolese authorities for the loss of so many lives. ""The state should have opened the doors when it saw the fire or come and put it out."" The BBC has contacted the government in Kinshasa asking for a response to what the survivors have told us but we have not yet received one. Florence says the women's prison was finally opened at 11:00 - she does not know by who - and she emerged with 18 other survivors. They were offered no help. ""Even the policemen we found on the road, did not ask for news of the prisoners, or ask if anyone had been hurt, or how we were,"" she says. By then rebel fighters were in parts of the city, having entered at around 08:00. Goma was falling. The women did not seem to matter - in or out of prison. In a tent in the grounds of Goma's hospital, we meet another survivor, Sifa, 25, who was pulled from the flames by a friend. She lies on her left side - any other position is too painful. Her right arm is heavily bandaged, and there are burn marks on her arm and her face. She also has burns on her back. When her dressings are changed the nurses have to give her morphine. But her agony is more than physical. Her two-year-old daughter Esther died in the prison. ""I had Esther on my back. When we wanted to escape, something fell on her. A bomb? I don't know what. She died on the spot,"" Sifa tells the BBC. She adds that Esther was just starting to walk and was ""without sin"". Sometimes she would play with the other children in the prison, but mostly she was by her mother's side. How did Sifa, a peanut seller, wind up behind bars in a teeming prison with her daughter? She was accused of involvement in a robbery, which she denies. She says she was jailed without being convicted. Local sources say that is a common occurrence. The full story of what happened in Munzenze Prison may never be known. It seems those in power are in no rush to find out. Sifa and the other survivors we spoke to told us that no-one had contacted them to take their testimony about the horrors of 27 January - not the rebels in control of Goma now, nor the government in Kinshasa who used to run the prison. ""No-one will follow [this case],"" Sifa says. ""No-one will be pursued. It's already over."" Additional reporting from the BBC's Wietske Burema, Göktay Koraltan and Yvonne Katinga.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70ekeln92eo,Tinubu ex-ally criticises Nigeria reforms,2025-02-25T17:19:28.020Z,Mansur Abubakar,"One of the architects of Nigerian President Bola Tinubu's 2023 election victory has criticised the reforms being carried out by his government. In an interview with Arise TV, Nasir El-Rufai said the president's decision to import food to lower prices would impoverish the country's farmers. In response, presidential spokesman Bayo Onanuga said that even though El-Rufai had worked hard for Tinubu's election, it was time for him to move on from the disappointment of not being made a minister. The 65-year-old, one of the founding members of the ruling All Progressives Congress party, was tipped to be one of Tinubu's most influential ministers before his nomination was declined by parliament. ""You don't address food inflation by destroying domestic agriculture,"" said El-Rufai. ""Food prices may be going down, but farmers are being impoverished because they are being made to compete with subsidised agricultural products from Europe and other countries,"" he said. ""I have issues with many of them [Tinubu's policies], and I'm in touch with many senior officials of the administration, and I give them my opinion privately."" The former minister also said his party had abandoned its founding values and internal democracy, warning he might leave if reforms were not made. El-Rufai also said he had supported Tinubu in 2023 not because he was the best but because the 72-year-old was the candidate of his party. ""As a loyal party man, I was duty bound to support the party's candidate,” he noted. He also spoke about his nomination as a minister which was later turned down by the senate over a security report. ""The idea that the National Assembly rejected me is not true. The decision was made by the president himself. Either he changed his mind, or some other factors influenced him. Regardless, I have moved on,"" El-Rufai said. The politician, who has been seen with opposition figures recently, did not rule out moving to another party before the next general elections in 2027.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyj1198wy3o,"Claims of white genocide 'not real', South African court rules",2025-02-25T16:59:07.600Z,Khanyisile Ngcobo,"A South African court has dismissed claims of a white genocide in the country as ""clearly imagined"" and ""not real"", undermining comments made by US President Donald Trump and his adviser Elon Musk. The ruling came as the court blocked a wealthy benefactor's donation to white supremacist group Boerelegioen. Grantland Michael Bray wanted to bequeath $2.1m ( £1.7m) to the group to help it ""further its messages of racial hatred and separation"". But the court ruled this request was invalid, vague and ""contrary to public policy"". Trump has referred to the ""large-scale killing of farmers"" in South Africa, while Musk has condemned what he said were ""racist ownership laws"" and previously condemned the ""genocide of white people"". Despite vowing to crack down on immigration, Trump has said that white South African farmers would be allowed to settle in the US as refugees because of the persecution he said they faced. Musk was born and grew up in South Africa before moving to the US. The court action was brought by Mr Gray's four siblings, who are also trustees and beneficiaries of the family trust. In it, they claimed that their brother had become ""obsessed with the idea of an impending genocide of white people in South Africa"" in the last 10 years of his life. He died in March 2022. Mr Gray, who was paralysed following an accident aged 26 while doing military service, had also become paranoid, believing the supposed ""genocide"" would occur soon. ""That idea was further fuelled by his already present racism and the online content that he was exposed to,"" Judge Rosheni Allie summarised in a 15 February ruling that has just come to light. Mr Gray first met members of the Boerelegioen in 2020 and allegedly gave them about $326,000 (£258,000) in gold coins to help fund their cause and gain membership of the racist group. The Boerelegioen describes itself as a ""civil defence movement that enables citizens to resist the promised slaughter of whites in RSA [Republic of South Africa] as well as the theft of their property"". Mr Gray subsequently made the organisation a beneficiary to his estate, specifying that a portion of the money go towards the various training programmes the group ran. But because there were three entities all bearing the Boerelegioen name, the court found that Mr Gray's bequest made was ""vague concerning which entity was the intended beneficiary"" of his will. ""The only expression of the [Mr Gray's] intention that is evident is the intention for the funds to be used for 'training' as well as [his] own assertions that he wanted the funds used to benefit an organisation which he deemed to be one which will exterminate every black person in South Africa and will be used to defend or ward off a white genocide, which is clearly imagined and not real,"" Judge Allie said. On the public policy issue, Mr Gray's siblings contended that Boerelegioen wanted to use the funds to ""further... its messages of racial hatred and separation"". Boerelegioen says it simply provides security and training services to communities and does not exclude anyone on the basis of race, gender or religion. Judge Allie ruled in favour of the siblings and ordered Boerelegioen to pay the costs in the court case. Earlier this month, Trump signed an executive order freezing financial aid to the country over a new law allowing for land seizures by the South African government under certain circumstances. The status of white South African farmers has long been a rallying cry on the right and far-right of American politics. But despite numerous claims in the past of the systematic targeting of the country's white Afrikaner minority group, local crime statistics figures paint a different picture. South Africa does not release crime figures based on race but the latest figures revealed that 6,953 people were murdered in the country between October and December 2024. Of these, 12 were killed in farm attacks. Of the 12, one was a farmer, while five were farm dwellers and four were employees, who are likely to have been black. In contrast, 961 women were murdered alongside 273 children. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8e7dkld09zo,Uganda probes death of Nigerian footballer in shopping mall,2025-02-25T16:23:51.476Z,Basillioh Rukanga,"Police in Uganda are investigating the death of a Nigerian professional footballer who allegedly fell from a shopping mall in the capital, Kampala. Abubakar Lawal, 29, reportedly fell from a third-floor balcony at the Voicemall Shopping Arcade, where he had gone to visit a Tanzanian friend. He was taken to hospital where he was pronounced dead, the police said. They said Lawal's friend, identified as Omary Naima, had left him in her room - which is part of the mall building - preparing tea before the incident happened. Lawal was a striker playing for local team Vipers Sports Club, which has expressed its sadness for the ""untimely passing of our beloved player"". Tributes have been flowing in for the Nigerian forward, fondly known as ""Man from Sokoto"". He has been with Vipers since July 2022 after a two-year stint with AS Kigali in Rwanda. In 2023, he helped Vipers win the league and cup double. In a post on X, the club said: ""Lawal (Man from Sokoto) was a unique person"". ""He had a big heart of gold. He really cared about people and went out of his way to help. He was incredibly generous."" His former team in Nigeria, Nasarawa United, said: ""We mourn the sudden demise of our ex-player Abubakar Lawal earlier today. May God grant him eternal rest."" Ugandan footballer Mustafa Kizza said he would be forever missed: ""It's hard to take in that you're no more Lawal A kind, talented, jolly, and loving person you have been."" Local media say the matter has left more questions than answers amid conflicting reports over the circumstances of Lawal's death. Some media initially reported that he had died in a motorcycle accident. As a result of such ""contrary information"", Nigeria's authorities should probe the incident, Nigerian international Ahmed Musa said on social media. He added: ""Lawal's soul deserves a thorough investigation and justice must be served if anyone is found guilty."" Police in Uganda said they were already investigating the exact circumstances of the death. ""Authorities are retrieving CCTV footage and conducting thorough interrogations to establish the exact circumstances surrounding the incident,"" police said. The police have retrieved some items belonging to the deceased player, including two smartphones, shoes, headsets and a training kit. ""Further updates will be provided as the investigation progresses,"" the police added. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0kg58xk4dvo,"Regrets, executions and coups: Four takeaways from former Nigerian military ruler's book",2025-02-25T15:41:09.260Z,Mansur Abubakar,"Nigeria's former military ruler Ibrahim Badamasi Babangida, known as IBB, has released a new autobiography including several revelations about the turbulent times while he was in charge of the country from 1985 to 1993. A Journey In Service has got Nigerians talking and reflecting on what might have been if things had turned out differently - especially the controversial decision to annul the 1993 elections, and the execution of a childhood friend. Babangida has a mixed record. While some praise him for the infrastructural development Nigeria he oversaw, others say there was massive corruption during his time. Here are four takeaways from the book: This is the biggest talking-point as it touches on a topic which many believed altered Nigeria's history. Some say the country still has not really recovered from the annulment of the 1993 presidential elections. In the book, Babangida, now 83, for the first time expressed deep regret for cancelling that election. The poll was supposed to bring an end to military rule after 10 years and the cancellation of the outcome threw the country into turmoil. The date of the vote - 12 June - is now remembered in Nigeria as Democracy Day. Moshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the election, was later imprisoned and his wife assassinated. Gen Babangida acknowledged that Abiola, who died in 1998, had won the vote. However, in 1993 as results were being collated, the military government abruptly stopped the process - an action that triggered widespread protests and a political crisis. ""That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret,"" Babangida writes. At the time, he cited the issue of vote-buying, as well as the need to protect the country’s judiciary as reasons for the annulment. Gen Babangida was forced to resign several months later. Nigeria's current President, Bola Tinubu, said at the book launch that Gen Babangida had shown courage by admitting what took place. Abiola’s son Jamiu said the acknowledgment by Gen Babangida that his father had won the election came as a welcome surprise to him and some of his family members. ""Perhaps General Babangida was looking for peace,” he told the BBC Focus on Africa podcast. Civilian rule was eventually restored in 1999, 11 months after the death of another military ruler Gen Sani Abacha. He had seized power towards the end of 1993 in the wake of the annulled elections. General Mamman Vatsa and Babangida grew up together, were in the same class in school and rose alongside each other in the military. His execution in 1986 after he was convicted of a coup plot is another major talking-point of Babangida's presidency. ""We were very close friends,"" Babangida recalls. ""We had grown up together in Minna and had been classmates in Bida. We did several things together as peers. My wife recalled that we used to share a room as bachelors. We would reach out for whatever shirt was available, irrespective of whose it was, and just wear it and head out! We were that close."" However, he says now realises that Vatsa had been jealous since when they were teenagers. ""With the benefit of hindsight now, I recall that a constant part of our relationship as teenagers and young men was a continuous and recurrent peer jealousy on his part towards me. He was always envious of my achievements, especially when he thought I was progressing better than him, either in school or our military career path."" Vatsa and nine others were executed in March 1986. They were said to have planned a coup, which according to Babangida would have plunged the country into darkness. ""I had to choose between saving a friend's life and the nation's future,"" he writes. Another contentious issue has been the 1966 coup which overthrew Nigeria's first government following independence from the UK. Prime Minister Abubakar Tafawa Balewa was killed, along with other high-ranking national and regional leaders. The fact most of the coup plotters were from south-eastern Nigeria meant the coup became known as an ""Igbo coup"" - a label Babangida rejects. He highlighted the role of Major John Obienu, an ethnic Igbo officer, who played a key role in quelling the coup, revealing that many senior Igbo officers were also killed in the mutiny. The book also sheds light on the involvement of members of other ethnic groups, notably Yorubas, many of whom he said had participated in the military takeover. The former leader confirmed that the original intention of the coup plotters was to release politician Obafemi Awolowo from detention and install him as president. Babangida writes: ""It was a terrible time for the Nigerian military. As I have said elsewhere, as a young officer who saw all of this from a distance, probably, ethnic sentiments did not drive the original objective of the coup plotters. ""For instance, the head of the plotters, Major Kaduna Nzeogwu, was only 'Igbo' in name. Born and raised in Kaduna, his immigrant parents were from Okpanam in today's Delta State, which, in 1966, was in the old mid-western region. Nzeogwu spoke fluent Hausa and was as 'Hausa' as any! He and his original team probably thought, even if naively, that they could turn things around for the better in the country."" The association of Igbos with the coup led to attacks on members of that community around the country and ultimately to the civil war in which some Igbo leaders tried to secede from Nigeria in 1967. At least a million people were killed in what became known as the Biafran war. Many Nigerians see Babangida's wife Maryam as the country's most iconic and influential first lady. From 1985 to when they left office in 1993, their love story captivated a lot of people. She died in 2009 and the ex-head of state has never remarried. ""She was stunning. Her ebony beauty set off enchanting eyes, and her dazzling smile showed off a lovely set of teeth; when she smiled - and she often smiled - her face lit up, and her eyes danced,"" he writes. ""We both saw our marriage as our freedom and agreed to sort things out ourselves if we quarrelled. We were very compatible; indeed, I can only recall two occasions on which we quarrelled, and neither of us was afraid to apologise to the other. In all our years of marriage, it was never necessary for anyone to mediate between us over a misunderstanding because of that original meeting of minds. ""I never imagined that Maryam would pass away before I did, but the gift of life is in Allah's hands, not in humanity's. I am grateful for the life Maryam and I shared and for the fruit of our union. Coping without her has not been easy, but it has been made much less demanding by the memories of our life together and the length of her shadow,"" Babangida says. He describes Maryam as a devoted wife, mother, homemaker, and passionate advocate for rural women. Above all, he saw her as a true partner.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy7x87ev5jyo,'People will starve' because of US aid cut to Sudan,2025-02-25T00:16:28.781Z,Barbara Plett Usher & Anne Soy,"The freezing of US humanitarian assistance has forced the closure of almost 80% of the emergency food kitchens set up to help people left destitute by Sudan's civil war, the BBC has learned. Aid volunteers said the impact of President Donald Trump's executive order halting contributions from the US government's development organisation (USAID) for 90 days meant more than 1,100 communal kitchens had shut. It is estimated that nearly two million people struggling to survive have been affected. The conflict between the army and paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has killed tens of thousands of people, forced millions from their homes and left many facing famine since it erupted in April 2023. The kitchens are run by groups known as emergency response rooms, a grassroots network of activists who stayed on the frontlines to respond to the crises in their neighbourhoods. ""People are knocking on the volunteers' doors,"" says Duaa Tariq, one of the emergency room organisers. ""People are screaming from hunger in the streets."" The Trump administration abruptly suspended all US aid last month to determine whether it was ""serving US interests"", and moved to begin dismantling USAID. The State Department has issued an exemption for emergency food assistance, but Sudanese groups and others say there is significant confusion and uncertainty about what that means in practice. The normal channels for processing a waiver through USAID no longer exist, and it is not clear if cash assistance - on which the communal kitchens depend - will be restored, or only goods in-kind. According to some estimates, USAID provided 70-80% of the total funding to these flexible cash programmes. The closure of the majority of Sudan's emergency kitchens is being seen as a significant setback by organisations working to tackle the world's largest hunger crisis, with famine conditions reported in at least five locations. The network of communal feeding centres relied in the early stages of the country's civil war on community and diaspora donations but later became a focal point for funding from international agencies struggling to access the conflict zones, including USAID. It is a ""huge setback"" says Andrea Tracy, a former USAID official who has set up a fund, the Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition, for private donations to the emergency rooms. The former head of USAID, Samantha Power, had embraced the idea of working with the local groups rather than relying only on traditional channels like the UN. Money had started to flow through international aid organisations that got US grants, but a channel for direct funding was in the works. ""It was ground-breaking,"" says Ms Tracy. ""The only time that USAID had ever done this was with the White Helmets [humanitarian group] in Syria."" For Ms Tariq, the cut in US funding made it impossible to buy stock for the more than 25 kitchens in the six neighbourhoods in the capital, Khartoum, she helps to service. She told the BBC that left them unprepared for a worsening situation as the army advanced on the area, which has been held by the RSF since the conflict broke out. There was widespread looting of markets as the RSF began to withdraw and the army tightened its siege. Most of the kitchens had closed, she said. Some are trying to get food on credit from local fishermen and farmers, but very soon ""we expect to see a lot of people starving"". Here and in the rest of the country, Ms Tracy's Mutual Aid Sudan Coalition fund will do what it can to plug the gap left by USAID. ""I think we can shore up [the emergency kitchens],"" she said, ""but the reality is that [private donations] are going to have to do even more now, because even if humanitarian assistance resumes, it's never going to be what it was."" ""These volunteers were challenging us to work differently, and we were responding,"" says a member of a former USAID partner organisation. They are ""exhausted, traumatised and underfunded"" and ""we were scaling up to help them"". The State Department did not answer specific questions about waivers for Sudan, saying that information was shared directly with groups whose applications were successful. ""The aid review process is not about ending foreign aid, but restructuring assistance to ensure it makes the United States safer, stronger, and more prosperous,"" it said in response to a BBC query. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) says it has received waivers for its 13 existing Sudanese grants with USAID, but there is no certainty about what comes next for future funding. That would anyway have been under negotiation - now the talks will take place in changed circumstances. In 2024 the US was the largest single donor to Sudan, both in direct donations and in contributions to the UN's Sudan Humanitarian Response Plan. Top UN officials told the BBC the impact of Washington's policy shift would be felt beyond the borders of Sudan, with more than two million civilians now refugees in neighbouring countries. ""I witnessed people who have fled conflict but not hunger,"" said Rania Dagesh, the WFP's assistant executive director for partnerships and innovation, after visiting camps in Renk and Malakal, South Sudan, earlier this month. The influx of refugees has only strained available meagre resources further. ""We have to rationalise, rationalise, rationalise,"" says Mamadou Dian Balde, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees' regional bureau director. He had also been to visit refugee camps in Chad and Egypt when he spoke to the BBC. ""We are strained. It's extremely difficult."" They both credit the local communities for welcoming those seeking refuge and sharing with them the little that is available. In the case of South Sudan, ""it is a million extra people who've come in to a country where already 60% of the population is in emergency hunger"", says Ms Dagesh. Most families are now down to a meal a day, with children and the elderly given priority. ""But you see them wearing out and thinning in front of you - malnourished children. You see mothers who are trying to breastfeed, and there is nothing coming out of their breast,"" she said. Most of the refugees are women, children and some elderly people. They say most of the able-bodied men were either killed or simply disappeared. So, they fled to save themselves and the children. They have nothing. Faced with the hunger in the camps, some in South Sudan have tried to sell firewood. But Ms Dagesh says it exposes them to harassment, violence and rape. Many of the refugees she met had come from Sudan's agricultural areas. The war disrupted their lives and livelihoods. They would want to see peace restored so they can go back home, but the fighting has been raging for close to two years now with no end in sight. With the hunger situation deteriorating inside Sudan in the absence of a ceasefire, the closure of the kitchens supplying emergency meals will only increase the numbers fleeing across borders. Yet aid agencies that normally would help are strained. The UNHCR says it has been forced to rationalise ""to levels where our interventions are absolutely limited - they are at the minimum"". It does not help that the agency was already underfunded. The UNHCR's call for donor contributions last year yielded only 30% of the anticipated amount, forcing their teams to cut ""everything"", including the number of meals and amount of water refugees could receive. The US has been the UNHCR's main funder and the announcement last month of the aid freeze and subsequent waiver appeared to have thrown things into limbo. ""We are still assessing, working with partners, to see the extent to which this is affecting our needs,"" Mr Balde told the BBC. Faced with impossible choices, some refugees are already resorting to seek refuge in third countries, including in the Gulf, Europe and beyond. Some are embarking on ""very dangerous journeys"", he says. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly8nzpwnn4o,US star John Legend defends playing Rwanda concert during war,2025-02-24T14:59:14.241Z,Natasha Booty in London & Anita Nkonge in Kigali,"American singer-songwriter John Legend has told the BBC he is unfazed by a public backlash against his decision to perform in Rwanda, despite the country's involvement in the war in neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. ""I don't believe that we should punish the people of Rwanda and punish the people of other countries when we disagree with their leaders,"" he said after last week's concert in Kigali. In recent weeks, M23 rebels, backed by Rwanda, have seized the two largest cities in the mineral-rich east of the DR Congo. There is evidence Rwanda has sent 4,000 troops across the border to support the rebels. Hundreds of thousands of civilians are now destitute having fled their homes, and shocking violence, including the rape of children, has skyrocketed. Critics argue that Legend could have made a powerful statement by pulling out of the concert, especially given his highly respected ""EGOT"" status as someone who has won Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony awards. Fellow Grammy-winner Tems did pull out of a concert she was due to give on Saturday in Rwanda, saying she would ""never, ever intend to be insensitive to real-world issues"". But Legend defended his decision to headline the Move Afrika event in Kigali, which was run by the Global Citizen NGO and attracted thousands of fans from across the continent. He said he was not being paid for the performance but felt it was his duty to help ""grow touring capabilities"" on the African continent, which is often overlooked by international stars on so-called world tours. ""I'm aware of what's happening [in DR Congo] and I'm aware of the calls there have been for me to not do this show, but I really believe that the mission of Move Afrika is still important,"" he told the BBC. Delighted fans at the sold-out show agreed, but the social media backlash was ferocious enough to force Legend to delete an Instagram post he had made promoting the event. Belgium-based activist Denise Zanesa had argued that ""performing under the banner"" of Rwanda ""would be akin to collaborating with oppression itself"", in a message posted to X (formerly Twitter). It was a sentiment echoed by others, including Simone Umba in the US, who wrote in a TikTok video caption: ""So are we ready to talk about Rwanda's use of Black American culture in their soft campaigning to normalise their terrorising of eastern Congo?"" Taking a political stance would have been nothing new for the star. Legend is outspoken in his criticism of US President Donald Trump. He also severed ties with former mentor Kanye West when he ran for president, suspecting it was part of a wider Trump campaign to ""siphon"" black people's votes away from the Democrats. The debate over Rwanda's relationship with popular global figures is also not new. Most recently, Rwanda has been accused of ""sportswashing"" - with critics saying it uses the feel-good factor of international football to cover up alleged human rights abuses at home. The East African nation is said to receive $1bn (£800m) a year in foreign aid and its tourism arm - Visit Rwanda - has lucrative sponsorship deals with Arsenal in England, Bayern Munich in Germany and Paris St-Germain in France. When asked his thoughts on the topic, Legend's aide told the BBC that he would not answer that question. It appears that, as far as Legend and his team are concerned, his music itself should do the talking. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

The antelopes are third-generation descendants of mountain bongos taken from Kenya in the 1960s. The return of the critically endangered animals, from the Rare Species Conservation Foundation in Florida, was hailed as a ""monumental step"" in Kenya's conservation efforts. From about 500 in the 1970s, less than 100 mountain bongos are estimated to remain in the wild in Kenya, according to the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS). This was due to habitat loss, poaching, illegal activities, disease and small fragmented populations, the KWS said. Tourism Minister Rebecca Miano described the arrival of the bongos at the country's main airport on Sunday night as ""emotional and so cool"", and a benefit for Kenya's tourism and conservation sectors. The animals were taken to wildlife sanctuaries in Meru county near Mount Kenya, where they will be nurtured before they are gradually introduced to their natural habitat. Ms Miano said the mountain bongo, ""a species originally only found in Kenya, has suffered untold grief over the decades... dwindling to alarming proportions"". She said the plan was to grow the population to 700 by 2050. The mountain bongo, which has a bright chestnut-red colour with narrow white stripes, is the largest African forest-dwelling antelope, according to the KWS. It is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) as a Critically Endangered species - with more individuals in captivity than in the wild. The first repatriation to Kenya was in 2004 when 18 mountain bongos were flown into the country. KWS director-general Erastus Kanga said Kenya was expecting another batch of the mountain bongos from zoos in Europe in the next three months. From captivity, the bongos have to go through a series of adaptation phases for them to build the immunity needed to survive in the wild. In 2022, the head of conservancy at Mount Kenya Wildlife Conservancy (MKWC) told a Kenyan TV station that some of the bongos repatriated in 2004 had successfully been integrated into the wild and had started breeding. The MKWC official, Robert Aruho, however, said that others had died from tick-borne diseases, adding that building immunity takes time. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8ve60r53yo,Sudan army ends two-year siege of key city,2025-02-24T14:01:00.336Z,Basillioh Rukanga,"The Sudanese army says it has broken a near two-year siege imposed by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) on the key southern state capital of el-Obeid. The breakthrough came hours after the RSF signed a political charter in the Kenyan capital, Nairobi, to establish a breakaway government in areas under its control. The RSF and the army have been in a vicious battle for power since April 2023, with tens of thousands of people killed and millions forced from their homes. The war has split the country, with the army controlling the north and the east while the RSF holds most of the Darfur region in the west and parts of the south. El-Obeid, the capital of North Kordofan state, is a strategic hub connecting the capital, Khartoum, to Darfur. This is the latest army advance in recent weeks following the recapture of several parts of Khartoum from the RSF. There was jubilation on the streets as Sudanese soldiers marched into the city. A military spokesman, Nabil Abdallah, confirmed the gains in a statement, saying army forces had destroyed RSF units. Finance Minister Jibril Ibrahim said the move was a ""massive step"" in lifting the RSF siege of el-Fasher, the capital of North Darfur province, and would also allow the delivery of humanitarian aid to Kordofan. Sudanese civil society activist Dallia Abdlemoniem told the BBC Newsday programme that the recapture of the city "" was ""huge"" and ""significant"". She said the RSF had ""held the civilians captive for nearly two years"" in the city. The situation there was ""horrific"", she said, adding that there had been no medical or food aid in an area considered ""to be very risky in terms of famine and malnutrition"". She said she hoped more aid would now be allowed in. ""Lifting the siege brings life back to the city,"" Ahmed Hussein, a 53-year-old trader in el-Obeid, told the AFP news agency. Ms Abdelmoniem said the army was ""making serious groundwork in terms of moving towards the west, which is where the RSF is mainly centred"". The latest fighting around el-Fasher has forced medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) to halt operations at Zamzam, a famine-stricken camp nearby, which houses about 500,000 displaced people. MSF said it was a ""heartbreaking decision"" but it had ""little choice"" because it was too dangerous for its staff to operate there. Both the army and the RSF have been accused of committing grave atrocities against civilians during the war, with their leaders being sanctioned by the US. In addition, RSF has been accused of carrying out a genocide in Darfur. Both deny the accusations. Kenya's hosting of the RSF last week as it sought to form a parallel government was criticised by some human rights groups. On Sunday, Sudan's Foreign Minister Ali Youssef said his country would ""not accept"" any country recognising ""a so-called parallel government"". Earlier, Sudan's military government had warned it would take retaliatory measures against Kenya and has since recalled its ambassador from Nairobi. In response, Kenya's foreign ministry said there was ""no ulterior motive"" in ""providing non-partisan platforms to conflict parties"". Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c70q5wjjl4yo,The Kenyans saying no to motherhood and yes to sterilisation,2025-02-24T01:31:47.325Z,Danai Nesta Kupemba,"For as long as Nelly Naisula Sironka can remember she has never wanted children - and with one irreversible decision the 28-year-old Kenyan has ensured she never will get pregnant. Last October, she took the definitive step of undergoing a sterilisation procedure known as tubal ligation - permanently closing the door on motherhood. ""I feel liberated,"" the organisational development expert tells the BBC, adding that it has ensured her future is now entirely her own. The operation prevents pregnancy by blocking a woman's fallopian tubes and is sometimes referred to as ""getting your tubes tied"". Between 2020 and 2023, roughly 16,000 women in the East African country underwent tubal ligation, according to Kenya's health ministry. It is unclear how many of these women didn't already have children. Yet Dr Nelly Bosire says the kinds of women coming forward seeking sterilisation in Kenya is changing. ""Traditionally, the most common candidates for tubal ligation were women who already had multiple children,"" the Nairobi-based gynaecologist told the BBC. ""But now, we are seeing more women with fewer children opting for the procedure."" Sterilisation is only recommended for women who are certain they do not want to have biological children in the future, as reversal is difficult. ""Doctors don't typically encourage tubal ligation because the success rate of a reversal is very poor,"" said Dr Bosire. Despite coming from a large family, Ms Sironka said she never felt pressured to start her own - though societal norms in Kenya do place an expectation on women to have children. She credits her father with her stance as he encouraged her to focus on education - and gave her a love of reading. Books by US feminist authors like Toni Morrison, Angela Davis and bell hooks were a revelation. ""I interacted with women's life stories that didn't feature children at all,"" said Ms Sironka, who is now the chief of operations at Feminists in Kenya, an organisation which works to end gender violence. ""It made me realise that a life like this was possible."" She had contemplated sterilisation for years, but decided to go ahead after saving up the money for the operation and finding herself in a stable job that allowed her to take time off. It cost her 30,000 Kenyan shillings (£190; $230) at a private hospital. Ms Sironka felt that women's rights were being eroded around the world - especially as women in the US lost the constitutional right to abortion in 2022, which also influenced her decision. It made her fear that a woman's right to control her own body might be eroded elsewhere - and that she should do the procedure while she still could. ""Within Africa and in America, there has been a rise in fascism and authoritarian regimes, a perfect example of such is Kenya,"" she argued. When she told her family, it did not come as a surprise to them, as she had always been very vocal about her desire for a child-free life. And as for dating and relationships? ""I'm still thinking about it,"" she said with a shrug. And Ms Sironka is not alone in choosing a child-free life, challenging traditional expectations of womanhood. Across social media, there are those speaking openly about their choice not to have children and undergo sterilisation. Among them is Muthoni Gitau, an interior designer and podcaster. She shared her tubal ligation journey in a 30-minute YouTube video last March, explaining her decision to have the procedure. ""I think the first time I ever articulated... [that] I did not want to have children, I was about 10,"" she told the BBC. Her mother was heavily pregnant at the time, and a random question about her future popped into the conversation. ""I saw a possible partner. I saw travelling. I just never saw children,"" she said. Like Ms Sironka, Ms Gitau's decision was driven by a strong conviction to live life on her own terms. After trying birth control pills, which she said made her nauseous, she sought a more permanent solution. When she first approached a doctor about tubal ligation at the age of 23, she was met with resistance. She was given what felt like a sermon about how children were a blessing from God. ""He asked me, 'What if I meet someone who wants kids?'"" she said. The doctor seemed to have more consideration for an ""imaginary person"" rather than the actual patient sitting in front of him, she said. Ms Gitau said the dismissal was ""heart breaking"". It was another decade before her wish was finally granted. Dr Bosire points out that a significant challenge in Kenya is getting medics to shift their mindset and truly appreciate a patient's right to make decisions about their health. ""This ties in with our culture, where people believe it isn't normal for women to want a tubal ligation,"" she said. Another Kenyan gynaecologist, Dr Kireki Omanwa, admitted the issue was a matter of debate amongst colleagues and in medical circles. ""It remains inconclusive,"" he told the BBC. But Ms Gitau was not deterred and last year approached another doctor - this time at a non-governmental organisation that provides family planning services. She was armed with a bullet-point list of reasons to support her decision and was relieved to find there there was no pushback: ""The doctor was very kind."" Currently single, she is living happily with her decision, which she feels gives her control over her own life. The 34-year-old is also happy with the reaction to her video - and relieved that there has been no major backlash. She says most people online have been cheering her on, which has seen her confidence grow. ""Women can contribute to the world in so many other ways,"" she said. ""It does not have to be through raising a whole human being. I am grateful to live in a generation where choice is a thing.""  Additional reporting by the BBC's Susan Gachuchi.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c04zlv32rdqo,Mali to investigate claims soldiers 'executed' women and children,2025-02-22T19:10:03.252Z,Paul Njie,"Mali's military government says it is investigating allegations that soldiers ""coldly executed"" at least 24 civilians in the north of the country on Monday. That claim was made by a separatist Tuareg rebel alliance, called Azawad Liberation Front (FLA), which is battling the Malian government in the same region. The FLA accuse Malian forces and Russian Wagner mercenaries of intercepting two passenger vehicles travelling to Algeria from the Malian city of Gao and killing the civilians on board, including women and children. In a statement, army chief Gen Oumar Diarra said the allegations ""relayed by terrorist networks, allies and sponsors"" follow other ""unfounded"" claims against state forces. For many years, the Malian government has been struggling against both Tuareg rebels seeking a breakaway state in the north and jihadist groups linked to al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group. The military which seized power in coups in 2020 and 2021 hired Russian mercenaries from the paramilitary group Wagner to help improve security in the country. Both government forces and the Russians have often been accused by rights groups of committing gross human rights abuses against civilians, which they deny. Last month, Mali was one of three countries under military rule to leave the West African regional bloc Ecowas, after refusing its demands to restore civilian rule. The withdrawal of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger dealt a huge blow to Ecowas, which at 50 years old is considered Africa's most important regional group. Mali's military leaders also ended ties with former colonial power France, whose troops left the country in 2022 after more than a decade fighting Islamist insurgents. The following year, all 12,000 UN peacekeepers left Mali on the junta's instructions. Additional reporting by the BBC's Natasha Booty. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

Jerry Muhindo Kavali, 49, was injured two days ago by a bullet that struck the Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) office in Masisi where he was working. He was taken to hospital in Goma for life-saving treatment but died of his wounds on Saturday. Colleagues say he was deeply dedicated to humanitarian work and ""always had a smile on his face"". Kavali's death has angered aid workers trying to help the tens of thousands of Congolese people whose lives have been destroyed by the war. ""Even war has its rules"", said MSF in response to the news. The town of Masisi, where the MSF worker was shot, has witnessed fierce fighting between militias allied with the Congolese army and rebels belonging to the M23 and Alliance Fleuve Congo rebel groups. The bullet that killed Kavali was ""one of many bullets to hit our premises over recent weeks"", the MSF head of programmes Stephan Goetghebuer said. Key areas already under M23 control include provincial capitals Goma and Bukavu, and the rebels appear to be continuing their advance. Eastern DR Congo is rich in minerals and this battle for control of the region partly has its roots in the 1994 Rwandan genocide. It has been riven by conflict for more than 30 years and attempts in recent years to integrate rebels into the Congolese army have failed. Experts now fear what effects the conflict will have on the wider East Africa region. On Friday, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution condemning the M23 offensive in eastern DR Congo, urging Rwanda to stop supporting the rebels, and saying they should immediately leave Congolese territory ""without preconditions"". This week, the US announced sanctions on M23 Spokesman Lawrence Kanyuka and Rwandan minister James Kabarebe for his alleged role in the conflict.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d5zqg3228o,How DR Congo's Tutsis become foreigners in their own country,2025-02-22T01:16:14.763Z,Wedaeli Chibelushi,"The notorious M23 rebel group is wreaking havoc in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, seizing the region's two biggest cities in a deadly uprising which has forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes. Central to their campaign is the assertion that ethnic Tutsis living in DR Congo are being persecuted. Digging into the status of Tutsis in DR Congo - and how it relates to the M23 uprising - is a complex and sensitive matter that goes to the heart of who is considered Congolese. For starters, many global authorities argue that in their purported fight against discrimination, the rebels have committed unjustifiable atrocities. The UN and US, for instance, have sanctioned M23 leaders over allegations of war crimes, such as sexual violence and the killing of civilians. Secondly, some regional analysts say that rather than seeking to defend Tutsis, the M23 - and Rwanda, which backs the rebel group - is primarily seeking to exploit the eastern DR Congo's vast mineral wealth. It is also worth noting that there are thought to be hundreds of thousands of Tutsis in DR Congo - there is no official estimate - and many do not support the actions being carried out in their name. That being said, experts and organisations like the UN have documented decades of discrimination against Congolese Tutsis and the Banyamulenge - a Tutsi sub-group concentrated in the South Kivu province. This ranges from ethnic killings, to workplace discrimination, to hate speech on the part of politicians. At the root of this discrimination is the association of Tutsis with neighbouring Rwanda, which has been led by Tutsis since 1994. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, many Congolese Tutsis played a key role in violent Rwandan-backed rebellions against the governments then running DR Congo. The perception that Congolese Tutsis are ""foreign"" can have deadly consequences. Bukuru Muhizi, a researcher and economist from South Kivu's Mwenga territory, told the BBC that people from various generations of his family had been killed because of their Banyamulenge and Tutsi identities. He said that in the past six years, his great-uncle and great-uncle's son were killed by Congolese soldiers and local militia fighters. The Congolese armed forces have not responded to the BBC's request for comment on this allegation. Mr Muhizi said his family has lived in present-day DR Congo for centuries and that he ""wished the world knew"" his community was experiencing what he called a ""silent genocide"". Muragwa Cheez Bienvenue, a Banyamulenge activist, said he was once targeted by airport staff in the city of Bukavu. ""I was stopped - they told me I look like [Rwandan President] Kagame and they had me pay around $150 (£120) to save myself from being imprisoned,"" he told the BBC, adding that he supports the M23's cause. Prior to colonisation, part of the territory that is now DR Congo was subject to the Rwandan monarchy, which is Tutsi. It had long been fighting expansionist wars, extending the kingdom to include more and more of East Africa. Tutsis, Hutus and other ethnic groups lived in the Rwandan kingdom and had done so since at least the 19th Century. But when colonial powers drew up arbitrary borders in Africa, the kingdom was split between present-day DR Congo and Rwanda. Subsequently, other Tutsis have migrated to DR Congo in waves. In the mid-20th Century, Belgian colonialists brought workers over from present-day Rwanda to staff their plantations, while others came on their own accord in search of a better life. Meanwhile, Tutsi refugees began arriving in DR Congo, fleeing waves of ethnic violence in Rwanda and Burundi. Both countries have long been dominated by their Tutsi minorities, leading to tensions with the Hutu majority. Many more are thought to have arrived in 1994 during the Rwandan genocide, in which some 800,000 people, mostly Tutsis, were slaughtered. But when a Tutsi-led government seized power and ended the massacres, some returned, especially after some of those responsible for the genocide then fled into DR Congo. As DR Congo's Tutsi and Banyamulenge communities grew, the Congolese authorities ""alternately empowered and the undermined"" them, Jason K Stearns, a DR Congo analyst, wrote in his book The War That Doesn't Say Its Name. In the early 1970s, then-President Mobutu Sese Seko granted citizenship to anyone who had originated from Rwanda or Burundi, provided they were present on Congolese territory before 1960. But in 1981, parliament rowed back on these rights and many Tutsis, Banyamulenge and people from other minority groups were ""derived of their nationality and left stateless"", a UN report noted. In the 1990s, Tutsis and the Banyamulenge were subject to multiple massacres in DR Congo. For instance, a report by the UN says that the Congolese army aided armed groups in killing nearly 300 Banyamulenge civilians in the city of Baraka in 1996. It also states that ""many"" Tutsis and Banyamulenge lost their jobs and suffered discrimination and threats. Today, the constitution considers the Tutsi and Banyamulenge groups to be Congolese and some individuals from these communities occupy senior military and governance positions. In fact, Lt-Gen Pacifique Masunzu, the man leading the fight against the M23 as the commander of a key area in eastern DR Congo, is from the Banyamulenge community. But there is still significant evidence of discrimination. In 2024, experts working for the UN said that in South Kivu, Banyamulenge are commonly seen as harmful to their neighbouring communities. This discourse incites ""hatred, discrimination, hostility and violence"", the experts said. There have also been recent reports of Tutsi and Banyamulenge soldiers in the Congolese army being murdered. According to Human Rights Watch, a mob killed a Banyamulenge military officer in 2023 ""in an apparent case of ethnic hatred"". Politicians - past and present - have also pushed discriminatory sentiment. Anti-Tutsi feelings appear to rise during M23 rebellions, say DR Congo experts such as Mr Stearns. He told the BBC he had seen ""pretty terrifying"" social media posts over the past few weeks - ""a phenomenon of people in other parts of the country expressing doubts over a certain person, often an army officer or police officers... the way he looks, and claiming that certain people look like they're Rwandan"". Although some Congolese Tutsis may back the M23's current uprising, Mr Stearns says ""many of them feel uncomfortable with the consequences this will have for them as a community, because once again, this means that they will be portrayed as treasonous rebels"". The Congolese government has gone some way in acknowledging the discrimination against Tutsis. For instance, earlier this year President Félix Tshisekedi said he had ""had enough"" of anti-Banyamulenge speech and alleged that such comments gave Rwanda the pretext to invade DR Congo. However, the authorities have also played down allegations of widespread persecution. Government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya told the BBC: ""We have 450 tribes and there is conflict between some of them in many parts of the country... The government position is against any kind of discrimination or hate speech against every community"". Mr Bienvenue on the other hand told the BBC he ""strongly"" believed his ethnic group was discriminated against, giving the example that his sister was once sacked after being told she ""looked like a Rwandan spy"". This is despite his family living in the same area for centuries. ""The Banyamulenge have been here since Congo was Congo!"" he said, exasperated.

The invite comes at the end of a week which saw Kyiv excluded from US-Russia talks on how to bring an end to the three-year war in Ukraine. In a phone conversation, Ramaphosa and Zelensky ""agreed on the urgent need for an inclusive peace process"", according to a statement from the South African president. A sentiment Zelensky echoed by saying ""nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine"". South Africa, which has in the past been accused of having a closer relationship with Moscow, has tried to play a role in finding an end to the fighting. In 2023, Ramaphosa led a delegation consisting of seven African countries, including Egypt, Senegal, Zambia, and Uganda, and met Zelensky and Russian President Vladimir Putin. South Africa has historic ties with Russia, and both countries form part of the influential Brics bloc - an alliance of major economies that also includes Brazil, India and China. Ramaphosa, in a post shared on his X page, said: ""I welcome the constructive engagement I had with President [Zelensky] and I look forward to hosting him in South Africa soon for a state visit."" Zelensky, on his part, said he had thanked Ramaphosa for ""South Africa's support of Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity"" in their conversation. ""We all hope to achieve a just and lasting peace this year,"" he added. Ramaphosa and Zelensky have had regular conversations since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022 - and have met in person - but despite Zelensky's interest in a state visit to South Africa, there has been no movement to make this happen until now. The Ukrainian leader back in December expressed his interest in coming to South Africa during an engagement with African journalists at the International Food Summit, according to South African online publication News24. ""I will be in Pretoria with pleasure, but you must ask Mr Ramaphosa because I think he is more busy,"" he told the publication. Dr Oscar van Heerden, a political analyst at the University of Johannesburg, hailed the planned state visit as a ""brilliant"" move by South Africa – because it not only allows Kyiv a platform to express its concerns amid the US-Russia talks but sends ""a number of messages globally"". ""Ramaphosa is being clever because [US President Donald] Trump might want to dismiss South Africa as a... small African country but we are yet again able to demonstrate that we can operate above our station internationally."" He added that Zelensky may be appealing to South Africa due to the country's relationship with Russia and its role as an ""honest broker"" with no vested interest in the war. Zelensky's continued engagement with world leaders comes amid its increasingly tense relationship with the US, which it considers a key ally. The tension took a turn for the worse this week when Trump accused Zelensky of being a a ""dictator"" who has ""done a terrible job"". South Africa's invite also comes at a time of increasingly strained relations with the US. The Trump administration recently cut off aid to the country over a new land expropriation law. Ramaphosa has said that his country ""will not be bullied"". Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

The poll was supposed to bring about an end to military rule after 10 years and the cancellation of the outcome threw the country into turmoil. The date of the vote – 12 June - is now remembered in Nigeria as Democracy Day. Gen Babangida was forced to resign. Moshood Abiola, widely believed to have won the election, was later imprisoned and his wife assassinated. Nigeria's current President, Bola Tinubu, said Gen Babangida had shown courage by admitting what took place. The former military leader, 83, expressed his regret at the launch of his autobiography A Journey in Service in the capital, Abuja, on Thursday. ""Undoubtedly credible, free and fair elections were held on 12 June 1993,"" he told the audience made up of the cream of Nigerian society, including Tinubu, two former presidents – Olusegun Obasanjo and Goodluck Jonathan - and two other ex-military leaders, Abdulsalam Abubakar and Yakubu Gowon. ""However, the tragic irony of history remains that the administration that devised a near-perfect electoral system and conducted those near-perfect elections could not complete the process. ""That accident of history is most regrettable. The nation is entitled to expect my expression of regret."" Gen Babangida, popularly known as IBB, also acknowledged that Abiola, who died in 1998, won the election. However, in 1993 as results were being collated, the military government abruptly stopped the process - an action that triggered widespread protests and a political crisis. For three decades, the circumstances surrounding the 1993 election have been shrouded in controversy, with conflicting accounts emerging overtime. This new admission, seen as reopening old wounds, has triggered fresh debates rather than closure. Many people will be expecting the former military ruler to also provide answers to some questions relating to his policies at the time. Gen Babangida, who overthrew another military leader Muhammadu Buhari in 1985, led the county for eight years. Multiparty democracy did eventually return to Nigeria in 1999 with the election of Obasanjo – who had also been a former military leader – as president.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4vdkmpg04o,Veteran Ugandan politician charged with treason,2025-02-21T11:46:40.406Z,Swaibu Ibrahim,"Veteran Ugandan opposition politician Kizza Besigye has been charged with treason in a civilian court after his controversial case was transferred from a military tribunal. Treason is a capital offence in Uganda and if found guilty the 68-year-old cold be sentenced to death. He was charged alongside two other suspects, but they did not enter a plea on the grounds that the charges against them could only be heard in a higher court. Besigye, who has run for president against long-serving leader Yoweri Museveni four times, has been in detention since he was dramatically abducted in Kenya in November and taken back to Uganda to face a military trial. But a landmark ruling by the Supreme Court last month said that trying civilians in military courts was unconstitutional and ordering all such cases to be transferred. The move angered President Museveni, who called it ""a wrong decision"". At the start of last week, Besigye had begun a hunger strike over his continued detention. The charges stem from accusations that he was plotting to remove Museveni from power by force. Friday was the first first time Besigye had appeared before a civilian court for formal charges, after the Supreme Court ruling. Visibly frail, he was wheeled before the Nakawa magistrate court in the capital, Kampala, alongside his aide and co-accused Obeid Lutale. The opposition politician has now called-off his hunger strike, his lawyer Erias Lukwago told journalists. According to the charge sheet presented before court, Besigye is accused of holding meetings in Switzerland, Greece and Kenya between 2023 and November last year in a plot to overturn the government. He was also accused of soliciting for military, financial and other logistical support to topple Museveni's government. Besigye was charged alongside Mr Lutale and Denis Oola, a military officer. Previous charges heard in the military court of illegal possession of ammunition and treachery were not included in the new charge sheet. During proceedings, Besigye's lawyer asked the court to order that he be transferred to a better health facility outside the prison but Magistrate Esther Nyadoi dismissed the application, saying she was unable to grant such a request. She ordered the accused to be remanded until next month to allow the prosecutor to finish the investigation. Besigye used to be a personal doctor for Museveni, who has been in power since 1986. The veteran opposition figure has previously accused the Ugandan authorities of political persecution. He has been less active in politics in recent years, and did not contest the 2021 election.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy0dg11y6xko,Rwanda angered by US sanctions over DR Congo violence,2025-02-21T10:00:59.540Z,Wycliffe Muia,"The Rwandan government has condemned the US decision to sanction a government minister for his alleged role in the conflict in the east of neighbouring Democratic Republic of Congo. Announcing the financial sanctions on Thursday, the US Treasury Department said Rwanda's Minister of State for Regional Integration James Kabarebe, a former army chief, was central to his country's support for the M23 rebel group. Also sanctioned was Lawrence Kanyuka, the M23's spokesman, as well as two companies he controls in Britain and France, the US Treasury said. On Friday, the UK said there would be ""consequences"" for Rwanda over its alleged role in DR Congo. Responding to the US move, Rwanda's foreign ministry said the sanctions would not resolve the conflict in the DR Congo, terming them ""unjustified and unfounded"". They come as the M23 appears to be continuing its advance after capturing two major cities in recent weeks in the mineral-rich east of DR Congo. The rebel group, mainly comprised of ethnic Tutsis, has seized the cities of Goma and Bukavu - sparking a major humanitarian crisis that left families devastated. Western powers have accused Rwanda of supporting the M23 with arms and as well as backing from the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF), accusations Rwanda denies. The US Treasury Department on Thursday said Kabarebe was sanctioned because ""he is central to Rwanda's support"" for the M23 armed group. It said Kabarebe together with Kanyuka were ""linked to violence and human rights abuses"" in DR Congo. ""Today's action underscores our intent to hold accountable key officials and leaders like Kabarebe and Kanyuka, who are enabling the RDF and M23's destabilising activities in the eastern DRC,"" said Bradley Smith, acting Under Secretary of the Treasury for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence. ""The United States remains committed to ensuring a peaceful resolution to this conflict."" But Rwanda dismissed the US action, saying Kigali's aim was only to secure its border and an ""irreversible end to the politics of armed ethnic extremism in our region"". ""Rwandans have the right to live in peace and without the perpetual threat of insecurity originating from the DRC,"" the ministry statement stated. ""Punitive measures, including sanctions, make no contribution toward long-term security, peace and stability for all the countries of the Great Lakes region,"" it added. DR Congo welcomed the US sanctions, saying it wanted to see more such measures. ""This marks the beginning of a long series of sanctions that we want to be more robust from the UN Security Council, the European Union and other partners in order to force Rwanda to withdraw its troops and cease its criminal activities on our soil,"" government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said in a statement posted on social media. Addressing G20 foreign ministers in South Africa on Friday, UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy termed the reported involvement of Rwandan troops a ""blatant breach of the UN Charter which risks spiralling into a regional conflict"". Speaking at the venue Brazilian Foreign Minister Mauro Vieira condemned the recent attacks on the UN forces and regional peacekeepers in DR Congo. For its part, China maintained that it ""firmly supports the African people in independently resolving African problems and opposes external interference in the internal affairs of African countries"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2erkxpevxvo,Trailblazing African film-maker and Cannes winner dies,2025-02-20T09:21:05.133Z,Basillioh Rukanga,"Malian film director Souleymane Cissé, one of the pioneers of African cinema, has died aged 84. His daughter, Mariam Cissé, confirmed his death at a clinic in the capital Bamako, expressing shock and mourning ""the loss of a man who dedicated his life to film and art"". The cause of his death has not been announced. Cissé gained international recognition in 1987 when his film Yeelen (The Light) won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, making him the first film-maker from sub-Saharan Africa to win an award at the prestigious festival. His trailblazing career spanned more than 50 years, winning many accolades along the way. In 2023, Cissé was honoured by Cannes with a Carrosse d'Or award, usually given to directors who have ""marked the history of cinema with their boldness, their exacting standards and their intransigence in staging"". Cissé was also a double winner of the grand prize at the biennial Pan-African Film Festival, Fespaco. At the time of his death he had been due to travel to Burkina Faso to preside over the jury at the festival, which opens on Saturday. Tributes have been pouring in for Cissé for his dedication to African storytelling. Mali's Culture Minister Mamou Daffé lamented the loss ""of this monument of African cinema"", while fellow Malian director Boubacar Sidibé said the country's film industry was in ""mourning"". Film lovers have praised Cissé's works for their complexity, political engagement and deep humanity. His first feature film, Den Muso (The Young Girl) shot in 1975, was in the local Bambara language, and is considered an African classic. The film is about a young girl who is raped, becomes pregnant and is rejected by her family. The film was banned by the Malian authorities, and Cissé was jailed for having accepted French funding. He wrote the screenplay for his second film, Baara (Work), while in prison. He made other films including Finyè (The Wind) in 1981, and Yeelen (The Light), which won the Jury Prize in Cannes in 1987. His last film in 1995 was Waati (Time). Cissé was born in Bamako, and spent part of his childhood in neighbouring Senegal. Later, he studied film in Russia's capital Moscow, becoming one of the first generation of African film-makers. Cissé went on to champion government support for and investment in the film industry. He was the founding president of the union representing West Africa's entrepreneurs in cinema and audiovisual arts. Cissé was often outspoken about other barriers to the spread of African cinema - criticising ""censorship"" and ""contempt"", and urging young film-makers not to act like ""beggars who must plead every time for financing from Europe"" but instead seek greater independence. Hours before his death, he reportedly urged Mali's military government to help the country's industry catch up with its continental rivals. ""It is not enough to make cinema, the works must also be visible,"" the AFP news agency quoted Cissé as saying. ""May the authorities help us with the construction of cinemas.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czepewl780eo,'Robbers stole the crosses from my daughter's and my mother's graves for scrap',2025-02-20T01:28:35.942Z,Alfred Lasteck,"Grave after grave after grave in this cemetery in the eastern Tanzanian city of Morogoro has been vandalised. In some, there is a gap where a metal crucifix once stood, in others the religious symbol is bent as thieves, who were hoping sell it to scrap merchants, tried and failed to remove it. More than 250 have been targeted in one small section of the Kola Municipal Cemetery alone. The crimes mostly happen at night when there is no security and there are no cemetery workers around. They have left families devastated and the sites desecrated, sparking anger. For more than two decades, Pudensiana Chumbi has been going to the cemetery about once a month to visit the graves of her daughter and mother - and to her distress both have been desecrated over the last few years, multiple times. The first to be targeted was the grave of her mother who died in 2000. A few months after the family had managed to save up to replace the stolen cross in late 2021, her daughter's grave was damaged. It was nearby and a little older - her daughter had died in 1997 aged 15. Before Ms Chumbi could make a decision about fixing her daughter's cross, to her horror the new cross on her mother's grave was stolen. In a quandary about what to do next, she felt metal was not an option when it came to replacing her daughter's cross. ""This is my child's grave - my fourth child,"" she said pointing towards the concrete cross. The theft of crosses and markers from graves has become a disturbing trend in this part of Tanzania, driven by the rising demand for scrap metal. ""The people doing this are cursed because everyone is sad about what is going on,"" Ms Chumbi tells the BBC. ""There are some young men who now demand payment to guard graves overnight, especially those with tiles."" Tiles can also be sold on for people to use as decorations in their home. Augustine Remmy, Ms Chumbi's brother, says it is upsetting for the whole community. ""This is too bad… when these areas that deserve respect are subjected to such bad acts, it truly hurts a lot,"" he tells the BBC. The rash of thefts reflects a desperation among some to make some money that overrides ethical concerns about damaging sacred sites. The criminals can earn between 700 and 870 Tanzanian shillings ($0.27-$0.34; £0.22-£0.28) per kilogramme. It is not a huge amount of money but it can be enough to pay for a plate of food from a vendor or some locally brewed alcohol. ""Metal dealers often buy without asking questions,"" says one man who admitted to the BBC that he had stolen crosses from a cemetery to sell on the scrap metal market. Agreeing to speak on condition of anonymity, he describes how the thieves would first go to welders who cut the crosses into pieces before taking them to the scrap merchants. The merchants are faced with the choice of buying cheaper stolen goods or abiding by the law. Izire Ramadhani, a dealer in Morogoro city centre, recalls how in 2023 he, along with some other scrap merchants, caught someone trying to sell a stolen cross and reported him to the authorities. ""In the past, they used to bring us crosses. But then we took one of them to the police, and later he was sentenced to three-and-a-half years in prison,"" Mr Ramadhani tells the BBC. He says this led to a reduction in the theft of crosses, although there has been a recent increase. Mr Ramadhani insists that he does not buy stolen goods. ""If a cross is brought here, the person coming to sell to us will be in trouble because we will take him to the police."" Thieves have also begun targeting other grave markers like tiles and marble decorations, which can easily be sold on to other buyers. Dr Ndimile Kilatu, Morogoro's health officer, said the city's authorities planned to improve cemetery security by introducing fences and guards but warned that ""this requires resources and time. ""It is not something that we can do today or tomorrow."" He also mentioned initiatives to educate scrap metal dealers about the materials that should not be bought, such as grave markers and railway components. Tanzania's government has also pledged to regulate the scrap metal industry. Deputy Prime Minister Dotto Biteko has emphasised the need for licensed businesses to adhere to the laws and regulations. ""What is required is just to enforce that and keep the population educated on the same subject. We will keep so educating our people so that we put our infrastructure safe,"" he told the BBC. Religious leaders are also appealing to their communities to do more to prevent those involved in these crimes from carrying them out. Pastor Steven Msigara from the Jesus Assembles of God in Morogoro has called for a united effort to educate young people on the need to respect sacred places. ""Together, we must restore their dignity, we know some youth are exposed to bad acts but we can return them to the right track,"" he says. For relatives of those whose graves have been desecrated, there is a feeling of frustration. Ms Chumbi wants more money to be spent on security at the cemeteries as well as a commitment to look after the sites with care befitting a place where loved ones are laid to rest. She is in the process of replacing her mother's cross for a second time - and, as in her daughter's case - is opting for concrete. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05mjdgd16po,Uganda discharges Ebola patients,2025-02-19T17:50:44.258Z,Makuochi Okafor,"Uganda has discharged eight patients who have recovered from the Sudan strain of Ebola after they tested negative twice, health officials have said. The disease has killed one person and infected eight others since an outbreak was reported last month, but 265 people, who were listed for monitoring, remain in quarantine. This is the eighth Ebola outbreak in Uganda since the first infection was recorded in 2000. The Sudan Ebola Virus Disease (SUDV) is a highly infectious haemorrhagic fever which is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids and tissues. It is one of several strains of the Ebola virus known to cause outbreaks. Unlike the more common Zaire Ebola virus, there is no approved vaccine for the Sudan strain. However, the government launched a trial vaccine earlier this month. Only a 32-year-old male nurse is known to have died in the latest outbreak. Uganda's Health Minister Jane Ruth Aceng Ocero confirmed the discharge of the eight patients, and said they should not be stigmatised. ""I urge their families and communities to receive and interact with them normally,"" the minister added. The UN World Health Organization (WHO) said their recovery was ""an important milestone"" in efforts to contain the outbreak. The Sudan strain is severe, normally killing at least 40% of those infected, but the fatality rate this time is low, the WHO said.  Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

Coalition partners derailed his budget after opposing his plan to raise value-added-tax (VAT), which would have seen the prices of goods go up at a time when South Africans are hard-hit by the cost-of-living crisis. Godongwana is a member of the African National Congress (ANC), which was forced to enter into a coalition after losing its parliamentary majority in elections last year. His failure to table the budget sent shockwaves in South Africa, as it has never happened since the end of white-minority rule in 1994. The currency plummeted against the US dollar, as markets reacted negatively to the news. The Democratic Alliance (DA), which is the second-biggest party in the coalition, was one of the most vocal critics of the proposed budget. Its leader John Stenhuisen said the party could not in ""good conscience"" agree to a VAT increase from 15% to 17% as it would have ""broken back the back of our economy"". VAT was last increased in 2018 from 14% to 15%. The ANC's other coalition partners, like the Freedom Front Plus, said they were only told of the proposed hike before Godongwana was due to table the budget. Godongwana told journalists that the planned increase was mentioned in the cabinet last week. The budget will now be tabled on 12 March, following further discussions to iron out differences, he said. The opposition Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) expressed dismay over the postponement, saying it was a ""symptom of weak, indecisive, and opportunistic governance"". But the DA hailed the postponement as a ""victory"", and said it would push for a budget that is ""better for growth and employment"".  Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly8397e7gno,Netherlands to return stolen Benin Bronzes to Nigeria,2025-02-19T13:39:24.994Z,Danai Nesta Kupemba,"The Netherlands says it will return more than 100 Benin Bronzes that British troops looted from Nigeria in the late 19th Century and which ended up in a Dutch museum. Thousands of these culturally significant sculptures and carvings were stolen during the violent destruction of Benin City, in modern-day Nigeria's Edo state, in 1897. The treasures were sold, some to private collectors and others to museums like the Wereldmuseum in The Netherlands, which has displayed the artefacts for decades. The return of the 119 artefacts was the ""largest repatriation of Benin antiquities"", said Olugbile Holloway, director-general of Nigeria's National Commission for Museums and Monuments (NCMM). Despite the name, not all the statues are made of bronze. They include figurines, tusks, sculptures of Benin's rulers, and an ivory mask. They were made during between the 15th and 19th Centuries. A transfer of agreement is due to be signed on Wednesday. Mr Holloway added that he hoped this would set a good example for other countries. In 2022, Germany was the first to return over 20 Benin bronzes in a bid to deal with its ""dark colonial history"". ""With this return, we are contributing to the redress of a historical injustice that is still felt today,"" said Dutch Minister of Culture, Education, and Science Eppo Bruins, reports the AFP news agency. The sculptures, prized for their beauty and technical artistry, are of spiritual and historical significance for the people from that part of Nigeria. Their theft still remains a point of pain for the descendants of those from the ancient Benin kingdom. This move may increase pressure on other institutions to return the Benin Bronzes, especially the British Museum, which has more than 900 artefacts. Protests and demonstrations have taken place outside the British Museum as part of a campaign for their return. However, an act of parliament prevents the British Museum from sending them back. For many in Nigeria, the Benin Bronzes are a potent reminder of the violence of colonialism. The NCMM has issued formal repatriation requests to museums across the world. Nigeria said it plans to open the Edo Museum of West African Art in Benin City in 2026, designed by the British-Ghanaian architect Sir David Adjaye, to house the largest collection of Benin Bronzes ever assembled.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly3nlv5d52o,"Even in his final seconds of life, first gay imam pushed boundaries",2025-02-19T00:16:15.080Z,Khanyisile Ngcobo,"The execution-style killing of an openly gay imam, Muhsin Hendricks, in South Africa has left people in the LGBTQ+ community fearful for their safety - but also determined to forge ahead with the campaign to end their marginalisation in religious circles. Reverend Toni Kruger-Ayebazibwe, an openly gay Christian cleric, told the BBC that Hendricks was a ""gentle spirit"" who brought light into any room he occupied. ""The gap Muhsin leaves is massive,"" she said, adding that she knew for a fact that there were ""a large number of queer Muslims around the world who are grief stricken"". The 57-year-old was shot dead in what appeared to be a hit on Saturday in the small coastal city of Gqeberha. Initial reports that Cape Town-based Hendricks had been in Gqeberha to perform the wedding ceremony of a gay couple have been dismissed as untrue by his Al-Gurbaah Foundation. ""He was visiting Gqeberha to officiate the marriages of two interfaith heterosexual couples when he was tragically shot and killed,"" it said in a statement. It is unclear why the couples had asked Hendricks to oversee their ceremonies, but it suggests that he was pushing the boundaries, even in the last seconds of his life. Traditional imams in South Africa rarely, if ever, perform the marriage of a Muslim to a non-Muslim - something that Hendricks clearly had no issue with. He had, according to a faith leader that the BBC spoke to, conducted one such marriage ceremony and was on his way to conduct the next one when he was gunned down in his vehicle. Two leading bodies that represent imams - the Muslim Judicial Council (MJC) and the United Ulama Council of South Africa (UUCSA) - condemned Hendricks' killing. ""As members of a democratic, pluralistic society, the MJC remains steadfast in advocating for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect, even amidst divergent views,"" the MJC said, while the UUCSA said it condemned ""all forms of extra-judicial killings"". However, Hendricks - who did his Islamic studies in Pakistan - was a pariah in their circles, as they hold the view that Islam prohibits same-sex relations. They pointedly referred to him as ""Mr Hendricks"", rather than by religious titles like imam or sheikh. In contrast, Hendricks' supporters hailed him as the world's first openly gay imam who made it possible for them to reconcile their sexuality with their Islamic faith. That he was a trail-blazer is not surprising - South Africa's constitution, adopted in 1996 after the end of white-minority rule, was the first in the world to protect people from discrimination because of their sexual orientation. Then in 2006, South Africa became the first country in Africa to legalise same-sex marriage. Once in a heterosexual marriage with children, Hendricks came out as gay in 1996 - and, according to The Conversation, he later broke another taboo by marrying a Hindu man. He then spearheaded the formation of The Inner Circle as ""an underground social and support group"" for queer Muslims. It started out at his home in Cape Town, and has ""proven to be very successful in helping Muslims who are queer to reconcile Islam with their sexuality"", The Inner Circle's website says. Despite South Africa having a thriving LGBTQ+ scene, members of the community still face some stigmatisation and violence. Only a few of the country's religious groups have adopted policies that are more favourable towards the community, among them the Dutch Reformed Church and the Methodist Church of Southern Africa. The Dutch Reformed Church was in 2019 forced by the courts to reinstate a policy it had introduced four years earlier, but then scrapped, allowing same-sex marriages and for gay and lesbian pastors to be in romantic relationships. The following year, the Methodist Church said that while it was ""not yet ready to apply for its ministers to officiate at same-sex marriages"", no congregant residing in a member country that recognised civil unions would be ""prevented from entering into such a union which can be as same-sex or opposite sex couples"". Reverend Ecclesia de Lange, the director at Inclusive and Affirming Ministries (IAM), told the BBC that even in instances where faith groups had adopted inclusive policies there were still ""pockets of very strong conservatism"". ""The traditional interpretations of sacred texts continue to exclude LGBTQ+ people, so the struggle for acceptance within faith communities remains ongoing,"" she said. Senior lecturer in Islamic Studies at South Africa's University of the Western Cape, Dr Fatima Essop, reflected on the ""distressing"" vitriolic content circulating on social media in the wake of Hendricks' killing. ""I just find that completely shocking and so far removed from our... Islamic tradition, which is all about compassion and mercy and preservation of human life,"" she told the BBC. Dr Essop added that while she understood some of the strong feelings against Hendricks' work, there was ""absolutely no justification, Islamic or otherwise, for this kind of violence"". And while the motive is unclear, Hendricks' killing - and the negative comments that followed - was likely to make people fearful to ""speak about their sexuality or sexual orientation"", Dr Essop said. Reverend Kruger-Ayebazibwe said that while Hendricks' shooting would make LGBTQ+ leaders rethink their security, it would not deter them from campaigning for change ""because the work matters too much"". Hendricks has already been buried at a private ceremony, though his Al-Gurbaah Foundation has pledged to organise a memorial in the near future to ""honour his immense contributions"". For Teboho Klaas, the religion programme officer at The Other Foundation, which champions LGBTQ+ rights in southern Africa, his killers may have cut his life short ""but not his legacy because he has multiplied himself"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y98jjwx4no,Rebels leave families devastated in wake of DR Congo advance,2025-02-18T17:52:14.175Z,Orla Guerin,"Heshima winces in pain as he tries to shift his weight, sweat beading on his face. The slight 13-year-old sits on a bed in a tent in the grounds of an overcrowded hospital in Goma city in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo. Heshima's left leg is a bandaged stump, his stomach is streaked with burn marks, and both of his parents have been killed. A relative, Tantine, tells us who is to blame: M23 rebels - backed by Rwanda and battling the Congolese army, known as the FARDC. The rebels now control the two largest cities in this mineral-rich area, which borders Rwanda. ""It was a Sunday,"" she says. ""There was fighting between them and the FARDC. They dropped the bomb, and I lost six members of my family."" The M23 portray themselves as freedom fighters, bringing peace and order to a failed state, and a failed leader in Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi. The rebel group, mainly comprised of ethnic Tutsis, has been on the march since early 2022, seizing swathes of territory - with the help of up to 4,000 Rwandan troops. That is according to UN experts who say Rwanda has ""de facto control"" over the group - claims Kigali and Rwandan President Paul Kagame deny. The price of the M23's gains can be counted at Ndosho Hospital, where Heshima is being treated. Doctors are struggling to clear a backlog of civilians and soldiers wounded at the end of January, when the rebels took Goma. The M23 say they ""liberated"" the city. The death toll in the fighting was close to 3,000 people, according to a UN estimate. Four operating rooms are in use - simultaneously - throughout the day and sometimes at night. ""It's been a terrible situation for the doctors,"" says Myriam Favier of the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which supports the hospital. The medics have been sleeping in the operating theatres, she says. ""Our medical supplies were looted at the very beginning of the escalation of the conflict. And we had an influx that was unseen before - between 100 and 150 patients a day for weeks."" That is now down to about 10 admissions per day, according to Ms Favier, and ""right now people are just trying to live again"". Drive around Goma and the streets hum with motorbikes. Many shops are open, and pavement sellers are back with their piles of onions and avocados and tomatoes. There is little sign of well-armed M23 fighters. They do not stand on street corners. They don't need to. Everyone knows they are in charge. People would accept the devil here, one local man said, if they thought he would bring peace. Others are more wary. A journalist said many in the media are ""self- censoring"" what they report, waiting to gauge how the new rulers will behave. One activist told me many were ""living in a big silence"" because of fear of reprisals by the rebels. ""This is the most worrying period of Goma's history,"" he said. ""I am afraid, the future is very uncertain."" Not according to the M23. ""Expect peace, security, development, job creation… a future with zero refugees, zero corruption, zero hunger,"" Willy Manzi, a newly appointed M23 vice governor who has recently returned from Canada, posted on the social media platform X. But a different message was delivered to tens of thousands of people who have sought refuge from fighting in recent years in a network of camps in Goma. They were given 72 hours to go. The M23 want the camps erased, along with any rival armed groups hiding in them. ""They came and told us, 'You have three days to leave,'"" says Divine, 19, who has one child on her hip, and another at her feet. ""We were very scared because we have nowhere to go. Our houses have been destroyed. Hunger is killing us here, but how we can go home to nothing?"" As she speaks a crowd gathers around us. There are silent nods and worried faces. ""They were our enemies and now they are our neighbours,"" says one man, who asks not to be named. Home for Divine is Bulengo camp - an expanse of scrappy white tents, perched on dark volcanic rock, surrounded by green hills. Many of the shelters are little more than scraps of tarpaulin. But the camp was something to cling to - until the M23 ultimatum. When we visited many were already packing up, salvaging bits of wood and plastic, and rolling up bedding. After ordering people out the camps the M23 later said they were ""encouraging voluntary returns"". It does not feel voluntary to many of the displaced. Human rights groups say it fits a pattern of abuses by the rebels who they accuse of indiscriminate shelling, gang rape and summary executions. They level the same accusations at the Congolese army and their allies. The decades long conflict has its roots - in part - in the Rwanda genocide of 1994, when around 800,000 people, mostly Tutis, were killed by Hutu extremists. Afterwards many Hutus fled into DR Congo, including some involved the genocide. Rwanda says they remain a threat. Critics say Kigali has its eye on DR Congo's vast mineral wealth, crucial for much of the world's technology including laptops and mobile phones. There are growing fears that the scramble for control of these riches could trigger a new regional war, with implications far beyond Africa. Either way - if history is any guide - the treasures beneath the soil are unlikely to benefit the people here. Back at Bulengo camp we met Alphonsine, who was leaving with her extended family, bent double with the weight of belongings tied to her back. She said it would be a two day walk to reach her area, and there was nothing to go back to. Her home had been destroyed. ""How will you survive?"" I asked. ""I came from suffering,"" she said, ""and I leave in suffering."" Additional reporting from the BBC's Wietske Burema and Göktay Koraltan.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rzw8wqn8vo,"Villagers killed execution-style in Sudan, activists say",2025-02-18T13:33:35.362Z,Natasha Booty,"More than 200 unarmed civilians have been killed in a cluster of villages in Sudan over three days by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) that is involved in a brutal conflict with the military, a local rights group has said. The Emergency Lawyers network said the attacks happened in al-Kadaris and al-Khelwat towards the north of White Nile state - areas where the military had no presence. RSF fighters were guilty of ""executions, kidnappings, enforced disappearances and property looting"", the network added. The RSF, which was allied to the military before the civil war broke out in April 2023, has not commented on the allegations. The two had come to power together in a coup - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule. Some senior RSF leaders are currently in Kenya where they are expected to announce plans to form their own government in areas under their control. Analysts warn the move could deepen divisions in Sudan. Humanitarians have been sounding the alarm over Sudan, where the conflict has forced about 12 million people from their homes. Tens of thousands of civilians have been killed, with both the RSF and army accused of committing atrocities. At the heart of this conflict is a falling out between Sudan's de facto ruler and army chief Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and his deputy-turned-rival Mohamed Hamdan ""Hemedti"" Dagalo, who leads the RSF. The RSF was recently dealt a significant blow when the army regained control of parts of the capital, Khartoum - including its military headquarters. Beyond the capital, the army has also won near total control of the crucial state of Gezira. Following the setbacks, the RSF has rebounded with plans to launch a rival government in areas still under its control, which are mainly in Darfur and parts of Kordofan state. The RSF is meeting allied groups in Nairobi to finalise the adoption of what it calls a ""political charter for the Government of Peace and Unity"". Gen Burhan has rejected the move, and has vowed to reclaim the whole of Khartoum. He is currently based in Port Sudan, having been forced to leave Khartoum months after the civil war broke out when the RSF seized the military headquarters and the presidential palace.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgeg6rz8xvo,Detained Ugandan opposition figure treated in clinic overnight,2025-02-17T17:05:30.864Z,Basillioh Rukanga,"Detained Ugandan opposition politician Kizza Besigye, on hunger strike for a week, has been returned to prison after being in a clinic overnight, his allies have said. The 68-year-old was rushed to a private medical facility in a prison ambulance as his his health was deteriorating, his lawyer Erias Lukwago wrote earlier on Facebook. Besigye was charged in a military court with illegal possession of a firearm, threatening national security, as well as treason, which carries the death sentence. He denies the accusations. The news about his health came hours after a cabinet minister said he had seen Besigye in jail. He urged him to resume eating and pledged to drop his military trial. Another leading opposition politician, Bobi Wine, along with human rights activists, went to the prison on Monday to visit Besigye. But Bobi Wine said that prison officers refused to let them see him as he was very weak. ""This man is actually dying. Dr Besigye is in a terrible state. He cannot leave his bed,"" Bobi Wine told reporters as he called for his release. He added that Besigye's co-accused, Obed Lutale, ""told us that Besigye collapsed this morning when they were trying to carry him out of his bed"". When contacted by the BBC, Uganda Prisons spokesperson Frank Baine refused to comment. ""I said no comment, that is enough,"" he added. Besigye, who has run for president against long-serving leader Yoweri Museveni four times, has been in detention since he was dramatically abducted in Kenya in November and taken back to Uganda to face a military trial. Last month, the Supreme Court ruled that trying civilians in military courts was unconstitutional. The government had insisted Besigye's military trial would continue and President Museveni dismissed the ruling as ""a wrong decision"", vowing to challenge it. But on Sunday, Information Minister Chris Baryomunsi said he had seen Besigye in prison ""in the presence of his doctors"" and had asked him to end the hunger strike ""as the government fast-tracks the transfer of his case from a court martial to a civil court"". Besigye's wife, Winnie Byanyima, however said the visit was ""highly suspicious"". ""As a government minister, you are not a concerned visitor - you are his captor,"" Ms Byanyima, who is the director of the UN's HIV/Aids programme, posted on X. ""We will hold you and your government fully accountable for any harm that comes to him,"" she added. On Sunday night, a lawmaker allied to the detained politician said Besigye had been taken to a clinic in a suburb of Kampala ""amidst very heavy security deployment"". Francis Mwijukye added Besigye was ""being pushed in a wheel chair"". Wafula Oguttu, a former leader of the opposition in parliament and a Besigye ally, said prison officers around the clinic told him they would take him back to jail after a series of tests had been conducted. Oguttu told the BBC that he had not been allowed to enter the clinic. One of Besigye's political aides, Harold Kaija, said he was now back in prison. Besigye went on hunger strike a week ago to protest against his continued detention by the military, with his trial yet to start. He is a former ally of Museveni - who has been in power since 1986 - and was once his personal doctor. Besigye has previously accused the authorities of political persecution. In recent years he has been less active in politics and did not contest the 2021 election. Besigye appeared before a court on Friday - in a separate case - looking frail. The Ugandan medical doctors' association has since called for his ""immediate release"" on health grounds. There have increasing calls by the family, opposition and human rights groups for Besigye to be released on medical grounds.  Additional reporting by the BBC's Swaibu Ibrahim in Kampala.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c23n317vl7ko,Mauritius ex-PM bailed after 'suitcases of cash' arrest,2025-02-17T15:43:20.439Z,Yasine Mohabuth,"Mauritius' former Prime Minister Pravind Jugnauth has been released on bail following his dramatic arrest on Saturday on money laundering charges. He had been detained along with three others after the anti-corruption agency said it had seized suitcases of cash and luxury watches in raids on 10 locations, including Jugnauth's home. The former prime minister's lawyer said he denied the charges against him. Jugnauth's arrest came 100 days after his landslide defeat in elections, with his successor Navin Ramgoolam vowing to root out corruption. But few Mauritians expected the Financial Crimes Commission (FCC) to move so quickly, or to arrest the former prime minister on such serious charges. Some people took to the streets of the capital, Port Louis, to celebrate by lighting firecrackers, while a handful of his supporters turned up outside court on Monday to show their solidarity with him, chanting: ""Pravin! Pravin!"" His wife Kobita - who is not facing the charges - was released after being questioned for hours by investigators on Saturday. Her 63-year-old husband spent the night in a detention centre, before a magistrate granted him bail late on Sunday, setting it at $32,000 (£26,000). Jugnauth's co-accused - two prominent businesspeople and a deputy mayor - are still in detention, pending the outcome of their bail applications. Their lawyers have not yet commented on the charges against them. About $2.4m in local and foreign currencies - including US dollars, euros and UAE dirhams - were seized during the raids, FCC spokesperson Ibrahim Rossaye said. Seven luxury watches, including five high-end Cartier timepieces, were also confiscated, he added. As part of his bail conditions, Jugnauth has been ordered not to contact witnesses or to interfere with them. He must also stay at a fixed address and must inform the police if he decides to relocate. Jugnauth was the prime minister from 2017 to 2024 and is a member of one of the dynasties that has dominated politics in Mauritius. Jugnauth oversaw a historic deal with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer regarding the future of the Chagos Islands. The agreement aims to settle the long-standing sovereignty dispute over the islands, but his successor has accused him of negotiating a bad deal and has reopened talks.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglyl6el10xo,South Africa police 'hot on heels' of suspects in gay imam killing,2025-02-17T13:24:42.249Z,Damian Zane,"Police in South Africa are ""hot on the heels"" of the suspects behind the killing of Muhsin Hendricks, dubbed the world's first openly gay imam, Deputy Justice Minister Andries Nel has said. The 57-year-old was in a car when he was shot dead in broad daylight in the coastal city of Gqeberha on Saturday. CCTV footage of the incident shows a hooded figure running out of a pick-up truck that was blocking Hendricks' vehicle and then firing shots through the window. The imam was well known for his work in creating a safe haven for gay and other marginalised Muslims and his killing shocked the LGBTQ+ community and beyond. An investigation is under way but Nel told the Newzroom Afrika TV channel that it was too early to say whether it was a hate crime. Without giving further details, Nel said he was told by Deputy Police Minister Polly Boshielo that officers were tracking down the suspected killers. Paying tribute to Hendricks, Nel said that he ""was a South African that we can all be proud of, a South African that we can all aspire to be"". Hendricks' work challenged traditional interpretations of Islam, which oppose same-sex relations. While being clear that it did not agree with Hendricks, South Africa's Muslim Judicial Council (MJC), one of the country's main religious bodies, condemned the killing. ""As members of a democratic, pluralistic society, the MJC remains steadfast in advocating for peaceful coexistence and mutual respect, even amidst divergent views,"" it said. Another leading Muslim body - the United Ulama Council of South Africa -condemned ""extrajudicial killings"" and urged people not to jump to conclusions about the motive. South Africa's constitution, adopted after the end of white-minority rule in 1994, was the first in the world to protect people from discrimination because of their sexual orientation and in 2006, became the first country in Africa to legalise same-sex marriage. But despite a thriving LGBTQ+ community, gay people still face discrimination and violence. The country also has one of the highest murder rates in the world. Hendricks came out as gay in 1996, which shocked the wider Muslim community in his home city of Cape Town and elsewhere. That same year, he founded The Inner Circle, an organisation providing support and a safe space for queer Muslims seeking to reconcile their faith and sexuality before going on to establish the inclusive Masjidul Ghurbaah mosque. He was the subject of a documentary in 2022 called The Radical, in which he said about the threats he faced: ""The need to be authentic was greater than the fear to die."" Hendricks often spoke about the importance of interfaith dialogue and the need to address the mental health issues and trauma faced by LGBTQ+ individuals within religious communities. He told the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association World Conference in Cape Town last year: ""It is important that we stop to look at religion as the enemy.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgly1yrd9j3o,What's the fighting in DR Congo all about?,2025-02-16T20:17:39.007Z,Damian Zane,"The mineral-rich east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has been dogged by conflict for more than 30 years, since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. Numerous armed groups have competed with the central authorities for power and control of the potential fortune in this vast nation. The instability has sucked in neighbouring countries to devastating effect – notoriously in the 1990s when two huge conflicts, dubbed Africa's World Wars, resulted in the deaths of millions of people. After a rapid advance in the east, fighters from the M23 rebel group have captured a number of key cities and towns. Their first major coup was at the end of January with the taking of Goma – a city in the North Kivu province that is home to more than a million people. Sitting on the border with Rwanda and the shores of Lake Kivu, Goma is a vital trading and transport hub that is within reach of mining towns supplying metals and minerals in high demand. When the rebels took over Goma, UN aid agencies warned of a major humanitarian crisis with shortages of food and water, hospitals overwhelmed by casualties and bodies lying on the streets. The M23 have also seized another key city in the region, South Kivu provincial capital Bukavu. Other locations now under M23 control include Masisi, Rutshuru and Katale. The rebels previously threatened to continue their offensive to the capital, Kinshasa, although analysts say this may be unlikely, as the city is 2,600km (1,600 miles) away, on the other side of this vast country. The M23 are led by ethnic Tutsis, who say they needed to take up arms to protect the rights of the minority group. They say that several previous deals to end the fighting have not been respected - they take their name from a peace agreement that was signed on 23 March 2009. Shortly after its creation in 2012, the M23 rapidly gained territory and seized Goma – acts that were met with international opprobrium and accusations of war crimes and human rights violations. It was forced to withdraw from Goma, and then suffered a series of heavy defeats at the hands of the Congolese army along with a UN force that saw it expelled from the country. M23 fighters then agreed to be integrated into the army in return for promises that Tutsis would be protected. But, in 2021, the group took up arms again, saying the promises had been broken. M23 leader Sultani Makenga is a Congolese Tutsi who previously fought in the Rwandan army. Rwanda has in the past consistently denied that it supported the M23, but ever since 2012 UN experts have accused it of providing weapons, logistical support and even ultimately commanding the rebels. DR Congo's government, as well as the US and France, have also identified Rwanda as backing the group. Last year, a UN experts report said that up to 4,000 Rwandan troops were fighting alongside the M23. On Friday, Rwandan government spokesperson Yolande Makolo told the BBC that the country's troops were deployed along its border to prevent the conflict spilling over to its territory. Rwanda previously said it was being scapegoated and blamed the recent fighting on the Congolese authorities, saying they had refused to enter into a dialogue with the M23. A peace process, mediated by Angola and involving Rwanda and DR Congo, did result in a ceasefire deal last year, however that soon fell apart and fighting resumed. The origin of the current fighting can partly be traced back to the genocide in Rwanda in 1994. About 800,000 people – the vast majority from the Tutsi community - were slaughtered by ethnic Hutu extremists. The genocide ended with the advance of a force of Tutsi-led rebels commanded by Paul Kagame, who is now president. Fearing reprisals, an estimated one million Hutus then fled across the border to what is now DR Congo. This stoked ethnic tensions as a marginalised Tutsi group in the east – the Banyamulenge – felt increasingly under threat. Rwanda's army twice invaded DR Congo, saying it was going after some of those responsible for the genocide, and worked with members of the Banyamulenge and other armed groups. After 30 years of conflict, one of the Hutu groups, the Democratic Forces for the Liberation of Rwanda (FDLR), which includes some of those responsible for the Rwandan genocide, is still active in eastern DR Congo. Rwanda describes the FDLR as a ""genocidal militia"" and says its continued existence in the DR Congo's east threatens its own territory. The Rwandan spokesperson said they wanted to return to Rwanda to ""finish the job"". It accuses the Congolese authorities of working with the FDLR - accusations which DR Congo denies. Rwanda is unlikely to stay out of DR Congo unless it is satisfied that the FDLR is no longer a threat to itself, or to the Tutsi communities in eastern DR Congo. DR Congo and multiple UN reports have accused Rwanda of using the conflict as a way of looting Congolese minerals, such as gold and coltan, which is used to make mobile phones and other electronic items such as cameras and inside cars. In recent years, the M23 has seized several lucrative mining areas and a report by UN experts last December said that around 120 tonnes of coltan was being sent by the M23 to Rwanda every four weeks. They also noted a huge rise in Rwanda's mineral exports in recent years, most of which is believed to come from DR Congo. Rwanda has consistently denied allegations of exploiting DR Congo's minerals. A UN peacekeeping mission has been in place since 1999. The current force – known as Monusco – is made up of more than 10,000 troops. However, of these, only the Force Intervention Brigade is allowed to carry out offensive operations against armed groups. It was this force that helped defeat the M23 in 2013. Monusco has been the target of anger from ordinary Congolese who see it as failing to do its job. President Félix Tshisekedi, deeming the mission a failure, had asked it to leave by the end of last year. But the departure was delayed and in December the mission was extended for another year. The Southern African Development Community (Sadc), a regional grouping of 16 countries, has also deployed a military force to eastern DR Congo, but it has been unable to halt the rebels. South Africa has said 14 of its soldiers have died in clashes with the M23. Soldiers from the likes of Malawi and Tanzania have also been killed. Cyril Ramaphosa, South Africa's president, warned Rwanda that further attacks on its troops would be considered a ""declaration of war"". Rwanda's President Paul Kagame hit back, accusing South Africa of being part of a ""belligerent force"" involved in ""offensive combat operations"". The UN said that Uruguay had lost one of its soldiers who was part of the Monusco force. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rqr8q5v52o,Second DR Congo city falls to Rwanda-backed rebels,2025-02-16T17:36:50.112Z,Emery Makumeno,"Rwandan-backed M23 rebels have entered Bukavu, the second-largest city in the eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, seizing the regional governor's office. Some people lined the streets to clap and cheer the fighters as they marched and drove into the city centre without resistance. It is the second city after Goma to fall to the rebels in the mineral-rich region in the past few weeks. The Congolese government has acknowledged its fall and urged residents to stay at home ""to avoid being targeted by the occupying forces"". The UN and European countries have warned that the latest offensive, which has seen hundreds of thousands of people forced from their homes, could spark a wider regional war. A resident in Bukavu, who asked to remain anonymous because of concerns for her safety, told the BBC on Sunday that most people were still afraid to leave their homes. ""Since yesterday the children and the youth took the weapons. They are shooting everywhere in all directions, they are looting,"" she said. ""This morning the M23 entered and they were acclaimed by the people, very happy to see them. We don't know if it's because they are afraid or because they found that there were no authorities in the city. ""The place where I live the crackling [gunfire] can still be heard."" On Friday, the M23 captured Bukavu's main airport, which is about 30km (18 miles) north of the city - and then began advancing slowly towards the city, which is the capital of South-Kivu province. The provincial governor, Jean-Jacques Purusi Sadiki, confirmed to the Reuters news agency the fighters were in Bukavu city centre by Sunday morning, adding that Congolese troops had withdrawn to avoid urban fighting. This left a security vacuum in the city on Saturday with chaotic scenes playing out, including a reported prison break from the central prison. The UN World Food Programme (WFP) said a warehouse with nearly 7,000 tonnes of food was looted. The city of around two million people on the southern tip of Lake Kivu borders Rwanda and is an important transit point for the local mineral trade. Its fall represents an unprecedented expansion of territory for the M23 since their latest insurgency started in late 2021 - and is a blow to the government of President Félix Tshisekedi. Government spokesman Patrick Muyaya said Rwanda was violating DR Congo's territorial integrity through expansionist ambitions and human rights abuses. The Congolese government accuses Rwanda of sowing chaos in the region - as well as having troops on the ground - so it can benefit from its natural resources, something Kigali denies. President Tshisekedi wants his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame to face sanctions over the latest unrest. But President Kagame has dismissed such threats - and has repeatedly pointed out that Rwanda's main priority is its security. He has long been angered by what he sees as the failure of the Congolese authorities to deal with the DR Congo-based FLDR rebel group, which he sees as a danger to Rwanda. The group is made up of some members of the ethnic Hutu militia accused of involvement in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda when over 100 days around 800,000 people, mainly from the Tutsi ethnic group, were killed. Troops from the Tusti-led M23 gathered at the Place de l'Indépendance in central Bukavu on Sunday, where one of its commanders, Bernard Byamungu, was filmed chatting to locals and answering their questions in Swahili. He urged government forces ""hiding in houses"" to surrender - and accused the withdrawing military of spreading terror by arming local youths who had gone on a looting rampage. The African Union (AU) - which has been holding a heads of state summit in Ethiopia this weekend - again urged the M23 to disarm. ""We are all very, very concerned about an open regional war,"" Reuters quotes the AU's peace and security commissioner Bankole Adeo as saying.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c87d9z4g5ywo,Dozens killed in Mali illegal gold mine collapse,2025-02-16T15:50:35.596Z,Ian Aikman & Thomas Naadi,"More than 40 people, mostly women, were killed after an illegal gold mine collapsed in Mali on Saturday. The collapse took place near Kéniéba, in Mali's western, gold-rich Kayes region. The victims had climbed into open-pit areas left by industrial miners to look for scraps of gold when the earth around them caved in, a gold miner's union leader told Reuters. This is Mali's second deadly mining accident in three weeks, after at least 10 people were killed when a mining tunnel flooded late in January. There are conflicting reports on the number people who died in Saturday's accident. A local police source told the AFP news agency that 48 people were killed in the collapse, while the head of an industry union told Reuters there were 43 victims. ""Some of the victims fell into the water. Among them was a woman with her baby on her back,"" the local police source told AFP. Rescue workers have been able to retrieve the bodies, local sources told the BBC. Mali is one of the biggest gold producers in the world. Accidents are common in the country as much mining activity is unregulated, with miners using unsafe methods to dig for gold. Just over a year ago, at least 40 people were killed after a tunnel collapsed in a mine. It is also common for illegal miners - mostly women - to try to recover gold from abandoned sites due to poverty. A spokesperson from the country's mines ministry confirmed to Reuters that the accident had taken place between the towns of Kéniéba and Dabia, but declined to give further details. Ministry teams are drawing up a report at the scene, Reuters reports. The collapse on Saturday occurred at an abandoned site formerly operated by a Chinese company, according to AFP. Beijing is heavily invested in developing Mali's mining industries, with the approval of its government. Since Mali is rich in natural resources, including gold, iron ore, manganese, lithium, and uranium, it is an attractive destination for Chinese investors. While such investment has improved Mali's infrastructure, especially in the transportation sector, the government has accumulated significant debt obligations to China, raising concerns about its ability to repay the loans. Chinese mining activities have also been criticised for contributing to environmental pollution in the country. Mali is currently engaged in a dispute over revenue sharing with one of the largest mining companies in the country, the Canadian firm Barrick. Last month, the Malian government seized gold bars worth $245m (£194m) from Barrick and issued an arrest warrant for its CEO, Mark Bristow. Mr Bristow said he had ""no doubt"" the conflict would be resolved in an interview with Bloomberg this week. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

The 57-year-old cleric ran a mosque in Cape Town intended as a safe haven for gay and other marginalised Muslims. He was killed on Saturday morning after the car in which he was travelling near the southern city of Gqeberha was ambushed. ""Two unknown suspects with covered faces got out of the vehicle and started firing multiple shots at the vehicle,"" police said in a statement. News of Hendricks' death has sent shockwaves through the LGBTQ+ community and beyond, prompting an outpouring of tributes from across the globe. Julia Ehrt, executive director at the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association (Ilga), called on the authorities to thoroughly investigate ""what we fear may be a hate crime"". ""He supported and mentored so many people in South Africa and around the world in their journey to reconcile with their faith, and his life has been a testament to the healing that solidarity across communities can bring in everyone's lives,"" she said.   Hendricks was killed after he had reportedly officiated at a lesbian wedding, though this has not been officially confirmed. The details of the attack emerged through security footage that was shared on social media. It shows a car pulling up and blocking the vehicle in which Hendricks was travelling as it was pulling away from the curb. According to police, the imam was in the back seat. The angle of CCTV footage reveals what happened from one side of the road - an assailant jumps out of a car, runs to the ambushed vehicle and shoots repeatedly through the back passenger window. Hendricks' Al-Ghurbaah Foundation, which runs the Masjidul Ghurbaah mosque in the Wynberg suburb of Cape Town, confirmed he had died in a targeted attack on Saturday morning. But Abdulmugheeth Petersen, chair of the foundation's board, appealed via a WhatsApp group for their followers to be patient, stressing the importance of protecting Hendricks' family. Hendricks' work challenged traditional interpretations of Islam and championed a compassionate, inclusive faith. South Africa's post-apartheid constitution was the first in the world to protect people from discrimination because of their sexual orientation and in 2006, became the first country in Africa to legalise same-sex marriage.

He told the Ilga World Conference in Cape Town last year: ""It is important that we stop to look at religion as the enemy."" Reverend Jide Macaulay, an openly gay Anglican minister, described Hendricks' death as ""truly heartbreaking"". The British-Nigerian LGBTQ rights activist runs House of Rainbow, an organisation that provides support for gay people in Nigeria where same-sex relationships or public displays of affection are illegal, and paid tribute to Hendricks' bravery. ""Your leadership, courage, and unwavering dedication to inclusive faith communities have left an indelible mark,"" he said. Sadiq Lawal, a gay Muslim man living in Nigeria, told the BBC that Hendricks, had made such an impact as he had made ""the impossible possible"" by saying the words: ""I'm a queer imam."" ""He's a mentor to many queer Muslims in Africa, especially in Nigeria, because of religious extremism,"" he said. ""I'm still in shock and devastated.""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm21r7qd16ro,Why Uganda's iconic crested crane faces extinction,2025-02-16T02:48:15.767Z,Wycliffe Muia,"With its distinctive golden crown, red throat pouch and slender black legs, the crested crane is beloved in Uganda - featuring on the East African nation's flag and coat of arms. All the country's national sports teams are also nicknamed after the iconic bird, but in recent years it has gone into decline and conservationists say it may face extinction if more is not done to protect it. The bird is protected by law - it stipulates a life sentence and/or a fine of 20bn Ugandan shillings ($5m; £4m) for those found to have killed one. Going back centuries, local Buganda cultural superstition also protected the elegant fowl, which was seen as a symbol of wealth, good fortune and longevity. It was believed that if one killed a crane, its kith and kin would flock to the killer's home, hold vigil and mourn by collectively honking until the person went mad or even died. ""Such stories instilled fear, and cranes would be respected and revered and not killed,"" Jimmy Muheebwa, a senior conservationist at Nature Uganda, a local non-governmental organisation (NGO), told the BBC. But for farmers in western Uganda, where the cranes mostly hang out, that fear has dissipated and often it is only conservationists who appear to know about the ban on killing them. ""I really don't see any value in these birds because all they do is raid our plantations and eat our crops. We are worried about food security in this area,"" Tom Mucunguzi, a maize farmer from a village near Mbarara city in Western Region, told the BBC. Another farmer near Mbarara, Fausita Aritua, agreed, saying when she goes to her maize plot she spends the whole day chasing away the cranes - and if she cannot get there, she tries to get someone else to stand guard. ""We no longer harvest as much as we used to do because these birds eat everything,"" she told the BBC. Also known as grey-crowned cranes, the birds are predominantly found in Uganda but are also in Kenya, Tanzania, Rwanda, Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo, Mozambique, South Africa and Zimbabwe. They are non-migratory, but make local and seasonal movements depending on food resources, nest site availability and the weather. Standing at about 1m (3.2ft) tall, the waterfowl mostly live in wetland areas - riverbanks, around dams and open grassland - where they breed and feed on grass seeds, small toads, frogs, insects and other invertebrates. But with the increasing human population, the high demand for food is pushing farmers to cultivate in wetlands, leaving crested cranes with diminishing areas to call home. ""In eastern Africa, the population has declined terribly by over 80% in the last 25 years,"" Adalbert Ainomucunguzi, who leads the International Crane Foundation (ICF) in East Africa, told BBC. In the1970s, Uganda boasted a population of more than 100,000 crested cranes, but today that number has dwindled to a mere 10,000, according to Nature Uganda. This decline saw the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) put the crested crane on its red list of endangered bird species in 2012. ""Despite its serenity, beauty and popularity, the bird is facing a serious threat. It means that if no urgent measures are taken to reverse this trend, we might see the cranes pushed to extinction,"" Dan Sseruge, a Ugandan ornithologist, told the BBC. Around Mbarara we found it was difficult to track down the birds - and only saw them early in the morning just after dawn. Conservationists say they used to be much easier to find in the landscape surrounding Mbarara. Dozens of cranes have in recent years been found dead after they were poisoned by rice and maize farmers in Lwengo district, in south-central Uganda. ""One of the biggest threats against cranes is poisoning by the farmers. This is because the birds are causing a lot of crop damage,"" Gilbert Tayebwa, a conservation officer at ICF, told BBC. Mr Tayebwa said he has been engaging farmers to use different deterrent methods like scarecrows to protect their crops from invading cranes. Farmers like Philip Ntare, from Lwengo, said the cranes were sometimes mistakenly poisoned after eating crops sprayed with agro-chemicals and other pesticides. ""I just chase them, because I grew up knowing the crested crane is not supposed to be killed. But government should consider compensating farmers for crop damage,"" he told the BBC. However, John Makombo, director of conservation at the Uganda Wildlife Authority (UWA), said this was not possible. ""It is one of those precious species that have freedom to go anywhere and so unfortunately the government is not liable for any damage done by the cranes,"" he told the BBC. Sarah Kugonza, an ICF conservationist, said the cranes also face a host of other threats - not just from farmers. Without the protective cover of the wetlands, their chicks are more likely to be captured by eagles. Cranes are finding day by day that they are living in an increasingly hostile environment. ""Sometimes breeding areas are flooded and nowadays some cranes are killed by electricity lines when flying,"" Ms Kugonza told BBC. Their exceptional beauty has also put them at risk as people are increasingly capturing them to be pets, according to Mr Ainomucunguzi. But crested cranes, who can live for just over two decades, hardly ever breed in captivity as the birds are famously faithful. ""It is a highly monogamous bird as it pairs once, for life. This means that if one of them is killed or domesticated, the likelihood of finding a new mating partner is almost zero,"" said Mr Muheebwa. They attract a mate by dancing, bowing and jumping - and are often seen walking as couples or families. A pair will define their own territory and can be very aggressive to defend it. Scientifically called Balearica regulorum gibbericeps, the cranes also have unique nesting patterns as they usually return to the same location annually, often laying between two and five eggs that are incubated by both sexes for anywhere between 28 and 31 days. Any destruction to these nesting areas impacts on these breeding patterns. Their monogamy has also attracted the unwelcome attention of local traditional healers, who claim that the parts of crested crane may bring faithfulness from a partner - or good luck. ""Some people have been caught hunting cranes to take some of their body parts to witch doctors in a belief that they will get rich. Or, if you are a woman, your husband will never leave you,"" Mr Tayebwa from ICF said. This is also something conservationists are trying to counter - as well as alerting people to the law protecting cranes. And in an effort to reverse declining numbers, the Ugandan government and conservationist groups are now rallying communities to restore wetlands. President Yoweri Museveni, who comes from the Western Region, has been urging encroachers to vacate wetland areas and, according to local media, has declared 2025 a year of wetland conservation. The ICF has also recruited custodians to monitor and ensure that the cranes' breeding grounds are protected. Nature Uganda's Mr Muheebwa said these efforts were slowly helping to stabilise the situation but crane numbers remained ""very low"". For Mr Makombo, the UWA's future emphasis is going to be on setting an example when it comes to the law. ""We shall arrest and prosecute those who are poisoning the cranes,"" he said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1m5dppk5xmo,Gunfire and looting in DR Congo city as rebels advance,2025-02-15T17:53:04.637Z,Alex Therrien,"Chaotic scenes have been unfolding in Bukavu in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo as the M23 rebel group continues its offensive in the region. On Saturday there were reports of sporadic gunfire and widespread looting in the city, including at a World Food Programme depot, with residents sheltering in their homes. It follows conflicting reports about whether the Rwanda-backed rebels had entered the key city of Bukavu, after advances in the region. On Friday M23 fighters seized Kavumu airport, north of Bukavu. The UN and the European Union have voiced alarm over the worsening conflict. A threat by Uganda's army chief to attack a Congolese town has sparked fears the conflict could flare into a wider regional war. UN secretary-general Antonio Guterres told an African Union summit on Saturday a regional escalation must be avoided ""at all costs"" and there was ""no military solution"". ""And the sovereignty and territorial integrity of the DRC must be respected,"" Guterres continued. The European Union said it was ""urgently"" considering all options following the news from Bukavu. ""The ongoing violation of the DRC's territorial integrity will not go unanswered,"" it warned. The Congolese government accuses Rwanda of sowing chaos in the region in order to benefit from its natural resources - a claim Rwanda has denied. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced from their homes in recent weeks as a result of the rebel advance. On Saturday, the streets of Bukavu were deserted as residents hid in their homes. One woman in the city told the BBC people were avoiding going outside as gunfire rang out and youths looted and destroyed shops. ""I only have enough food for three days. As a woman it is difficult for me to go outside because I could be raped [by the looters or the armed groups]. We feel abandoned by the authorities."" The looting included the World Food Programme's depot in Bukavu, which housed 6,800 metric tons of food, a spokesman for the UN aid agency told the Reuters news agency. Claude Kalinga said the stealing of supplies would deepen the difficulties faced by those in need. The agency had already suspended its activities for weeks due to the deteriorating security situation. There have been conflicting reports over whether M23 fighters have entered Bukavu, as the group claims, and to what extent. Two residents of the northern Bukavu suburb of Bagira said they had seen rebels on the streets and no sign of fighting. However, an M23 source, two Congolese army officers and multiple Bukavu residents, on Saturday told Reuters that the rebels had not yet entered the city centre. The capture of Bukavu, a city estimated to have an urban population of more than a million people, would represent an unprecedented expansion of territory under the M23's control since the latest insurgency started in 2022. Bukavu, which borders Rwanda, is on the southern tip of Lake Kivu and is an important transit point for the local mineral trade. Meanwhile, on Saturday, the chief of Uganda's defence forces, General Muhoozi Kainerugaba, said in a post on X he would attack the town of Bunia, also in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo, unless ""all forces"" there surrendered their arms within 24 hours, igniting fears of a wider conflict. The threat by Kainerugaba, whose father is the president of Uganda, adds to fears that the region risks slipping back into a broader war reminiscent of conflicts in the 1990s and 2000s which killed millions. Uganda's military since 2021 has supported the Congolese army in its fight against Islamist militants in the east, but UN experts say Uganda has also backed the M23 group.  The mineral-rich east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has been dogged by conflict for more than 30 years, since the 1994 Rwandan genocide. The instability has sucked in neighbouring countries to devastating effect – notoriously in the 1990s when two huge conflicts, dubbed Africa's World Wars, resulted in the deaths of millions of people."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgmj00zjrpo,DR Congo M23 rebels enter city of Bukavu,2025-02-15T00:01:48.157Z,Will Ross & Malu Cursino,"M23 rebels in the east of the Democratic Republic of Congo have entered Bukavu, the eastern region's second-largest city. Corneille Nangaa, leader of the Congo River Alliance which includes M23 rebels, told Reuters news agency the rebels had entered the South Kivu provincial capital on Friday evening and would continue their advance on Saturday. The Rwandan-backed militants' progress comes despite international calls for a ceasefire and a resumption of peace talks. Hundreds of thousands of people have been forced from their homes in recent weeks as a result of the rebel advance. Last month, the Tutsi-led M23, which is backed by neighbouring Rwanda, seized Goma, the main city in the mineral-rich east. The Congolese government accuses Rwanda of sowing chaos in the region in order to benefit from its resources, a claim Rwanda has denied. The M23 briefly captured Goma in a previous conflict in 2012, but the taking of Bukavu, which is the capital of South Kivu province, would represent a new phase in the turbulent recent history of the region. The city, which borders Rwanda, is on the southern tip of Lake Kivu and is an important transit point for the local mineral trade. Earlier on Friday, rebel fighters had entered the airport some 30km (19 miles) north of Bukavu, as the Congolese army and a militia allied with it withdrew without putting up much resistance. But there were heavy clashes on the outskirts of Bukavu, South Kivu's Deputy governor Jean Elekano, had told the BBC. In a village further north - Mayba - 70 bodies were found in a church, according to local media reports. A local community coordinator in North Kivu, Vianney Vitswamba, told the DR Congo news agency 7Sur7 that the bodies were found tied up. Allied Democratic Forces (ADF) rebels - an Islamic State-linked group - were blamed, but the BBC has not confirmed the report.  Residents of Bukavu contacted by the BBC said the authorities advised residents to remain indoors. Speaking at the Munich Security Conference, DR Congo's President Félix Tshisekedi called for Rwanda to be sanctioned, accusing it of having ""expansionist ambitions"", the AFP news agency reports. ""We will no longer put up with our strategic resources being plundered for the benefit of foreign interests under the complicit gaze of those who feed on chaos,"" he is quoted as saying. As well as being accused of backing the rebels, which Rwanda has denied, the country is also said to have its own troops in eastern DR Congo. Rwandan President Paul Kagame has said his country's priority is security. He has said Rwanda is in danger from Hutu rebels in DR Congo and has dismissed any threat of sanctions. The news of the latest advance comes as the continent's heads of state are due to meet at an African Union (AU) summit in Ethiopia on Saturday. The head of the AU commission, Moussa Faki Mahamat is quoted by AFP as saying that a ceasefire ""must be observed"" adding that ""military campaigns are not going to solve these problems. There is a general mobilisation of Africa today on this issue and I hope that we will be able to impose this ceasefire"". Additional reporting by Alfred Lasteck.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3d5jx0vzr4o,Liberian president suspends hundreds of officials over asset declaration failure,2025-02-14T11:25:07.735Z,Basillioh Rukanga,"Liberian President Joseph Boakai has suspended more than 450 top government officials for failing to declare their assets to the anti-corruption agency. They will be off work without pay for a month or ""until they submit the required declarations"", according to the presidency. Boakai said that the officials had contravened the code of conduct for state officials by not being transparent about what they own. The president, who had pledged to fight corruption when he came into office last year, said failure to comply undermined efforts to combat corruption and ensure accountability. The law requires all public officers to declare their wealth before taking up their posts and when they leave positions in government. The Liberia Anti-Corruption Commission (LACC) published the list of all the 457 affected public officials, noting it was doing so as prescribed by law. Boakai, who pledged to fight corruption when he came into office last year, said failure to comply undermined efforts to combat corruption and ensure accountability. ""Public officials are reminded that asset declaration is not only a legal obligation but also a fundamental measure to promote transparency and restore public trust in governmental institution,"" he said in a statement. Last July, the president announced that he was reducing his salary by 40%, saying he hoped to set a precedent for ""responsible governance"" and demonstrate ""solidarity"" with Liberians. The government of his predecessor, George Weah, had faced accusations of corruption and lavish spending, sparking mass protests amid a rise in the cost of living. On Wednesday, some of the suspended officials visited the anti-corruption commission offices in order to comply with the requirement. There has been mixed reaction over the president's move. Political analyst Abdullah Kiatamba was quoted by Liberian newspaper FrontPage Africa as being supportive of the president's anti-corruption stance, but raised concerns about the challenges some officials faced in submitting their asset declarations. Civil society group Solidarity and Trust for a New Day described Boakai's move as insufficient. ""Suspending these officials for just one month is a meaningless, symbolic gesture - a slap on the wrist that no serious person should take seriously,"" it said in a statement. Update 14 February: References to the ministers of health and education being among those censured have been removed as they said they had filed their declarations.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr46ydpp3ddo,DR Congo singer killed filming music video in war-torn Goma,2025-02-14T08:06:42.348Z,Emery Makumeno & Wycliffe Muia,"A popular Congalese musician has been killed while filming a music video in Goma, which was overrun by M23 militants, after releasing a song condemning the rebel occupation of the city. The body of Delphin Katembo Vinywasiki, better known as Delcat Idengo, was found in a street on Thursday with his head partially covered with blood. Unconfirmed reports say the artist was shot. Idengo, who was a critic of all sides in the conflict, was among hundreds of inmates who escaped from a prison in Goma, after the militants seized the city last month. The east of DR Congo has been engulfed in fighting as armed groups and the army battle it out for control of the mineral-rich region. It is not clear who was behind the killing. ""Justice will be done,"" government spokesperson Patrick Muyaya posted on X platform, terming the musician's killing an ""abominable act"". He blamed the M23. But the M23 pointed the finger at government-aligned forces, calling on them to hand over their weapons. The killing comes amid growing tension in the area after the Rwanda-backed M23 captured Goma, in a major escalation of the fighting in late January. Around 2,900 people have been killed and about 700,000 others forced from their homes in the recent hostilities, the latest UN figures suggest. The rebels are now pushing towards Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu - another key city in the region - despite regional peace efforts to end the conflict. Idengo's death has sparked fresh fears in North Kivu as protesters took to the streets of Beni, where he was born, to demand justice. Videos shared on social media showed the musician's body lying on the ground after the incident in the Kilijiwe area, in the north of Goma. According to the witnesses, Idengo, who was wearing military trousers for the video, died on the spot after the attack. The Congolese ministry of arts and culture described the incident as an ""assassination"". ""A committed voice, he carried, through his music, the aspirations and hopes of an entire generation,"" the ministry posted on X. Idengo was awaiting trail after his jailing last year for inciting people to take up arms and force UN peacekeepers to leave the country. In 2021, he was prosecuted for insulting President Félix Tshisekedi and spreading ""false rumours"" in one of his songs where he accused the president of not fulfilling his promises. He was sentenced to 10 years, but was later acquitted. ""The nation has lost a patriot committed to national cohesion. I mourn the loss of Idengo. It is high time for this war to end. Humanity above all!"" Martin Fayulu, an opposition leader who came third in the 2023 general election, posted on X. Moïse Katumbi, another opposition figure who came second in the election, condemned Idengo's killing. ""His murderers, whoever they are, must be quickly identified and very severely condemned,"" Katumbi posted on X. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg0xem34jno,Ghana's ex-finance minister declared a fugitive,2025-02-12T19:32:30.846Z,Thomas Naadi,"Ghana's former finance minister Ken Ofori-Atta has been declared a fugitive by prosecutors over his alleged involvement in multiple corruption cases when he was in government. Ofori-Atta had left Ghana to evade investigations, and all necessary steps would be taken to bring him back, Special Prosecutor Kissi Agyabeng said. Ofori-Atta has been accused of causing financial losses to the state, including over a controversial national cathedral, which remains a hole in the ground despite the alleged spending of $58m (£46.6m) of government money. Ofori-Atta has not commented on the allegations. According to Agyabeng, the ex-minister's lawyers said he was out of the country for medical reasons. Agyabeng told a press conference that Ofori-Atta, 66, failed to attend an interview with the Office of the Special Prosecutor (OSP), despite being told he was a suspect. Ofori-Atta left Ghana in early January, and had no intention of ""willingly"" returning, Agyabeng said. The OSP was, therefore, declaring him a ""wanted person"". ""He is a fugitive from justice,"" the special prosecutor added. Ofori-Atta was finance minister from January 2017 to February 2024, when the New Patriotic Party (NPP) was in power. It lost elections in December to the National Democratic Congress (NDC). President John Mahama, who was inaugurated in January, went on to establish an investigative committee known as Operation Recover All Loot. The committee has received over 200 complaints of corruption, amounting to more than $20bn in recoverable funds. Mahama has directed the attorney general and minister of justice to launch investigations into these allegations, stating that Ghana will no longer be a safe haven for corruption. However, some Ghanaians have criticised him for discontinuing cases against his former allies on trial.  Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce85x6w22gwo,Sudan fighters accused of storming famine-hit camp,2025-02-12T15:47:51.221Z,Barbara Plett Usher,"A paramilitary force in Sudan has stormed the country's largest displacement camp, looting and setting fire to the market and several homes, a local refugee group has said. The Zamzam camp in North Darfur has been hit by intense artillery shelling since late last year, but this is the first time the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has been accused of sending in fighters. An eyewitness told the BBC the situation at the camp was ""extremely catastrophic"", and there were many casualties. The nearby city of el-Fasher, one of the centres of the civil war that erupted in 2023, is already under siege by the RSF as it battles the army. The military and RSF had been allies - coming to power together in a coup - but fell out over an internationally backed plan to move towards civilian rule. The Sudanese IDPs and Refugees Bloc said Zamzam camp was invaded on Tuesday. However, an RSF spokesman denied its fighters had penetrated it, saying they had seized a nearby military base belonging to an armed group that fights alongside the Sudanese military, after it had shelled RSF checkpoints for days. BBC Verify has confirmed social media footage that shows men waving guns triumphantly with flames behind them and saying they are in the camp. The insignia has been removed from their uniforms, but the man filming the video has RSF markings. Asked about the damage to the market the RSF spokesman said the group had ""circulated a message in which we committed to protect the camp residents and asked them to stay away from the fire exchange areas"".  Zamzam hosts about half a million displaced people who were already suffering from famine. Reports said the attack forced thousands of them to flee again. Medical charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), which runs a hospital in Zamzam, said it had received seven dead bodies and 21 injured people at the hospital it runs in Zamzam. Most of them were in a serious condition, but the hospital lacked the ability to care for all of them, an MSF spokesperson added. The eyewitness the BBC spoke to said the hospital no longer had a functioning surgery. North Darfur's Health Minister Ibrahim Abdullah Khater told the BBC that the wounded were not able to reach el-Fasher for treatment because the RSF was blocking the road and preventing access to the city. ""The ones suffering the most are the displaced people,"" he said. The humanitarian catastrophe worsened late last year when Zamzam came under heavy artillery fire, which aid organisations, including MSF, blamed on the RSF. A group of international non-governmental organisations issued a statement in December, saying the attacks on Zamzam marked ""an escalation in violence on a site which has previously been spared from active hostilities"", although it was ""consistent with a pattern of attacks"" on other camps for displaced people. ""This underscores the reality that there are now no safe places for people to flee to in North Darfur,"" it said. The siege of el-Fasher began last April - a year into the conflict. It is the only city still under army control in Darfur, where the RSF has been accused of carrying out ethnic cleansing against non-Arab communities.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgy0d3pgv0o,US aid pause hits DR Congo humanitarian work - UN,2025-02-12T13:58:21.152Z,Wedaeli Chibelushi,"A pause in US foreign aid has ""severely impacted"" humanitarian efforts in conflict-hit Democratic Republic of Congo, a senior UN official in the country has said. Bruno Lemarquis told reporters that DR Congo was the largest recipient of US humanitarian assistance last year - 70% of the African country's aid had come from Washington. US President Donald Trump's decision to pause all international aid was, therefore, a ""major source of concern"", Mr Lemarquis said. The suspension comes as intense clashes between the Rwandan-backed M23 rebel group and DR Congo's army worsen an already dire humanitarian crisis. Approximately 700,000 people are said to have been forced from their homes since the fighting escalated last month. In Goma, a city captured by the M23 last month, residents told the BBC of damaged livelihoods and hospitals overwhelmed by those injured in conflict. The risk of epidemics such as cholera and mpox were also high in Goma, Mr Lemarquis said during Tuesday's briefing. He added that an increased number of residents needed food aid as prices had risen, but the US pause on foreign aid hindered agencies from tackling these issues. ""Our ultra dependence on US funding means a lot of programmes had to shut down on everything we are doing. So, it's emergency health, it is emergency shelter."" Mr Lemarquis said. President Trump froze all foreign assistance provided by the United States, by far the world's biggest aid donor, on his first day back in office, calling for a review to ensure it abided by his ""America First"" foreign policy. Trump's administration has targeted the government's main overseas aid agency, USAID, saying its spending is totally unexplainable. The dramatic suspension of humanitarian assistance has hit programmes across the world - one veteran humanitarian worker told the BBC the pause was ""like an earthquake across the aid sector"". Pepfar, a ground-breaking US programme countering the global spread of HIV, is among those that have been heavily impacted. ""The program is shuttered…. Services are shut,"" Dr Atul Gawande, the former Assistant Administrator for Global Health at USAID, told the BBC last month. He said clinics that served 20 million people with HIV were affected. And in Syria, water, sanitation and security services were all upended at the al-Hol displacement camp following Trump's directive. Critical services have also been hit in Afghanistan, a country whose health sector receives a huge portion of its funding from the US. A doctor responsible for USAID-funded projects there told the BBC that more than 60 of his team, including midwives, nurses and doctors, were told to stay at home after funding was paused. ""If the funding halt continues, mothers will be forced to give birth at home as the facilities are closed and it will increase mortality rates,"" one midwife said.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rqe85q1jno,"Oil clean-up 'scam' warnings ignored by Shell, whistleblower tells BBC",2025-02-12T01:24:41.327Z,Simi Jolaoso,"A BBC investigation has uncovered allegations that energy giant Shell has ignored repeated warnings that a controversial clean-up operation of oil-polluted areas of southern Nigeria has been beset by problems and corruption. The multinational headquartered in London, along with the Nigerian government, has repeatedly stated that work to clean up oil-contaminated sites of Ogoniland, which kicked off around eight years ago, is going well. But the BBC has discovered evidence that they were warned repeatedly over several years that the scheme, set up by the government and funded by various oil firms to the tune of $1bn (£805m), has been suffering from a string of issues. One close observer has described the clean-up project as a ""con"" and a ""scam"" that has wasted money and left the people of Ogonliland, which lies in the Niger Delta, continuing to live with the devastating impact of oil pollution - 13 years after a ground-breaking UN report lifted the lid on the seriousness of their situation. Shell's Nigerian subsidiary told the BBC: ""The operating environment in the Niger Delta remains challenging because of the huge scale of illegal activities such as oil theft. ""When spills do happen from our facilities we clean up and remediate, regardless of the cause. If it's an operational spill, we also compensate people and communities."" The allegations come as a civil trial is expected to begin on Thursday at the High Court in London, where lawyers representing two Ogoniland communities of around 50,000 inhabitants will say Shell must take responsibility for oil pollution that occurred between 1989 and 2020, allegedly from its infrastructure. The communities say the spills have left them without clean water, unable to farm and fish, and created serious risks to public health. Shell, which has been pushing to sell its assets in the West African country to focus on offshore drilling and onshore gas, has indicated it will defend the claims. It denies wrongdoing and says spills in the region have been caused by sabotage, theft and illegal refining for which the company says it is not liable. The BBC has visited the affected areas in the Niger Delta, where Shell, the largest private oil and gas company in the country, discovered the existence of crude oil 68 years ago. The UN says at least 13 million barrels - or 1.5 million tonnes - of crude oil have been spilled since 1958 in at least 7,000 incidents in the Niger Delta region. The spills have left many families worried for their health and livelihoods. Grace Audi, 37, lives with her partner and two-year-old in Ogale in Rivers state, where there have been at least 40 oil spills from Shell's infrastructure, according to Leigh Day, the UK-law firm representing the communities in this case. Her family and neighbours only have access to a contaminated borehole, forcing them to buy clean water to use for drinking, cooking, washing and, once a day, flushing, at a cost of 4,500 Nigerian naira ($3, £2.40) - in an area where the average daily wage is less than $8. It is a familiar story to many in Niger Delta's Rivers state. Paulina Agbekpekpe told the BBC that lush greenery once surrounded thriving mangroves of her community in Bodo - which is not one of those going to court on Thursday. She said the rivers and ponds used to brim with all kinds of animals and fish, particularly periwinkle. ""The place was greener, not only mangroves, but all by the shoreline - there were pawpaw trees, palm trees and more. But during the spills, the destruction has polluted everywhere,"" the 50-year-old mother of six said. Her family had for generations survived on fishing, until a devastating spill 10 years ago. ""Most of the children - from the drinking water - have got diseases. Many have died. I've lost eight kids. My husband is sick. ""Because our livelihoods have been taken away, people in Bodo are hungry and suffering."" In 2011, the UN's Environment Programme (UNEP) published a major study into the impact of pollution on the oil-rich area. It found members of one community in Ogoniland were drinking water contaminated with a known carcinogen at levels more than 900 times above the World Health Organization (WHO) guideline. The same chemical, benzene, was detected in all their air samples. It also found that sites that Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, the Shell Petroleum Development Company of Nigeria (SPDC), claimed to have remediated, were still polluted and the techniques they used did not reach regulatory requirements. The report concluded that a comprehensive clean-up of the area would take 25-30 years - and it led to the formation of the Hydrocarbon Pollution Remediation Project (Hyprep). This was initially established by the Nigerian government in 2012, but no clean-up was started - until it was relaunched by a new government in December 2016. Hyprep was part-funded by oil companies including the state-owned Nigerian National Petroleum Company (NNPC) and Shell, which gave $350m. However, the BBC has seen internal documents that suggest representatives of Shell and of the Nigerian government were warned numerous times of the agency's alleged fraudulent practices. One person aware of the project spoke to the BBC about their concerns - and asked to remain anonymous out of a fear of reprisals. ""It's common knowledge that really what we're doing is a scam. Most of it is to fool the Ogoni people,"" the whistleblower said. ""It's a con perpetuated so that more money can be put into the pot and end up in the pockets of politicians and other people in power."" The allegations about failings at Hyprep include: In the minutes of one meeting in 2023, attended by representatives from Shell's Nigerian subsidiary, the UNEP and Hyprep, it was pointed out that ""incompetent"" contractors were ""being engaged again"" and that they should ""not be allowed to further degrade the environment"". In a separate leaked report seen by the BBC from the same year, it was pointed out that laboratory results were ""regularly reported with deviations"". In 2022, the UN wrote to the Nigeria's environment ministry, warning that if nothing changed, the ""extremely poor standards"" of the clean-up would continue. The BBC has asked Hyprep and the Nigerian government to comment on the allegations but has received no response. But our investigation has revealed evidence that Shell was aware of the problems. In a meeting with the British high commissioner to Nigeria in January last year, minutes of which were obtained under the Freedom of Information Act, Shell representatives acknowledged the ""institutional challenges"" of the clean-up agency and the chance of the refusal of ""future funding"" towards it. Shell told the BBC: ""Hyprep is an agency established and overseen by the federal government of Nigeria, with its governing council largely made up of senior ministers and government officials, along with five representatives of communities and NGOs and a single SPDC representative."" This is not the only remediation project in the Niger Delta that is alleged to have been botched. In 2015, Shell agreed to a £55m settlement for a clean-up after two catastrophic spills in 2008 from its infrastructure in the area Bodo. The company said the clean-up, conducted by the Bodo Mediation Initiative (BMI), which is meant to serve as a mediator between oil companies, including Shell, and the Bodo community (and is part-funded by the oil giant and Nigerian regulators) has been certified as 98% complete. However, the BBC visited sites within the area and found crude oil oozing from the soil and floating on waters. Shell and the BMI insist any occurrences of oil spills in the region are because of theft - known in the industry as ""oil bunkering"". ""There is a plan to call back the contractors to clean those areas to specification, to standard,"" Boniface Dumpe, a director at the BMI, told the BBC. ""It is the responsibility of all stakeholders, Shell, yes, to take care of their facilities, to ensure that re-oiling does not come from their facilities. ""But for the areas that have been cleaned. I would think that some responsibility is also for the community to ensure that some illegal activities does not also cause re-pollution."" Shell said it takes active measures to prevent oil spills caused by oil bunkering. The company said: ""We take extensive steps to prevent this activity and the spills it causes including aerial surveillance, removing illegal connections on pipelines, and by building steel cages to protect wellheads."" The alleged failings in the oil clean-up come as Shell prepares to sell its Nigerian subsidiary, the SPDC, to Renaissance Africa, a consortium of local and international companies. Some locals have accused the oil giant of ""running away"" from properly cleaning up the land and waters it is alleged to have polluted. They also fear Shell may still profit from the area by simply trading the oil extracted from the region in future. ""The operations of whichever oil operator takes over the relevant pipelines will have an enormous impact on their day-to-day life,"" Joe Snape, a lawyer at Leigh Day, told the BBC. ""There's incredibly little detail about what these deals will lead to. ""It is unclear how Renaissance [Africa] will act going forward. At least with Shell we have means of holding them to account."" Mineral products, like petroleum oil and gas, account for 90% of exports from Nigeria, most of which comes from the Niger Delta region. Locals, whose main source of livelihood has been agriculture and fishing, told the BBC that since the discovery of oil, or what some refer to as ""black gold"", their home had been pumped for profit - by major oil companies, by oil thieves and by corrupt politicians. They say they have seen no benefit, only suffering - like Patience Ogboe who blames recent oil spills in Rivers state for her failing crops. ""Formerly if I harvest I can eat some with my family and even sell some… but for the past few years I could not get anything. It's really bad,"" the 42-year-old the BBC.

Heavy shelling began on Tuesday morning, three days after a summit of East and Southern African leaders called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire. The rebels have seized vast swathes of land in the eastern DR Congo, including the major city of Goma. They are now pushing towards Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu - another key city in the region. Around 2,900 people have been killed since early January as a result of the hostilities, the latest UN figures suggest. Approximately 700,000 others are estimated to have been forced from their homes and thousands more injured. Tuesday's fighting erupted near Ihusi, a locality around 70km (43 miles) from Bukavu and 40km from the South Kivu's airport, security sources told news agency AFP. A spokesperson for the Congo River Alliance (known by its French acronym AFC), an alliance of rebel groups including the M23, suggested its fighters could take their battle to Bukavu. Lawrence Kanyuka responded to the arrests by the Congolese authorities of 84 army personnel for crimes such as killing civilians near Bukavu, saying: ""If these crimes persist, we will take full responsibility to eradicate the threat at its source and protect our people"". Meanwhile, reports say that hundreds and thousands of refugees, who have fled the ongoing fighting, were being forced to return home by the M23. The M23 has denied this allegation, but French broadcaster RFI reported that several large camps for displaced people have been dismantled and their inhabitants made to trek back to their villages in conflict zones. Ocha, the UN's humanitarian agency, said the M23 had given displaced people in Goma 72 hours to return to home. Mr Kanyuka said such reports were ""propaganda"" and that displaced people were returning voluntarily. The M23 ""does not compel anyone to return without firm security guarantees"", he said. The M23, which is made up of ethnic Tutsis, say they are fighting for minority rights, while DR Congo's government says the rebels are seeking control of the eastern region's vast mineral wealth. DR Congo and the UN accused Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated government of backing the M23 - an allegation which Kigali has persistently denied. But recently, the official response has shifted, with government spokespeople stating that fighting near its border is a security threat.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz7ed71g0xwo,Huge data price hike sparks anger in Nigeria,2025-02-11T14:09:33.759Z,Mansur Abubakar,"Nigerians are expressing outrage over a big jump in the price of mobile data charged by some of the country's major phone networks. MTN - Nigeria's largest operator - trebled the cost of one of its most popular weekly offers. Airtel has also increased its tariffs. A price jump was expected as the telecoms regulatory body had approved an increase, but in an announcement three weeks ago it said it had capped it at 50%. The phone companies wanted to boost their revenue in order to cover rising costs. Nigerians have been living through a long cost-of-living crisis with inflation rates not seen for three decades. Any increase in prices adds to the struggle for many to make ends meet. In response to customer complaints, MTN said on X that the price adjustment was necessary to serve subscribers better. ""We apologize for any inconvenience caused,” the company added. Airtel is yet to comment. Subscribers only realised what had happened when they went to buy data over the past few hours. The BBC has contacted Airtel for more information on the changes. Many comments on social media called out the increase saying that it could cut off a lot of people at a time when the economy is in turmoil. One target for criticism has been the rise in MTN's 15GB weekly bundle from 2,000 naira ($1.33; £1.08) to 6,000 naira ($3.99). ""What sort of outrageous increase is that?... Just making sure the masses suffer more,"" one commenter on X said. ""Triple the amount? The end time is near,"" another wrote. Subscribers are also complaining that MTN's 1GB bundle has more than doubled in price and Airtel has trebled the cost of a similar offer. People who use Globacom - the third largest network - say they have not been affected by increases. The Nigeria Communications Commission, which regulates the telecom companies, is yet to react to the price rises which in some cases appear to exceed the cap that it had recommended. Digital content creator Mubarak Uniquepikin told the BBC that the tariff hike could have a major impact for businesses that depend on being online. ""The economy is already comatose and for this to come in now when a lot of people can't rent shops and have taken their business online is bad,"" he said. ""Many young people already find it difficult to buy data and this would definitely make it worse for them."" Nigeria is experiencing its worst economic crisis in a generation. A rise in inflation caused by the war in Ukraine was exacerbated when in 2023 President Bola Tinubu's government dropped the fuel subsidy. The authorities also followed a policy of currency devaluation. Both measures were intended to restore long-term stability, but in the meantime many people have suffered.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gz4gdr1zgo,Detained Ugandan politician starts hunger strike,2025-02-11T12:41:53.050Z,Swaibu Ibrahim,"Detained Ugandan opposition politician Kizza Besigye has begun a hunger strike as his time spent in detention awaiting trial nears three months. Besigye, 68, was charged in a military court with possession of pistols and attempting to purchase weapons abroad - accusations which he denies. On Tuesday, an aide from Besigye's political movement, the People's Front for Freedom (PFF), told the BBC: ""We believe he is protesting because he should not still be in prison - he should be home."" Besigye's trial was initially postponed until January - it is now unclear when the court case will begin. Besigye used to be a personal doctor for Uganda's longtime president, Yoweri Museveni, but went on to become an opposition leader. He has contested and lost four presidential elections against Museveni, who has been in power since 1986. The veteran opposition figure has previously accused the Ugandan authorities of political persecution. He has been less active in politics in recent years, and did not contest the 2021 election. However, Besigye returned to the headlines last month after he was dramatically abducted while visiting Kenya and forcibly taken to Uganda. The detention sparked widespread condemnation and fears of a clandestine exchange of intelligence between the two neighbours. Besigye was then charged along with an aide, Obeid Lutale. Mr Lutale also denied the charges. In a landmark ruling last month, Uganda's Supreme Court declared it unconstitutional for military courts to try civilians, ordering the transfer of all such cases to civilian courts. The move angered President Museveni, who dismissed it as ""a wrong decision"" and vowed to challenge the ruling. Besigye has had various other run-ins with the law. On Tuesday, the opposition politician was expected to appear before a civilian court for a hearing on a 2022 case in which he is accused of holding an unlawful demonstration. However, he did not attend the hearing, citing health reasons. In 2005, Besigye was arrested while returning from a political rally ahead of the 2006 presidential polls and charged with treason. The charges were thrown out by the courts. He was also charged with rape in a separate case. The charges were later dropped. He said all the allegations were part of a campaign of political persecution. Museveni has defended the use of military courts to try civilians. He said any crime involving a gun was dealt with in a military court to ensure the country's stability as civilian courts took too long to deal with cases. Opposition parties have frequently complained about restrictions on political activities, alleging that Museveni fears political competition. Museveni's supporters deny the allegation, and say he has maintained stability during his rule of almost 40 years.  Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj91dmxz7x9o,South Sudan president sacks top leaders and spy chief,2025-02-11T10:46:33.983Z,Nichola Mandil,"South Sudan's President Salva Kiir has sacked two of his vice-presidents, the country's spy chief and other senior officials. The dismissals were announced in a series of presidential decrees read on the state broadcaster. No reasons were given for the move. South Sudan has five vice-presidents as part of a 2018 peace agreement to end a civil war. The oil-rich nation became the world's newest country in 2011 after seceding from Sudan - but it was then engulfed by civil war after Kiir and his deputy Riek Machar fell out. The 2018 power-sharing agreement has been fraught with problems. One of the vice-president removed from office is James Wani Igga, a veteran politician and general, who has been in the position since 2013 and has been the deputy chair of SPLM, the party of the president. The other is Hussein Abdelbagi Akol, from an opposition alliance (SSOA) which is not part of the main opposition movement (SPLM-In Opposition) of First Vice-President Riek Machar. Akol has been appointed the minister for agriculture, replacing Josephine Joseph Lagu from the same SSOA alliance who now becomes a vice-president. Benjamin Bol Mel, who was sanctioned by the US in 2017 for alleged corruption, has been appointed to replace Igga as vice-president. Mel, previously a special presidential envoy for special programmes, has been the subject of speculation that he was being fronted as a potential successor of Kiir. The president has not appointed replacements for the health minister and the governor of the south-western state of Western Equatoria, who are both from Machar's party. He has also not appointed a substantive replacement for the sacked spy chief, Akec Tong Aleu, who had only served four months after having been appointed in October. The 2018 peace deal gives the president prerogative to appoint and dismiss government officials at both national and state level. He can only appoint and dismiss officials who belong to other political parties with the consent of the leadership of those parties. It is not clear whether the dismissal of Western Equatoria governor and the health minister were recommended by their party leader, Machar. The SPLM-In Opposition has not commented on the matter. South Sudan has not conducted an election since independence. The first nationwide vote was scheduled to take place in 2015, but the election could not go ahead due to the conflict that erupted in December 2013. It was then supposed to happen in 2022, but polls were postponed for two years and were due two months ago. The vote was postponed again, and the country's leadership said the election will now take place in December 2026. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpdx3wj9dp2o,Why some Ghanaians are fighting in insurgency-hit Burkina Faso,2025-02-11T02:15:30.857Z,Ed Butler,"Three Ghanaians have told the BBC of their involvement in the fighting between Islamist insurgents and the military in neighbouring Burkina Faso, describing scenes of sometimes indiscriminate violence and bloody battles. ""We are always with the dead. In some battles, I've seen 40, 50 or 100 dead people,"" one of the men told the BBC. The three, all in their late thirties or early forties, said they had fought in Burkina Faso multiple times since 2018. They crossed the porous 550km-long (340-mile) border between the two countries, without being detected by the security forces. They denied being primarily motivated by religion or being trained by the jihadists, saying they went to fight to defend civilian communities with whom they had strong family and ethnic ties. ""My elder brother, his wife and children were all killed by the [Burkinabe] army. It pains me a lot. The military came to their community in the forest. They killed all of them, a whole household, including 29 people,"" one of the men said. But another of the men did articulate religious zeal, saying: ""If you die while fighting with the jihadists, then you are driving to jannah (an Islamic word for paradise), on the path of the righteous."" Challenged over whether they had taken part in civilian attacks, the men were divided. One denied doing so, but another conceded that he did. ""Some local people support the military in attacking us, that's why we have to kill them too,"" he said. ""You know... I'm not happy to fight like this. The number of people we kill, the people the military kill, it's very bad. But this fight has entered our blood,"" he added. All three spoke on condition of anonymity. The BBC was unable to confirm their claims but they showed us pictures of weapons, described the location of recent conflicts and named jihadist commanders in Burkina Faso. The BBC was put in touch with the men through contacts at cattle markets in northern Ghana, where jihadist groups are alleged to be recruiting fighters. In 2022, a France-based NGO, Promediation, said its research showed that the jihadists had recruited between 200 and 300 young Ghanaians. And the Netherlands Institute of International Relations think-tank, in a report released last July, said the jihadists had ""minimal success"" recruiting in Ghana. However, the men offered a different perspective, telling the BBC, in claims that could not be verified, that people from ""all parts of Ghana"" and from ""many"" ethnic groups were joining the insurgency in Burkina Faso. ""Some are fighting for jihad. Some are doing it for business,"" one of them said. The financial incentive comes in the form of the plentiful livestock that the jihadists steal from communities driven out of their villages. ""When we attack a community, we take their animals: sometimes 50, sometimes 100,"" the BBC was told by one of the men. The cattle are allegedly brought to northern Ghana, and sold at markets. The trafficking across the border was confirmed to the BBC by cattle dealers. It is thought to have become a major income stream for groups like Jama'at Nusrat ul-Islam wa al-Muslimin (JNIM), an al-Qaeda affiliate that is the most active jihadist group in Burkina Faso. It also operates in Niger and Mali. The West African region was described by the UN last year as the epicentre of global jihadist violence. Aid agencies say that over the last decade some two-million people have been displaced by the insurgency in Burkina Faso and tens of thousands killed. Ninpoa Nasuri is one of the thousands who have fled to Ghana to escape the violence. She told the BBC her husband was killed in front of her in 2024 during a raid on their village in eastern Burkina Faso by fighters from JNIM. ""They grabbed the men, and they beat them to death. My husband was a farmer. He had nothing to do with the government militia or the conflict,"" she told the BBC. Other refugees described similar acts of violence by the Burkinabe military. ""Some of the people they were killing were aged 80, aged 90. These people can't hold a gun, can't fight with anybody. They killed them for no reason,"" Saafiya Karim said. Ghana has so far remained largely untouched by the insurgency, although some attacks have taken place in neighbouring Togo and Ivory Coast. In a recent statement to Ghanaian journalist Mohammed Eliasu Tanko, a man calling himself a representative of JNIM said the group had no interest in launching attacks in Ghana. ""They (JNIM fighters) are not allowed to take any action against Ghana. This is a clear and certain statement. JNIM do not seek war against Ghana,"" the man, known as Ansari, said in the statement, which the BBC has seen. However an upsurge in communal violence in one part of northern Ghana has raised concerns that the jihadists are trying to exploit the conflict to their advantage. The town of Bawku is embroiled in a decades-long struggle between different ethnic groups for control of the local chieftaincy. More than 100 people are thought to have been killed in clashes since fighting intensified in last October. ""The evening in Bawku is always [one of] gunshots and fierce exchanges. People use AK47s, M16s, all kinds of automatic rifles,"" a resident told the BBC. JNIM smugglers are accused of selling weapons to both sides. ""We understand they are supplying weapons that they have taken from the military in Burkina Faso. They do this by relying on the trucks that travel up to Niger and back carrying onions. They hide the weapons inside those trucks,"" Tanko told the BBC. ""One intelligence officer confirmed to me this was the new way they are bringing firearms in. And the Ghanaian security are ill-equipped to be able to detect these vehicles coming through, putting Ghana in a very critical situation,"" he added. Ghana's Defence Minister Edward Omane Boamah did not respond to a BBC request for comment. President John Mahama, who took office in January after winning December's presidential election, visited Bawku last month in an effort to promote peace between the rival groups. However, gunfights continue to be reported. Ghana's governing party spokesman Sammy Gyamfi told the BBC that ending the violence in Bawku was the government's ""number one priority"". ""The violence is already spreading and if care is not taken it's likely that insurgents from the wider region can take advantage of this conflict,"" he said. The three men the BBC spoke to said they did not rule out the possibility of the insurgency spreading. ""This thing can go to any place, or to any country. It didn't exist in Togo but now the attacks are happening there. If they can go to Togo, they can get to Ghana. This thing is strong, it's powerful,"" one of them said. But another of the men took a cynical perspective, saying the insurgents in Burkina Faso were no longer waging an ""Islamic struggle"". ""They just kill the people, and steal their livestock. What is happening is not jihad and so I do not like it,"" he said. You can listen to Ed Butler's report on the BBC World Service's Assignment programme.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qj9yrn5lyo,South Africa mourns pioneering female nuclear scientist,2025-02-10T16:36:54.981Z,Danai Nesta Kupemba,"South Africa's first black female nuclear scientist, Senamile Masango, a trailblazer who set out to inspire young women, has died aged 37, the government has confirmed. Ms Masango, dubbed ""the queen of science"" by some in South Africa, passed away on Sunday. The cause of her death is unknown. Headstrong and ambitious, she ""was a beacon of hope for many young people, especially women"", a statement from Deputy President Paul Mashatile said. Despite her success she said she faced discrimination as a black woman as she constantly had to prove that she knew what she was talking about. Nevertheless, her unwavering determination earned her deep respect in her field. Ms Masango was the first African woman to join an African-led team conducting experiments at the European Organisation for Nuclear Research (Cern), which is the world's largest particle physics laboratory. ""Masango's tireless efforts to promote science education and empowerment, particularly among women and disadvantaged communities, will be deeply missed,"" a statement from South Africa's Department of Science, Technology and Innovation said. Born in 1987 in the rural village of Nongoma, KwaZulu-Natal, the historical seat of the Zulu monarchy, Ms Masango's mother was a princess in the royal family, and her father was a prominent figure. She grew up in a polygamous family, with her mother being the youngest of three wives. It was a challenging family set-up, she told local newspaper Sowetan Live, but she learned how to stand up for herself. Her parents quickly recognised her early passion for learning and encouraged her to read extensively. At 11, her geography teacher spoke about astronauts, sparking a lifelong interest in science. ""I was so fascinated to learn that there are people who travel to space - leave this dimension - and go to the moon,"" she told Global Citizen, an organisation dedicated to ending extreme poverty. ""That's when I fell in love with science."" Ms Masango enrolled at the University of Zululand at 16 to study physics, but after becoming pregnant and failing some modules, she had to drop out. With her family's support, she returned to complete her degree and later earned an MSc in nuclear physics at the University of the Western Cape, graduating with distinction. Tragically, her daughter died in a car crash aged seven. Beyond her academic accomplishments, Ms Masango established a foundation dedicated to encouraging young women to pursue science. ""Girls are discouraged at an early age from taking science subjects; it is the root cause of the lack of women in the nuclear space,"" she said. Her remarkable achievements included being named one of South Africa's most successful black women scientists under 35 in 2019 and earning a spot on the Mail & Guardian's 200 Young South Africans in Science and Technology list. In 2022, she received the prestigious International Women in Science Award, recognising her profound impact on the scientific community. But throughout her career, Ms Masango faced misogynoir - the discrimination black women face because of their race and gender. ""The biggest challenge in my career is my skin colour. If you look like me, no-one believes in you; you must prove that you know your job and that you can think!"" ""There are still very few black women scientists. This means women like me have to work twice as hard to prove their worth,"" she said. Yet, she persevered, using her journey to help inspire a new generation to pursue science fearlessly and boldly.

The Sudanese army has been regaining control of areas in the city previously held by the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in recent weeks. Army leader Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan told a meeting of politicians who back the army over the weekend that he would form a ""technocratic"" wartime government with a prime minister. He insisted there would be no negotiations with the RSF. The two sides have been fighting for approaching two years - a conflict that has forced 12 million from their homes and left many starving. Gen Burhan also said there would be a new constitution prior to the formation of the transitional government. ""We can call it a caretaker government, a wartime government, but it's a government that will help us complete what remains of our military objectives, which is freeing Sudan from these rebels,"" he said on Saturday. A statement by the foreign ministry on Sunday called on ""the international community, particularly the United Nations, the African Union, and the Arab League, to support the roadmap presented by the state as a national consensus for establishing peace and stability and completing the tasks of the transition"". The army and the RSF, which once worked together, have since been involved in a vicious power struggle. The ongoing war, in which tens of thousands have been killed, broke out in April 2023 after Gen Burhan and RSF head Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo fell out over the future shape of the government. The conflict has created one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, according to international aid agencies. Both the army and the RSF have been accused of committing grave atrocities against civilians, with their leaders being sanctioned by the US. In addition, the RSF has been accused of carrying out a genocide in the Darfur area. Both forces deny the accusations. In recent weeks, the army has had huge victories against the RSF in the capital and Gezira state. The paramilitary force has retreated from these areas overpowered by the army's expanded air power as well as ground support by allied militias. It however still controls most of the west of the country, where intense conflict has been going on as it seeks to consolidate its control of the Darfur region.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgq0gxp04q2o,The DR Congo rebel leader whose fighters have created turmoil,2025-02-10T02:46:28.239Z,Wedaeli Chibelushi,"The Democratic Republic of Congo is in turmoil - fighters from the notorious M23 rebel group have been surging through the country's east, battling the national army and capturing key places as they go. In just a fortnight, thousands of people are said to have been killed and the fighting has sparked an ominous war of words between DR Congo and its neighbour, Rwanda. So how did DR Congo - the largest country in sub-Saharan Africa - get here? The origins of this complex conflict can be understood through the story of one man - M23 leader Sultani Makenga, who is the subject of various war crime allegations. He is sanctioned by the US of using child soldiers, which he has denied. The UN has accused him of being responsible for sexual violence. To go back through Makenga's life so far is to look into decades of warfare, intermittent foreign intervention and the persistent lure of DR Congo's rich mineral resources. His life began on Christmas Day in 1973, when he was born in the lush Congolese town of Masisi. Raised by parents of the Tutsi ethnic group, Makenga quit school at the age of 17 to join a Tutsi rebel outfit across the border in Rwanda. This group, named the Rwandan Patriotic Front (RPF), were demanding greater Tutsi representation in Rwanda's government, which at the time was dominated by politicians from the Hutu majority. They also wanted the hundreds and thousands of Tutsi refugees who had been forced from the country by ethnic violence to be able to return home. For four years, Makenga and the RPF fought the Hutu-dominated army in Rwanda. Their battle was enmeshed with the 1994 genocide, when Hutu extremists killed 800,000 Tutsis and moderate Hutus. When looking back at this time in a rare 2013 interview, Makenga stated: ""My life is war, my education is war, and my language is war... but I do respect peace."" The RPF gradually seized more and more land before marching into Rwanda's capital, Kigali, and overthrowing the extremist Hutu government - many of whom fled into what is now DR Congo. With the RPF in power, Makenga was absorbed into the official Rwandan army and rose to the rank of sergeant and deputy platoon commander. ""He was very good at setting up ambushes,"" one of Makenga's fellow RPF fighters told the Rift Valley Institute non-profit research organisation. His progress in the Rwandan army hit a ceiling however. The fact that he only had a basic education and spoke broken French and English was ""an obstacle to his military career"", the Rift Valley Institute said. Makenga is also said - to this day - to be very reserved and to struggle with public speaking. In 1997, he was part of the Rwanda-backed forces who ended up seizing power in DR Congo, ousting long-serving ruler Mobutu Sese Seko. In his place they installed veteran Congolese rebel leader Laurent Kabila. However, Makenga began to clash with his superiors - he was arrested by the Rwandan authorities after refusing orders to return to Rwanda, a UN Security Council report said. He was therefore imprisoned for several years on the island of Iwawa. Meanwhile, relations between Kabila and Rwanda's new leaders deteriorated. Rwanda had sought to crush the Hutu militiamen who were responsible for the genocide but had fled across the border in 1994. Rwanda's fear was that they could return and upset the country's hard-won stability. But Kabila had failed to stop the militants from organising and he also started to force out Rwandan troops. As a result, Rwanda invaded DR Congo in 1998. When Makenga was released from prison, he was appointed to serve as a commander on the front line with a Rwanda-backed rebel group. Over the years, he gained a reputation for being highly strategic and skilled at commanding large groups of soldiers into battle. After Rwandan troops crossed into DR Congo, there was a surge in discrimination against the Tutsi community. Kabila alleged that Tutsis supported the invasion, while other officials incited the public to attack members of the ethnic group. Makenga - still in DR Congo - accused the Congolese leader of betraying Tutsi fighters, saying: ""Kabila was a politician, while I am not. I am a soldier, and the language that I know is that of the gun."" Several neighbouring countries had been drawn into the conflict and a large UN military force was deployed to try to maintain order. More than five million people are believed to have died in the war and its aftermath - mostly from starvation or disease. The fighting officially ended in 2003 but Makenga continued to serve in armed groups opposed to the Congolese government. In the spirit of reconciliation, Tutsi rebels like Makenga were eventually amalgamated into the Congolese government's armed forces, in a process called ""mixage"". But the political sands in DR Congo are ever shifting - Makenga eventually defected from the army to join the rising M23 rebellion. The M23 had become increasingly active in DR Congo's east, stating that they were fighting to protect Tutsi rights, and that the government had failed to honour a peace deal signed in 2009. Makenga was elevated to the rank of an M23 general, then soon after, the top position. In November 2012 he led the rebels in a brutal uprising, in which they captured the city of Goma, a major eastern city with a population of more than a million. DR Congo and the UN accused Rwanda's Tutsi-dominated government of backing the M23 - an allegation which Kigali has persistently denied. But recently, the official response has shifted, with government spokespeople stating that fighting near its border is a security threat. By 2012, Makenga and others in the M23 were facing serious war crimes allegations. The US imposed sanctions on him, saying he was responsible for ""the recruitment of child soldiers, and campaigns of violence against civilians"". Makenga said allegations that the M23 used child soldiers were ""baseless"". Elsewhere, the UN said he had committed, and was responsible for, acts such as killing and maiming, sexual violence and abduction. Along with asset freezes, Makenga was facing a bitter split within the M23. One side backed him as leader while the other backed his rival, Gen Bosco Ntaganda. The Enough Project, a non-profit group working in DR Congo, said the two factions descended into a ""full-fledged war"" in 2013 and as a result, three soldiers and eight civilians died. Makenga's side triumphed and Gen Ntaganda fled to Rwanda, where he surrendered to the US embassy. Nicknamed the ""Terminator"" for his ruthlessness, Gen Ntaganda was eventually sentenced by the International Criminal Court (ICC) to 30 years for war crimes. However, months after Makenga's triumph, another, larger threat appeared. The UN had deployed a 3,000-strong force with a mandate to support the Congolese military in reclaiming Goma, prompting the M23 to withdraw. The rebel group was expelled from the country and Makenga fled to Uganda, a country which has also been accused of supporting the M23 - an allegation it denies. Uganda received an extradition request for Makenga from DR Congo, but did not act on it. Eight years passed. Dozens of other armed groups roamed the mineral-rich east, wreaking havoc, but the Congolese authorities were free of the most notorious militants. That is, until 2021. Makenga and his rebels took up arms again, capturing territory in North Kivu province. Several ceasefires between the M23 and the Congolese authorities have failed, and last year a judge sentencing Makenga to death in absentia. During the M23's latest advance, in which the rebels are said to be supported by thousands of Rwandan troops, Makenga has barely been seen in public. He instead leaves the public speeches and statements to his spokesperson, and Corneille Nangaa, who heads an alliance of rebel groups including the M23. But Makenga remains a key player, appearing to focus on strategy behind the scenes. He has said his relentless fighting has been for his three children, ""so that one day they will have a better future in this country"". ""I shouldn't be seen as a man who doesn't want peace. I have a heart, a family, and people I care about,"" he said. But millions of ordinary people are paying the price of this conflict and if he is captured by the Congolese forces, Makenga faces the death penalty. Yet he is undeterred. ""I am willing to sacrifice everything, "" he said. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

Nujoma led the long fight for independence from South Africa in 1990 after helping found Namibia's liberation movement known as the South West Africa People's Organisation (Swapo) in the 1960s. After independence, Nujoma became president in 1990 and led the country until 2005. Nujoma had been hospitalised over the past three weeks with an illness from which he ""could not recover"", Namibian President Nangolo Mbumba said in a statement announcing the death with ""utmost sorrow and sadness"". He ""inspired us to rise to our feet and to become masters of this vast land of our ancestors,"" President Mbumba said. He added: ""Our founding father lived a long and consequential life during which he exceptionally served the people of his beloved country."" King Charles III said he and Queen Camilla had been ""profoundly saddened"" to learn of Nujoma's death. In a statement released by Buckingham Palace, the King paid tribute to Nujoma's ""lifelong commitment to freedom and democracy"" and ""immense"" contribution to history. Nujoma retired as head of state in 2005, but continued to lead the party before stepping down in 2007 as president of the ruling Swapo party after 47 years at the helm. Many Namibians have reacted to his death with sadness, fondly remembering him as ""father of the nation"", says the BBC's Frauke Jensen in Namibia's capital, Windhoek. A teary-eyed Mbumba visited Nujoma's home to offer condolences to his family, including his wife Kovambo Theopoldine Katjimune, 91. Nujoma is widely credited for ensuring peace and stability after independence from South Africa, which was then under white-minority rule, in 1990. Nujoma's policy of national reconciliation encouraged the country's white community to remain, and they still play a major role in farming and other sectors of the economy. He also championed the rights of women and children, including making fathers pay for the maintenance of children born out of wedlock. Namibia's Vice-President Netumbo Nandi-Ndaitwah, who is due to be inaugurated as president in March after leading Swapo to victory in elections, said his ""visionary leadership and dedication to liberation and nation-building laid the foundation for our free, united nation"". African leaders have joined in paying tribute, with African Union Commission chairman Moussa Faki Mahamat describing Nujoma as ""the epitome of courage, never wavering from his vision for a free Namibia and a unified Africa"". South Africa's President Cyril Ramaphosa said the former Namibian president was an ""extraordinary freedom fighter"" who played a leading role in not only his country's fight against colonialism, but also in the campaign that led to white-minority rule ending in South Africa in 1994. ""President Nujoma's leadership of a free Namibia laid the foundation for the solidarity and partnership our two countries share today - a partnership we will continue to deepen as neighbours and friends,"" Ramaphosa added. Kenya's President William Ruto said Nujoma was a ""visionary leader who dedicated his life to the liberation and development of his country"". Funeral details have not yet been announced."

The grave was discovered north of Kufra, just days after another mass grave with 19 bodies was found on a farm in the same city. Officials found the latest grave following a raid on a human trafficking site, where authorities freed 76 migrants who had been detained and tortured, the office of the attorney general posted on Facebook. One Libyan and two foreigners have been arrested, it added. ""There was a gang whose members deliberately deprived illegal migrants of their freedom, tortured them and subjected them to cruel, humiliating and inhumane treatment,"" the statement said. Images shared online - which the BBC has not independently verified - show police and volunteers digging in the sand before placing corpses in black bags. The search in Kufra - more than 1,700 kilometres (1,056 miles) from Libya's capital Tripoli - is continuing. The attorney general says the bodies recovered have been taken for autopsy, with investigators suspecting links to smuggling networks. Authorities are documenting the testimonies of survivors. Last year, a mass grave containing the bodies of at least 65 migrants was found in the south-west of Libya. The International Organization for Migration (IOM) described it as ""deeply shocking"" at the time. Since the overthrow of Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011, the country has become a key transit route for migrants risking dangerous desert and Mediterranean Sea crossings to reach Europe. Unicef has said that in 2024 the number of people who died or went missing in the Mediterranean, trying to reach Europe, surpassed 2,200."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gx0jw5v1lo,How Somalis see the 'Black Hawk Down' battle three decades on,2025-02-09T12:41:41.783Z,Abdishukri Haybe,"The expression Black Hawk Down, the title of a Hollywood film, has become shorthand for a 1993 US military disaster in Somalia. Eighteen American soldiers lost their lives in the fighting that began on 3 October, but so did hundreds of Somalis. As Netflix launches a documentary about those events, the BBC has spoken to some Somalis still scarred by what happened. Despite being surrounded by the debris of an ongoing civil war, Mogadishu's residents in the early 1990s embraced the moments of serenity. The warm Sunday sunshine and cooling ocean breeze made for the perfect opportunity for Binti Ali Wardhere, 24 at the time, to visit relatives with her mother. ""That day was calm,"" she remembers. But like everyone else in the city she was unaware that the Americans were getting ready to attack warlord Mohamed Farah Aideed – and what happened would change her life forever. The US had deployed soldiers to Somalia in 1992. They were there to support a UN mission that offered humanitarian assistance to alleviate a famine – in part caused by the collapse of the central government. But after Aideed was blamed for being behind the killing of 24 UN peacekeepers in June 1993, he became a focus of military action. This included a US raid in July in which at least 70 Somalis died, marking a turning-point in the way the Americans were viewed. It also led to the deployment of elite US Rangers. On 3 October, the US got intelligence that Aideed would be at a meeting with his top officials at a hotel. The Americans launched an airborne operation that was supposed to take 90 minutes – in the end it lasted 17 hours. For Binti, the first sign that something unusual was happening was the sound of deafening explosions that started just after 15:30 local time. Mogadishu residents had become accustomed to the sound of fighting, but there was something about the magnitude of these blasts and the shockwaves they caused that felt abnormal. People began fleeing in all directions. Determined to understand what was happening, Binti climbed to the rooftop of her relative's house. From there, she saw that the fighting was taking place in her own neighbourhood. Two US Black Hawk helicopters were shot down, one at 16:20 and the other at 16:40. The taskforce was surrounded and then a rescue mission began. Fearing for her family, Binti ran for home. ""To this day, I still see the bodies scattered in the streets,"" she says. Binti reached her house just after 18:00 and was relieved to find everyone safe. The fighting eased a little bit, bringing a brief moment of calm. She served tea as her husband discussed the war with a neighbour. But he did not have a chance to taste the tea as a shell hit their house. Binti felt her hand get partially severed. She fell to the ground, a woman collapsed on top of her. ""There was hot water running over my head. I thought to myself: 'Who opened the water pipe?'"" She then realised it was the blood of the person on top of her, who had died. It was Binti's neighbour who had come to their house for safety. That night, Binti also lost her husband, Mohamed Aden, and two sons - 14-year-old Abdulkadir Mohamed and 13-year-old Abdurahman Mohamed. Four of her other children, along with her brother, who had been staying with them, were injured. Her brother later succumbed to his injuries. Ifrah, who was just four years old at the time, was permanently blinded. Binti's eldest son, now a father himself, continues to struggle with mental health issues. To this day, the sight or sound of an aeroplane sends him into hiding. He did not know it on that quiet Sunday morning, but prominent cameraman Ahmed Mohamed Hassan, also known as Ahmed Five, was to play a major role in how the events were seen. Twenty-nine at the time, he had already documented clan wars, famine and the chaotic events of Mogadishu and its suburbs. That day, he was not thinking about work when the explosions rattled the air. The sounds of helicopter gunfire and heavy machine guns signalled something more intense than the crackle of AK-47 that he normally heard. Ahmed always carried his camera, knowing that in Mogadishu anything could happen at any moment. He instinctively began documenting the unfolding chaos and headed towards the heart of the battle. ""Although this situation was completely different from the ones I had worked in before, I still decided to record these events and take on that responsibility,"" he tells the BBC. The closest event he had ever witnessed to this was the July raid which galvanised anti-American sentiment and set the stage for October's confrontation. On the first day, he filmed some of the fighting between the US soldiers and the Somalis. Then on the second day, he was led to a house where US pilot Michael Durant was being held. Mr Durant had been flying the second Black Hawk that had come down after it was hit by a rocket-propelled grenade. After crashing, his three crew members were killed in the fighting along with two others who had gone to rescue them. ""It was a huge gun battle. They say that 25 Somalis were killed by gunfire at crash site two, so that gives you some insight into how much shooting was going on,"" Mr Durant later told the BBC. He was saved when a gunman recognised that the pilot might have value as a prisoner. Ahmed then filmed the nervous and battered American who had several scars on his face. He can be seen confirming his identity while breathing heavily and glancing to his side at an interrogator, who is out of shot. Until that point, neither the US nor Aideed knew Mr Durant was being held, Ahmed says. ""I handed the videotapes to a UN plane that flew daily from Mogadishu to Nairobi [in neighbouring Kenya]. ""The first report of the Mogadishu battle to reach the world was from the footage I recorded. At the time, I was working as a freelancer for CNN."" The images captured by Ahmed made headlines around the world. They also fed into the debate about US combat policy in the African continent, which shifted after the fighting in Mogadishu. ""This is something I take pride in - though at the time, I didn't anticipate its impact,"" Ahmed says. Within six months, the US had withdrawn its forces from Somalia. The perceived failure of the Somali mission made the US wary of intervening in subsequent African crises. The third of October started as a day of celebration in Saida Omar Mohamud's household as that morning she gave birth to a baby girl. Relatives and neighbours gathered at her home to congratulate her, as the family prepared for a traditional name-giving ceremony. But the mood shifted once the fighting started. Chaos erupted as the first helicopter crashed in front of Saida's home. Within moments, she remembers at least 10 US soldiers storming into the house. They gathered everyone into the living room, ordering them not to move and turned it into an impromptu field hospital. The family watched in shock as wounded soldiers were laid on their dining table, receiving emergency medical treatment. ""Although they were afraid, they made us scared as well. They turned our house into a stronghold,"" Saida says. As well as her own searing memories, Saida left a permanent reminder of that day with what she decided to call her daughter, As Somalis say, ""no name is given without a reason"" and so Saida's little girl is now known as Amina Rangers. The Netflix documentary features ""raw, immersive storytelling with first-person interviews from both sides of the Battle of Mogadishu"", according to the publicity. It sheds light on the horrors experienced by Somalis like Binti during the conflict. ""This time, Somalis were given the opportunity to share their account of events. It is crucial that both sides of the story are always told,"" Ahmed Five says. But for Binti Ali, simply telling the story is not enough. She lost loved ones in the war. Yet she feels the devastation inflicted on Somali families like hers remains largely unacknowledged. ""It was the Americans who destroyed my house, killed my husband, my two sons, and my brother, and left my family in lasting misery,"" she says, her voice breaking. ""At the very least, they must admit what they have done and compensate us."" Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn5rrp104d1o,Sam Nujoma: The revolutionary leader who liberated Namibia,2025-02-09T04:44:41.003Z,Wycliffe Muia in Nairobi & Frauke Jensen in Windhoek,"Revered as ""father of the nation"" and the icon of Namibia's liberation struggle, Sam Nujoma lived up to these expectations in more ways than one. His warm, broad smile and easy-going manner made him likeable and accessible. Whether donning a tracksuit to join a fun-run along Windhoek's Independence Avenue, or insisting his driver hang back from official motorcades, he aimed to be a man of the people. Now, four decades after leading Namibia through a bitter guerrilla war against South Africa's racist apartheid government and on to independence, Nujoma has died aged 95. He died on Saturday after being in hospital for three weeks due to ""ill health"", President Nangolo Mbumba announced in a statement, adding that the death had ""shaken"" the country. The giant who shaped Namibia's national identity leaves a void few can hope to fill. Namibia, previously called South West Africa, suffered decades of looting and colonial violence at the hands of Europeans who had flocked to the country around the turn of the 20th Century. Starting in 1904, German colonisers killed tens of thousands of Namibians in what has been dubbed the world's ""forgotten genocide"". German officers used black Africans as guinea pigs for horrific crimes later repeated by the Nazis during the Holocaust. Namibia was under German occupation from 1884 until 1915, when Germany lost its colony in World War One. Namibia then fell under the rule of white South Africa, which extended its racist laws to the country, denying black Namibians any political rights, as well as restricting social and economic freedoms. The introduction of sweeping apartheid legislation led to a guerrilla war of independence breaking out in 1966. By this stage, Nujoma was already involved in the fight against white-minority rule. The self-confessed ""elder son of a peasant family"" from the northern village of Etunda had a modest start in life, with little more than a primary school education. Married to Kovambo Theopoldine Katjimune with whom he had four children, and working on a railway, he held a deep passion for politics and yearned to see his people free from the injustice and indignity of colonialism. Inspiration came in the stories of early Namibian resistance leaders, such as Hendrik Witbooi, who fought against the Germans in the 1880s. By 1959, Nujoma had become the head of the Owamboland Peoples organisation, the independence movement that was a forerunner to Swapo. A year later, aged 30, Nujoma was forced into exile. With no passport, he used his cunning to adopt different personas and blagged his way onto trains and planes - ending up in Zambia and Tanzania before heading to West Africa. With the help of Liberian authorities who were early backers of black Namibians' push for independence, Nujoma flew to New York and petitioned the UN to help grant Namibia its independence - but South Africa refused. Nujoma was branded a ""Marxist terrorist"" by South Africa's white leaders for leading forces that fought alongside the anti-apartheid movement, posing a formidable challenge to the oppressive regimes in several southern African countries. With support from Cuban troops who were fighting in neighbouring Angola, Swapo guerrillas were able to attack South African bases in Namibia. Returning from exile, Nujoma was swiftly rearrested by the South African authorities and deported to Zambia six years later. ""We knew that only military force and mass political mobilisation backed by the support of the people would force South Africa out of Namibia,"" Nujoma narrated in his autobiography Where Others Wavered, which was published in 2001. He led Swapo forces from exile, before returning to the country in 1989, a year after South Africa had agreed to Namibian independence. South Africa was becoming more isolated internationally and the cost of military intervention was increasing. Namibia finally gained independence in 1990 after almost 25 years of warfare. In Namibia's first democratic elections in 1990, Swapo won a huge majority and Nujoma became the country's first president. Nujoma was especially concerned with the plight of children, introducing maintenance payments obliging absent fathers to contribute to the cost of raising their offspring. He also championed the advancement of women, helping to change traditional patriarchal practices that forced widows out of the family home once their husband died. He also appeared keen to preserve stability to ensure development efforts were supported by international donors. Nujoma was re-elected for two more terms in 1994 and 1999 - when he was criticised for having the constitution changed so that he could stand for a third term in office. When criticised for his style of government or questioned about his party's political past, the wide smile could turn sour. Pointing a finger at whoever dared openly question or criticise, he would sometimes lose his countenance and hurl insults. He openly abhorred same-sex relationships, but never went as far as changing the constitution or the law to make them illegal. Nujoma always valued his close friendship with Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, yet as Namibia's president he mostly steered clear of open aggression against those who did not agree with him. However through the Swapo machinery, he would quite happily exert pressure on the common man to tow the party line and allow the party to delve into government coffers to ensure continued rule. Nujoma's cabinet was often dictated to rather than reaching decisions by joint debate, such was his power. When he stepped down as president in 2005 and as Swapo president in 2007 after serving as the party leader for 47 years – he handed power to his successor, Hifikepunye Pohamba. Even after leaving office, Nujoma still wielded considerable power over the party and government from behind the scenes. Yet his achievements while in office are undeniable, with many Namibians praising him for leading the country's smooth transition to democratic rule. Since independence, Namibia has been seen as one of Africa's success stories, with regular peaceful and democratic elections. And, despite the humiliations and injustices heaped upon black Namibians by white colonisers, Nujoma upheld the country's constitution in safeguarding the basic rights of all Namibians whatever their ethnicity. The policy of national reconciliation encouraged the country's white community to remain, and they still play a major role in farming and other economic sectors. Nujoma's ability to unify a nation of three million people – across 10 ethnic and linguistic communities – won him many admirers. In recognition of his towering achievement, the Namibian parliament granted him the official status of ""Founding Father of Namibia"" in 2005. Numerous international honours included the Lenin Peace Prize, the Indira Gandhi Peace Prize and the Ho Chi Minh Peace Prize. In his latter years, Nujoma disappeared from the limelight, preferring instead to spend time with his large family. He is remembered for his easy charm and unwavering conviction - father not just to a family but a whole nation.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cew5q04q427o,African summit urges immediate DR Congo ceasefire,2025-02-08T20:20:12.832Z,Sammy Awami Jaroslav Lukiv,"Leaders from east and southern Africa have called for an immediate and unconditional ceasefire to end the deadly fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo. At a crisis summit in Tanzania, the Southern African Development Community and East African Community (EAC) blocs urged all warring parties to hold peace talks within five days, including with the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels. The rebels - fighting government forces - have seized vast swathes of land in the eastern DR Congo, including the city of Goma. Their push towards Bukavu has raised fears of a wider regional war. As part of their talks, army chiefs have also been told to draw up a security plan for Goma and surrounding areas. The latest UN figures suggest 2,900 people have been killed since early January, as a result of the hostilities between M23 and armed forces of the DR Congo. Around 700,000 are estimated to have been displaced and thousands more injured. Saturday's gathering in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's biggest city, brought together heads of state and government representatives to try to resolve the worsening security and humanitarian situation. ""The summit emphasises that political and diplomatic engagement is the most sustainable solution to the conflict,"" said the follow-up communique. It also demanded the reopening of Goma airport and other key routes to facilitate humanitarian aid, as well as the withdrawal of uninvited foreign armed forces from Congolese territory. M23, which is made up of ethnic Tutsis, say they are fighting for minority rights while DR Congo's government says the Rwanda-backed rebels are seeking control of the eastern region's vast mineral wealth. Rwandan President Paul Kagame - who was at the summit - has repeatedly denied any involvement in supporting the rebels. But, as reported last month by the BBC's Ian Wafula, a group of UN experts maintains the Rwandan army is in ""de facto control of M23 operations"" - detailing how M23 recruits are trained under Rwandan supervision and supported by high-tech Rwandan weaponry. Following the summit, Kagame posted on Facebook, accusing the DR Congo of ""mounting a security problem against our country"". The DR Congo's President, Félix Tshisekedi, opted to appear at the summit via video link. Prime Minister Judith Suminwa was there in person. There was no immediate response from Suminwa or the Congolese delegation to the joint communique. Kenyan President William Ruto, the current EAC chairperson, stressed military solutions alone could not resolve the crisis. ""We must resist the temptation to think that we can somehow shoot or bombard our way into a solution in the face of such a complex situation,"" he said. Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan underscored a ""collective responsibility"" of regional leaders to end the conflict, saying ""history will judge us harshly if we remain still and watch the situation worsen day by day"". The ongoing conflict dates back to the 1990s, but has rapidly escalated in recent weeks. The DR Congo is so vast - two-thirds the size of Western Europe - that it is a member of both the East and Southern African blocs."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp8qp6p39e9o,Who's pulling the strings in the DR Congo crisis?,2025-02-08T02:01:54.106Z,Barbara Plett Usher,"The seizure by M23 rebels of vast tracts of land in the mineral-rich east of the Democratic Republic of Congo has triggered a humanitarian and diplomatic crisis, involving several neighbouring countries. An alarming number of African armies already have troops deployed in the conflict zone, which has a long history of outside interference. The DR Congo is so vast - two-thirds the size of Western Europe - that it is a member of both the East and Southern African blocs. The two regional groupings are joining forces to hold an emergency summit on Saturday to try and end the fighting. So, who are the main players and what do they want? First and foremost is the Congolese President Félix Tshisekedi. He wants to regain territory lost to the rebels, including the largest eastern town of Goma, and to prevent them from seizing more. He blames Rwandan leader Paul Kagame for backing the M23 with weapons and troops, accusing Kigali of invading Congolese territory with the aim of looting the country's mineral wealth and orchestrating regime change. The case that Rwanda is supporting the M23 offensive is based on evidence presented in a UN report and broadly accepted by many African and Western governments, who have demanded that Kagame withdraw his forces. However, to Tshisikedi's frustration, none have matched their rhetoric with action and responded to Kinshasa's calls for sanctions and other tough measures. The Congolese leader is also worried about keeping his seat. ""I think the political survival of his government is at stake,"" said Jason Stearns, a former UN investigator in DR Congo and currently a professor at Simon Fraser University. There is concern that the M23 campaign might embolden internal opposition forces or trigger a coup in his army, which has a reputation for being fragmented and undermined by corruption. In this conflict, Rwanda's long-time leader Kagame is the centre of attention, but he's practised at deflecting it. He has a long history of military intervention inside DR Congo linked to the aftermath of the 1994 Rwanda genocide. Rwanda does not admit to providing military support to the M23, but repeatedly insists it will do anything necessary to defend itself. Kagame maintains that Rwanda's priority is to destroy an armed group formed by the Hutu genocide perpetrators, who massacred Rwandan Tutsis and then fled to what is now eastern DR Congo. He has accused DR Congo's army of joining forces with them and others to not only slaughter Congolese Tutsis - who the M23 claims to be fighting to protect - but to threaten Rwanda. At a diplomatic level, Rwanda wants confirmation of its narrative – that the conflict is a Congolese problem, and Kigali is simply defending its borders against the spill-over of a civil war. It's demanding that Kinshasa negotiate directly with the M23, which it refuses to do. But what it's really after, said Mr Stearns, is ""to maintain a sphere of influence in the eastern DR Congo"". Rwanda has economic as well as security interests. Kigali denies UN evidence that it smuggles vast amounts of gold and other metals out of eastern DR Congo and sells them as its own. But access to DR Congo's mineral wealth has been a driver of conflict in the region for decades. There are others this time around, not least the personal animosity between Kagame and Tshisekedi. ""Kagame wants to teach Tshisekedi a lesson about who's the strong guy on the block,"" said Richard Moncrieff, who monitors Africa's Great Lakes region for the International Crisis Group (ICG). The Rwandans are ""just going to keep fighting until he makes concessions and…gives them fairly free rein in [the eastern province of] North Kivu,"" he added. Rwanda sees Burundi's army as another security threat in eastern DR Congo. The nation that borders both Rwanda and DR Congo has had thousands of soldiers there for years. They went to hunt down Burundian rebels but are now supporting Kinshasa's army in battles against the M23. Relations between Rwanda and Burundi are hostile. The two countries have a similar ethnic make-up but unlike Rwanda, the majority Hutus are in power in Burundi. Both countries have accused each other of trying to overthrow their respective governments. Burundi's President Evariste Ndayishimiye has posted a strongly-worded warning on social media. ""If Rwanda continues to make conquests,"" he wrote, ""I know that war will even arrive in Burundi… One day he [Kagame] wants to come to Burundi - we're not going to accept that. The war will spread."" The threat would increase if the M23 continues its advance from Goma into the province of South Kivu closer to Burundi's border, which is where its forces are stationed. ""What Burundi is seeking here is regime survival,"" said Mr Stearns. ""Burundi is worried that if Rwandan troops… extend their influence into South Kivu that could destabilize the government in Bujumbura. What's at stake here is stopping this rebellion before it gets too close to home."" Some fear a repeat of the two wars that engulfed the region in the late 1990s, which drew in nine different countries and reportedly led to millions of deaths. This time, direct clashes between the two armies could extend the DR Congo's conflict beyond its borders. Uganda is not directly involved, but it also has troops in eastern DR Congo. They are helping the Congolese government with a different security threat – hunting down militants with Ugandan origins who are connected to the Islamic State group. But Uganda's role is confusing – it's working with the Congolese, while also allegedly providing at least complicit support to the M23. UN experts report that it has allowed them to use Ugandan territory as a rear base and supply route. Kampala strongly denies that. But it has responded to the M23 offensive by putting its troops in a ""forward defensive posture,"" to prevent other armed groups from exploiting the crisis, it has said. Local residents have reported seeing Ugandan soldiers moving towards the conflict zone, heightening fears of a regional escalation. Like Rwanda, Uganda has entered eastern DR Congo in the past claiming to be protecting its borders. But it's also accused of looting natural resources, especially gold. Analysts expect it to safeguard its economic interests while keeping an eye on the Rwandans. ""It's very clear that Uganda wants to retain its own influence in eastern DR Congo and not be pushed out by its rival in Rwanda,"" says the ICG's Mr Moncrieff. South Africa has contributed most of the troops to a Southern African regional force fighting alongside the Congolese army and has suffered heavy losses. But it's also been thrust into the headlines because of an astonishingly vitriolic exchange between Kigali and Johannesburg. The South Africans blamed the deaths of 14 of their soldiers on the Rwandan Defense Forces, which President Cyril Ramaphosa disparagingly referred to as the ""RDF militia."" His defence minister claimed he'd warned Kagame that any further shooting would be taken as a declaration of war. This infuriated the Rwandan president, who said that the account of their conversation was a ""lie"" and called the South Africans a ""belligerent"" force that must leave the DR Congo. This is the sharpest end of a broad division between the East African Community (EAC) and the Southern African Development Community (Sadc). The EAC supports Rwanda's call for direct talks between Kinshasa and the M23. While Sadc condemns RDF attacks on its soldiers, including Tanzanian and Malawian troops, and has reaffirmed their commitment to DR Congo's independence, sovereignty, and territorial integrity.

""Shrapnel and stray ammunition are falling on my neighbourhood,"" a doctor we are calling Mustafa tells the BBC. ""The clashes these days are heavy"". Key sites recaptured by the army this week include the mint – where money is printed. At the time of writing, the RSF still controls most of Khartoum proper. Whereas the army now holds the majority of territory across the wider tripartite capital - meaning Omdurman, Bahri and Khartoum. But, after winning back near total control of the crucial state of Gezira, the army believes it now has the momentum to take the capital too, and break the RSF's almost two-year siege. ""Very soon there will be no rebels in Khartoum,"" announced army leader and de facto ruler Gen Abdel Fattah al-Burhan on Tuesday. An end to this conflict cannot come fast enough. Aid workers say people are starving across the country as a result of the war – in Khartoum alone more than 100,000 people are suffering from famine, according to UN-backed researchers. Since war broke out almost two years ago between Gen Burhan and his deputy-turned-rival Mohamed Hamdan ""Hemedti"" Dagalo who leads the RSF, 12 million people have been forced from their homes and tens of thousands of civilians have been butchered. Sudan is the world's worst humanitarian crisis, agree international aid agencies. They say both the army and the RSF are guilty of committing some of the gravest atrocities imaginable against innocent civilians, including that the RSF has carried out a genocide in Darfur. Both forces deny the accusations. The army has been jubilantly welcomed by many inhabitants of the areas it has recently recaptured, as the RSF has been widely accused of killing and raping civilians in Khartoum, as well as looting the homes of the many residents who have fled the city. Reports of the army's advance have been dismissed by the RSF as ""lies and rumours"". They have made similar denials ahead of every retreat in recent weeks. Analysts say the army's recent successes have been the result of enlisting more fighters and buying more weaponry. Winning back the besieged army headquarters was also a huge boon earlier this month. The army's expulsion of the paramilitary group from the central city of Wad Madani in January was marred by allegations of summary executions and arbitrary retribution attacks on those perceived to be RSF informants or collaborators. This will no doubt raise fears among some Khartoum residents that the same fate awaits them. ""When you open social media and you see all the killing, if you've committed something wrong you must be worried,"" Mustafa told the BBC. ""Some of them led fighters to people's homes. Others joined [the RSF] and stole property, terrorised people - even held women against their will [as sex slaves]. They did horrible things. ""Are they terrified of what is to come? Of course."" But sometimes there is a fine line between being seen as a collaborator, and the reality of survival in war. ""I am worried for my cousin,"" says Amir, who lives in Khartoum's twin city of Omdurman, which lies just across the River Nile. ""He is not a collaborator or an informant - he often has to deal with these people [the RSF] because he's looking after his mother and his kids. Will he be slaughtered [by the army] or will he be left alone?"" For now, as the army approaches and Sudan's future hands in the balance, all that Mustafa and Amir can do is wait.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn8xpry2kreo,Stylish earrings to gold shoes on show at South Africa's biggest political event,2025-02-07T12:14:48.145Z,Danai Nesta Kupemba,"Politicians, musicians, and celebrities arrived in their most glamorous looks for one of South Africa's biggest political events - the State of the Nation Address (Sona), making it almost as much about fashion as politics. Sona is a joint sitting of the two houses of parliament in Cape Town to mark the start of the government's work for the year, where President Cyril Ramaphosa paints a picture of where the country stands and outlines the road ahead. In his speech, President Ramaphosa talked about the nation's resilience, earning rapturous applause when he declared, ""South Africa will not be bullied."" His stance comes after his US counterpart Donald Trump threatened to cut funding over South Africa's land policy. While governance takes centre stage, Sona has evolved into a fashion spectacle over the years, with MPs using their outfits to support local designers and showcase South African talent. The outfits are always a hot topic on social media, and this year is no exception. Praise singer Inako Mateza, this year's imbongi (traditional praise poet), played a key role in one of the most significant Sona traditions. Through song and dance, she recounted President Cyril Ramaphosa's life story and history, blending tradition with a personal touch. She ended her performance by addressing the president with his well-known nickname, ""Cupcake."" South Africa Minister of Water and Sanitation, Pemmy Majodina wore a traditional outfit and spectacular earrings. Her Xhosa-inspired outfit was made by self-taught seamstress, Zoleka Vicky Magwaca, from the Mthatha Art Centre in Eastern Cape ""I am committed to supporting local designers,"" Majodina told Eye Witness News on the red carpet. Water was a key part of Ramaphosa's speech, as he said there would be investment in several water projects to address the shortages affecting the whole country. Draped in gold, this snazzy dresser is legendary Kwaito singer, Gezani Kobane, also known as Papa Penny. He is a member of former President Jacob Zuma's party, uMkhonto we Sizwe (MK). As MK cements its presence in South African politics as the main opposition party, figures like Kobane are drawing attention both for their political stance and their distinctive style. But Zuma wasn't in attendance, as he was dealing with his ongoing trial on allegations of corruption over an arms deal. He denies any wrongdoing. Outside parliament, there is a red carpet for guests and ministers to strike a pose. This year's Sona was held at Cape Town City Hall as the parliament building is still being rebuilt after a fire ripped through the building in 2022. Sports Minister Gayton Mckenzie looked dapper in an all-black ensemble with matching sunglasses. South African politician and Pondo traditional leader Mwelo Nonkonyana, who now serves on the Congress of Traditional Leaders of South Africa in the Eastern Cape made sure his heritage was on full display. The traditional beaded staff is a symbol of wisdom and authority, making it the perfect finishing touch for Sona. Julius Malema's party, the Economic Freedom Fighters (EFF) arrived in their trademark red overalls. The party has disrupted previous Sonas, but this year they were relatively calm. Malema expressed his disappointment in President Ramaphosa speech and told local broadcaster eNCA, it was just ""waffle"". Lindiwe Ntshalintshali, the Deputy Minister of Correctional Services, was dressed to the nines as she dazzled in a gold-beaded dress while listening to the speech.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy081kq89yko,Johannesburg revival: Bringing hope to one of world's most dangerous cities,2025-02-06T14:33:21.677Z,Ed Habershon,"The view is spectacular from the top of Ponte Tower, one of the most famous buildings in the South African city of Johannesburg. Built in 1975, standing almost 200m (656 ft) tall, it's a long-established feature of the city skyline, once the tallest residential building in Africa. But like the city, it's had its ups and downs. In the 1980s it was taken over by criminal gangs, and its hollow core filled with rubbish up to 50m deep. ""The building got hijacked. There were no utilities, so most of the people were actually throwing their trash right inside the building, until it reached the 14th floor,"" said Delight Sithole, who runs tours of the building. He added: ""There were some dead bodies here, illegal firearms, drugs. The smell, I'm sure it was just horrible, just really like, hell on earth. ""If you asked anybody what happens in that round building, somebody would have something interesting or scary to say about it,"" said Sifiso Zikhali, who works with Mr Sithole in an organisation called Dlala Nje, which means ""just play"" in Zulu. ""People were scared of the neighbourhood,"" he said. Johannesburg was seen as being one of the most dangerous cities in the world. But the building turned itself around 15 years ago in the wake of the Fifa World Cup hosted in South Africa, and people started moving back in. After Covid, people returned and the building is now around three-quarters full. There is no escaping the issues that Johannesburg, and South Africa, face. Despite signs of improvement in the most recent statistics, crime is still a major issue. Crippling power cuts that plagued the city for years, known as load-shedding, came to an end almost a year ago, but now a water crisis is looming, leaving many without. A building fire in the Central Business District (CBD) killed almost 80 people in the winter of 2023, and exposed the issue of hijacked buildings, disused housing and apartments blocks that have been taken over by criminal gangs who charge people to live there. This is an area that's been regenerated by a property company called Ithemba, which is Zulu for ""hope"". And it's a company that is seeing business booming in Johannesburg. A few days later, on a tour of one of Ithemba's flagship residential developments called Jewel City, senior manager Alan Tait explains the turnaround. ""The demand is just phenomenal, and that demand is specifically to live in the CBD,"" he said. He said that the company currently leases 7,200 properties and is expected to double that over the next two years. Named after its origins as a diamond dealing district, like the Ponte building the area fell into disrepair, only to see a resurgence. ""We launched Jewel City about five years ago, just as Covid was hitting. So the timing was a little bit out. But as soon as Covid lifted, the buildings filled up quite quickly,"" he said. As we near the edge of the development, he points out a long strip of lights under a flyover. They were put up to provide light in an area that had been dark for some time, largely due to the loadshedding affected the city. It was part of an initiative by a group called JoziMyJozi which started in 2023. One of its first projects was to light up the Nelson Mandela bridge, a centrepiece of the city, that meant people once again found it safe to use. ""So the whole aim of JoziMyJozi is to bring hope back to the residents of the city,"" said Bea Swanepoel, CEO of the organisation, in the courtyard behind her office in Rosebank, north of the city centre. ""And by bringing hope back, we need to show some visible improvements and impactful projects so that they can see there's a way out of where we are currently, and to live in the city of the future, where people can be safe and where they can thrive and where there are jobs."" The group also launched the gateway project, an effort to clean up the ten main entrances to the city, and they've begun to tackle everything from potholes, to homelessness to education. Could Johannesburg one day be spoken about like London, Paris or New York? ""Well, that is the intention,"" said Ms Swanepoel. ""Much of what's happening in Joburg is due to perceptions. We have a long way to go. I mean, there's no doubt about that, but it's not impossible. We need to get up there and be the gold standard for cities in Africa."" The city is due to host the G20 later this year, which will bring new investment and attention to the city. Back on 51st floor of the Ponte tower, Sifiso Zikhali gazes out of the window. Does he think Dlala Nje is succeeding in its mission? ""Yes we are, because one of our biggest challenges was to get people coming here. We are now one of the city's top attractions. This is our city, and whatever we face, we need at the end to find a solution for it,"" he said. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m1jmdr4jgo,Malawi president orders troops to withdraw from DR Congo,2025-02-06T12:51:14.573Z,Paul Njie in Rusizi & Basillioh Rukanga in Nairobi,"Malawi's President Lazarus Chakwera has ordered the military to begin preparing to withdraw from their peacekeeping mission in the volatile eastern Democratic of Congo. The Malawian troops are part of the southern African regional bloc's military mission (SAMIDRC) deployed to DR Congo to help tackle armed groups. At least 20 peacekeepers, including 14 South Africans and three Malawians, were killed as the M23 rebels captured the key city of Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, last week. President Chakwera said on Wednesday that his decision was meant to ""honour the declaration of a ceasefire by the parties"", even though the fighting is continuing. In a statement read on state TV on Wednesday evening, he said the withdrawal of troops would ""pave the way for their planned negotiations towards a lasting peace"". Malawi Information Minister Moses Kunkuyu told the BBC Newsday programme that the planned withdrawal was being ""made in good faith"". He said a meeting by southern African leaders last week in Tanzania, on the sidelines of the Africa Energy Summit, had passed a resolution ""to call for a ceasefire from all parties in the conflict, just to pave way for peaceful negotiations"". ""It is pursuant to that agreement that the president of Malawi has seen it fit to contribute to the peace-building effort by withdrawing troops from the region so that there is that peaceful negotiation"". He did not indicate exactly when the troops would leave, but said what remained were the ""operational aspects"" and that they had communicated the decision to the DR Congo president and the southern Africa bloc. On Monday, the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group declared a unilateral ceasefire ""for humanitarian reasons"", which was due to start the following day. However, fighting has since resumed, and the rebels have reportedly taken the mining town of Nyabibwe in the South Kivu province. The Malawian president has been under pressure to withdraw his country's forces from DR Congo in the wake of the deaths of peacekeepers. South Africa has faced similar pressure, but President Cyril Ramaphosa has vowed to keep his troops in DR Congo, saying they are subject to the SAMIDRC mission ""which has operational timeframes and an end date"". The mission was initially deployed in 2023 and was last year extended until December this year. The SAMIDRC mission was authorised by the southern African bloc (Sadc) to have 5,000 troops from South Africa, Malawi and Tanzania. South Africa, which leads the mission, was to deploy 2,900 troops and the rest shared between Malawi and Tanzania - although it is not clear how many troops are currently there. Malawi also has some soldiers in DR Congo serving under the UN peacekeeping force Monusco. Sadc leaders are due to meet in Tanzania this Saturday in a special joint summit with East African heads of states to address the DR Congo crisis. Bitter rivals DR Congo President Félix Tshisekedi and Rwanda's President Paul Kagame are both expected to attend. Meanwhile, the Ugandan military has denied reports it has sent troops to eastern DR Congo because of the fighting in and around Goma. Since their capture of Goma, the rebels have been seeking to seize territories in South Kivu, especially the capital Bukavu. Congolese authorities have enlisted hundreds of civilian volunteers to help defend the city. The rebel group has appointed top officials including a governor of North Kivu, to administer the territory. For the first time since they seized Goma, the M23 on Thursday held a rally in the city that saw rebel leader Corneille Nangaa address large crowds at the Unity Stadium. A warrant for Nangaa's arrest has been issued by a military court in Kinshasa, accusing him of war crimes and treason. The UN says nearly 3,000 people were killed during the M23's violent campaign to seize Goma. There are fears that diseases such as Mpox and cholera could spread beyond the city. The International Criminal Court has said its prosecutors are closely following events in DR Congo ""including the grave escalation of violence over the past week"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn01k8948v1o,"Your phone, a rare metal and the war in DR Congo",2025-02-05T18:40:22.682Z,Damian Zane,"There is a good chance that inside your mobile phone is a miniscule amount of a metal that started its journey buried in the earth of eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, where a war is currently raging. It may even be directly connected to the M23 rebel group that made global headlines this week. The tantalum within your device weighs less than half of the average garden pea but is essential for the efficient functioning of a smartphone, and almost all other sophisticated electronic devices. The unique properties of this rare, blue-grey, lustrous metal – including being able to hold a high charge compared to its size, while operating in a range of temperatures - make it an ideal material for tiny capacitors, which temporarily store energy. It is also mined in Rwanda, Brazil and Nigeria but at least 40% - and maybe more – of the element's global supply comes from DR Congo and some of the key mining areas are now under the control of the M23. The current wave of fighting has been going on for months, but the rebels grabbed attention with Sunday's assault on the vital trading and transport hub of Goma. The city, bordering Rwanda, is a regional centre for the mining business Over the past year, the M23 has made rapid advances across the mineral-rich east of DR Congo, taking areas where coltan – the ore from which tantalum is extracted – is mined. Like scores of other armed groups operating in the area, the M23 began as an outfit defending the rights of an ethnic group perceived to be under threat. But as its territory has expanded, mining has become a crucial source of income, paying for fighters and weapons. Last April, it seized Rubaya, the town at the heart of the country's coltan industry. Mineral extraction in this region is not in the hands of multinational conglomerates - instead thousands of individuals toil in open pits that honeycomb the landscape, or underground, in extremely unsafe and unhealthy conditions. They are part of a complex, and yet informal, network that sees the rocks removed from the ground using shovels, brought to the surface, crushed, washed, taxed, sold and then exported to be further purified and eventually smelted. Once the M23 moved into Rubaya, the rebels established what a UN group of experts described as a ""state-like administration"", issuing permits to the diggers and traders and demanding an annual fee of $25 (£20) and $250 respectively. The M23 doubled the diggers' wages to ensure they would carry on working. It runs the area as a monopoly making sure – through the threat of arrest and detention – that only its authorised traders are able to do business. The M23 also charges a levy of $7 on each kilogramme of coltan. The UN group of experts estimated that as a result the M23 earns about $800,000 a month from coltan taxation in Rubaya. That money is almost certainly then used to fund the rebellion. There is a question mark hanging over how the ore extracted from M23-controlled areas gets into the global supply chain. Neighbouring Rwanda, which is seen as backing the M23, is at the centre of the answer, the UN experts say. Theoretically, a traceability system - known as the International Tin Supply Chain Initiative (Itsci) - should mean that what goes into a phone handset and other electronics is sourced responsibly and avoids conflict financing and human rights abuses. The US' Dodd-Frank Act passed in 2010, and a similar piece of EU legislation, is aimed at ensuring that companies purchasing tin, tantalum, tungsten and gold – so-called ""conflict minerals"" – are not inadvertently funding violence. But Itsci has come under some criticism. Ken Matthysen, a security and resource management expert with independent research group Ipis, highlights that the dispersed nature of a lot of small-scale mines make it difficult for the local authorities to monitor exactly what is going on everywhere. Itsci tags should be put on bags at the mine itself, to prove the origin of the minerals inside, but often they get transported to a collection point where it becomes harder to trace where the ore actually came from, Mr Matthysen said. He added that there is also a possible issue with corruption. ""There is even an accusation of the state agents selling tags to traders, because they don't make a good living. So the traders then go around eastern DR Congo and they tag the bags themselves."" In a statement to the BBC, Itsci said it covers 3,000 mine sites and that it works ""at any mine, regardless of their size or remoteness, following the goal of 'leaving no-one behind'... Excluding remote areas would be the opposite of responsible sourcing and would exacerbate potential risks."" Itsci added that these remote communities have benefitted from its support. The scheme has also been praised for bringing ""prosperity for hundreds of thousands of small-scale miners"". In the case of Rubaya, Itsci suspended its operations there soon after the M23 entered the town. Nevertheless, the group has managed to continue exporting coltan. The UN experts map a circuitous route showing how it is transported to close to the Rwandan border. It is then transferred to ""heavy-duty trucks"" that needed the road to be widened in order to accommodate them. Rwanda has its own coltan mines but the experts say that the uncertified coltan is mixed with Rwandan production leading to a ""significant contamination of supply chains"". The M23 was already involved in the coltan business before the capture of Rubaya - setting up roadblocks and charging fees to cross them, according to Mr Matthysen. ""A lot of the trade of these minerals went through M23-controlled area towards Rwanda. So even then, Rwanda was profiting from the instability in eastern DR Congo and we saw the export volumes to Rwanda were already increasing,"" he told the BBC. Figures from the US Geological Survey show that Rwanda's coltan exports rose by 50% between 2022 and 2023. Mr Matthysen said this could not have all come from Rwanda. In a robust defence of Rwanda's position, government spokesperson Yolande Makolo reiterated to the BBC that there were minerals and refining capacity in her own country. ""It's very cynical to take an issue like what's happening in eastern DRC, where a persecuted community is fighting for its rights... and turning [it] into an issue of material benefit,"" she added. Rwandan President Paul Kagame has also dismissed the UN experts' reports, pouring scorn on their ""expertise"". Much of the east of DR Congo has been blighted by conflict for many years, raising questions about who has been benefitting and whether armed groups are profiting from what is dug out of the ground there. In order to highlight the issue and its connection to the smartphone industry, the Congolese government filed criminal complaints in France and Belgium at the end of last year against subsidiaries of the tech giant Apple, accusing it of using ""conflict minerals"". Apple has disputed the allegation and pointed out that since early 2024, because of the escalating conflict and the difficulties of certification, it stopped sourcing tantalum, among other metals, from both DR Congo and Rwanda. Other companies have not been so clear, which means that as the M23 seizes more territory those small bits of tantalum from the mines that they control could still make their way into the devices that we have come to rely on.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly9j1peg2po,Era-defining Benin musician dies aged 39,2025-02-05T18:25:26.975Z,Rachida Houssou,"Tributes have been paid to Willy Mignon, an era-defining Beninese musician who died at the age of 39. The artist passed away hours after having a seizure, his sister Christel told the BBC, adding that she was not clear on the exact cause of death. Mignon's career took off in 2006 with Minédji, a hit song that remains beloved in Benin almost 20 years later. The West African country's ministry of culture remembered Mignon as ""an emblematic figure of the first generation of urban artists of the 2000s."" ""His songs, with their swaying rhythms and unique energy, marked an entire era and inspired many other talents,"" a statement from the ministry said. Mignon died on Tuesday, after being admitted to hospital in Burkina Faso's capital, Ouagadougou. The father-of-five had moved to neighbouring Burkina Faso two years ago, for professional reasons. After news of Mignon's death broke, his manager of nine years, Aziz Ademorou, described the musician as ""a fighter who always believed in himself"". Mignon had demonstrated this confidence in an interview with Benin's Frissons Radio. ""I started out with my first single Mindédji, which was both a trial and a master-stroke... the public loved it,"" he said. Mignon was also well known for creating a rhythm and dance style named Noudjihou. Noudjihou was inspired by Benin highlife music. Mignon's music had made an impression in his new home, Burkina Faso, too. In January last year he produced Hymnes Aux Étalons, an African Cup of Nations anthem for Burkina Faso's national team.

Hundreds of prisoners broke out of Munzenze prison last Monday, after fighters from the M23 rebel group began to take over the city. Between 165 and 167 women were assaulted by male inmates during the jailbreak, an internal UN document seen by the BBC says. The report states that most of the women were killed after the inmates set fire to the prison. The BBC has not been able to verify the reports. Goma, a major city of more than a million people, was captured after the Rwanda-backed M23 executed a rapid advance through eastern DR Congo. The city was plunged into chaos, with bodies lying in the streets and missiles reportedly flying over residential homes. Footage from last week's jailbreak showed people fleeing from the building as smoke rose in the background. Heavy gunfire could also be heard. In a separate video, people believed to be the escaped prisoners, filed through Goma's streets. The UN says at least 2,900 people were killed during the fighting, with 2,000 bodies buried and another 900 still in the city's morgues. Earlier this week, the rebels announced a ceasefire on humanitarian grounds. However, the M23 launched a new offensive on Wednesday, sources say, reportedly capturing the mining town of Nyabibwe. Nyabibwe is about 100 km (60 miles) from Bukavu - the east's second-largest city, and the reported target of the rebels' most recent advance. The Congolese authorities have enlisted hundreds of civilian volunteers to help defend Bukavu. Meanwhile, Malawi has announced it will start preparations for a withdrawal of its peacekeeping forces from the country. This follows the killing of three of its soldiers in the fighting around Goma. They were part of a southern African force, led by South Africa. Although 14 South Africans have been killed, President Cyril Ramaphosa has vowed to keep his forces in the country. Back in Goma, where residents are adapting to life under the M23, there are fears of a cholera outbreak. Stephan Goetghbuer, a regional lead from the charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), said: ""Access to water has been cut for days, corpses have been lying in the streets and waterborne diseases such as cholera are a real threat.

Several other pupils were injured and rushed to health centres in the town of Kauran Namoda, Zamfara state, for treatment. It is believed that the fire broke out in a nearby house on Tuesday night and spread to the school while the children, believed to be aged 10-16, were sleeping. The authorities say they are investigating the cause of the fire while they also try to help those injured recover. Local authorities and emergency responders were sent to the scene, but the fire had already resulted in significant casualties. Police spokesman Yazid Abubakar said the community buried the dead children on Wednesday afternoon. The location of the school made it difficult for those trying to stop the fire, eyewitness Yahaya Mahi told BBC Hausa. “Even if the firefighters had come on time, reaching the house would’ve been difficult due to the tight road leading to the house,” he said. Local official Mannir Haidara said other Islamic schools would be inspected to make sure they were not a fire risk. ”We’ll take measures to prevent another occurrence of this nature,” he said. The father of one of the victims told BBC Hausa that he was devastated but his faith in God was comforting him at this time. The authorities believe there were about 100 pupils in the school. They said many of the students came from different villages around Kaura Namoda, the second biggest town in Zamfara state. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

The Nelson Mandela Foundation described the Steyn as a ""larger than life character"" and ""someone Madiba [Mandela] regarded as a friend"". After his release from prison in 1990, Mandela spent six months at Steyn's former home in the affluent Johannesburg suburb, Saxonwold, where he edited his autobiography Long Walk to Freedom. ""He [Steyn] supported Madiba in numerous ways over many years. During 1992 Madiba lived in [Steyn's] home as he navigated his way through a very painful separation from Winnie Madikizela-Mandela."" South Africa's first democratically elected president also turned to Steyn ""when he needed spaces for retreat or support for his projects"", according to the foundation. Mandela spent 27 years in prison for campaigning to end white-minority rule. Eighteen of those years were spent on Robben Island, an island off Cape Town. Steyn began his entrepreneurial journey in 1975 when he founded Steyn's Insurance Brokers, according to another local news website BusinessLIVE. This would pave the way for the establishment of one of the country's leading insurance groups, Auto & General, and later BGL Insurance in the UK in the 1990s. BGL is the parent company of popular price comparison website Compare The Market. Auto & General was later incorporated into the Telesure Investment Holdings group, which offers a variety of financial service products in countries such as Australia, Turkey and the UK. Outside his business ventures, Steyn was known for his philanthropy. His family trust donated large sums to South Africa's Covid-19 relief efforts, with a considerable amount going towards supporting small businesses and providing food security for families affected by lockdown. The Steyn Foundation, established through Steyn City Properties, also supports impoverished townships. He leaves behind his wife and three children.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czj3w9k7gxxo,UK denies it faces paying billions more for Chagos deal,2025-02-05T10:22:11.915Z,Henry Zeffman Wedaeli Chibelushi & Frances Mao,"The UK government has denied claims made by the prime minister of Mauritius that it faces paying billions more under a renegotiated deal over the future of the Chagos Islands. Last October, the UK announced it would hand over sovereignty of the islands to Mauritius but would maintain a 99-year lease over the UK-US military airbase on the largest island, Diego Garcia. However, shortly after the deal was struck, Mauritius elected a new prime minister, Navin Ramgoolam, who wanted to reopen negotiations. He told his MPs on Tuesday new conditions had been negotiated meaning the UK's lease payments would be linked to inflation and frontloaded. But the UK Foreign Office said the figures being quoted were ""inaccurate and misleading"". ""The UK will only sign a deal that is in our national interest,"" a spokesperson said. The Times suggested that the payments by the UK government to Mauritius could effectively double from £9bn to £18bn, but this been denied by the UK Foreign Office. However some senior figures in government are opposed to the deal, describing it as ""terrible"", ""mad"" and ""impossible to understand"". ""At a time when there is no money, how can we spend billions of pounds to give something away?"", one senior government source said. Progress on the deal had been paused while the UK consulted new US President Donald Trump over the proposed agreement. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio has previously raised concerns, saying the deal posed a threat to US security, given China's influence in the region. Mauritius has an economic relationship with China. Environment Secretary Steve Reed said the UK government was ""still waiting"" for the view of the Trump administration. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Trump's view would ""inform the negotiations"", which began under the previous Tory government. Meanwhile, Ramgoolam said it would be ""better that Trump has a look at the agreement"" so the US president can see if it ""is good or not"". There had been efforts to get the deal signed before Trump's inauguration on 20 January. However, the UK changed course, saying it was ""perfectly reasonable for the US administration to consider the detail"" of any agreement. The Mauritian prime minister said he was ""confident"" the new deal would be approved, saying UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer had said he intended to ""push ahead"" with the renegotiated agreement. Speaking to Mauritian MPs on Tuesday, Ramgoolam railed against the former agreement, which he said was a ""sell-out"" for Mauritius. ""We have to be inflation-proof. What's the point of getting money and then having half of it by the end? This is what would happen, we have made the calculations,"" he said. However, he did not reveal the exact amount the UK would pay, saying: ""I'm not in a position to give details but let me say something, that package was very badly negotiated."" Ramgoolam said the previous package had also been tweaked so the UK would pay more in ""front-loading"" at the beginning of the deal. ""That also is being approved I think,"" the Mauritian leader added. Ramgoolam added that the UK would no longer be able to unilaterally act on a clause in the deal where the lease could be extended for 40 years. This was also denied by the UK government, with the Foreign Office spokesperson saying: ""There has been no change to the terms of extension in the treaty."" Shadow foreign secretary Dame Priti Patel urged the UK government to abandon the deal, saying there had been ""very little transparency"". She told Today: ""We keep hearing from the government that this is some kind of good deal - if it's such a good deal, why are they not being honest about what the details are? ""The government of Mauritius and the people of Mauritius seem to know more about this deal than the British public, the British taxpayer and even people in our own parliament."" Dame Priti said Sir Keir had ""the audacity to tell the British people they will foot the bill and pay for the indignity of his surrender of the Chagos Islands, as he isolates the new US administration by bending the knee to Mauritius and emboldening our enemies with his disastrous surrender deal"". Tory leader Kemi Badenoch said the prime minister should ""come to Parliament and be honest with MPs"" about what she called a ""foolish deal"". Reform UK leader Nigel Farage also voiced opposition to the deal, saying if the UK ceded sovereignty of the Chagos Islands, ""our value to America"" would become ""considerably reduced"". The UK took control of the Chagos Islands, or British Indian Ocean Territory, from its then colony, Mauritius, in 1965 and went on to evict its population of more than 1,000 people to make way for the Diego Garcia base. Mauritius, which won independence from the UK in 1968, has maintained the islands are its own, and the UN's highest court has ruled, in an advisory opinion, that the UK's administration of the territory is ""unlawful"". The Chagos islanders - some in Mauritius and the Seychelles, but others living in the UK - do not speak with one voice on the fate of their homeland. Some have criticised the deal, saying they were not consulted in the negotiations. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5y1r189m0o,"Ghana wants more for its cashews, but it's a tough nut to crack",2025-02-05T00:00:20.556Z,Ed Butler,"The Accra street vendor looks at me, bemused. I'm trying to establish how the rather flimsy 30g bag of roasted cashew nuts she's selling, beside a sweltering highway in Ghana's capital, costs me the equivalent of about 75 cents (60p). That's obviously not a lot of money for me, a visitor from the UK, but I'm amazed at the mark up. The price is at least 4,000% higher than the cost of buying the same weight of raw, unshelled cashews from a Ghanian farmer. ""It's incredible,"" I protest. Yet she doesn't understand my English, or my reasoning. The price of the nuts was, after all, printed on the packet. And explaining why I thought it was beyond the pale was never going to be easy. Ghana is the world's third-biggest exporter of unprocessed cashew nuts, behind Ivory Coast in first place, and Cambodia in second. To produce the crop, around 300,000 Ghanaians make at least part of their living growing cashews. Nashiru Seydou, whose family have a farm in the country's north-east, some 500 miles (800km) from Accra, is one of them. He says the work is hard, and unreliable supply chains and volatile wholesale prices make survival difficult. ""We are struggling. We can use the sunlight, the fertile land, to create more jobs,"" he says. ""I'd be happy if the government comes to our aid and helps support our industry."" He tells me that he currently gets around $50 for a large 100kg sack of unshelled cashews. ""It's amazing,"" says Bright Simons, an entrepreneur and economic commentator in Accra, who has studied the numbers. ""Roasters and retailers buy the nuts from farmers for $500 a tonne, and sell to customers [both at home and abroad] for amounts between $20,000 and $40,000 a tonne."" As a whole, Ghana grows about 180,000 tonnes of cashews annually. More than 80% is exported, and in raw, unshelled form. This generates some $300m in export revenues, but means that Ghana misses out on the significantly higher returns you get from roasted, ready-to-eat cashews. Mildred Akotia is one person trying to increase the amount of cashews that are shelled and roasted in Ghana. She is the founder and CEO of Akwaaba Fine Foods, which currently processes just 25 tonnes a year. Ms Akotia denies any suggestion that she and others like her are price-gouging. The packaging and roasting machinery a western business would automatically use in this industry, she says, is out of reach for her because of the high cost of credit in Ghana. ""If you go to a local bank, it will cost you 30% interest to get a loan,"" she complains. ""As a manufacturer you tell me how large your margins are that you can afford that kind of interest? We've had to rely on what we can get: soft loans from relatives and grants from donor agencies."" She says that this situation is why less than 20% of Ghana's cashews are processed locally. The bulk are scooped up and exported to big factories in countries like India, Thailand and Vietnam. Remarkably, some of those packaged nuts are then exported back to Ghana, where they are sold for the same price as domestically roasted cashews. This is despite the 20,000-mile sea freight round trip, and import costs. It is a similar picture for rice, which is exported to Ghana from Asia and sold at low prices, despite Ghana also growing the crop itself. Back in 2016 the Ghanaian government experimented with an export ban on raw cashews in order to encourage homegrown processing. However the policy had to be abandoned within a couple of weeks after uproar from farmers and traders. Without available cheap loans, it wasn't possible for sufficient new Ghanaian roasters to enter the market. So the price of raw nuts crashed, and many started rotting for want of a buyer. More recently there has been talk of increased tariffs on raw cashew exports and bans on exporters purchasing cashews directly from farms. But all these policy interventions miss a key point, according to Mr Simons. A big challenge for local producers, he says, is to work harder on the basics of doing business, and growing their companies. ""In order to be efficient at this, you need scale,"" he says, adding that firms need to promote eating cashews to make it more widespread in the country. ""You need a lot of a Ghanaians consuming the nuts, not just a small middle class"". Prof Daron Acemoglu, a Turkish-American economist, agrees that building a strong local market is important for Ghana's cashew industry. He was one of last year's winners of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences, for his work on the struggles facing low-income economies, and in particular their home-grown businesses. Yet he says that the first priority should be improving access to international markets for processed Ghanaian cashews. ""These firms are dealing with workforces that aren't properly skilled, they have infrastructures that aren't working, they are constantly in fear of corrupt officials, or rule changes, and also it's very difficult to reach foreign markets, he says. ""They need the foreign market because the domestic market is small, and their own government has very little capacity [to boost it]."" He also wants to see the Ghanaian government improve the network of roads and railways to ease the cost of transportation. But Mr Simons reckons the onus should now be on Ghanaian businesses themselves, to do the basics to enhance the branding and marketing of cashews. As it is, he says, many of the country's most enterprising business people are just leaving Ghana for better paid opportunities abroad because of the red tape and cronyism in Ghana are so prohibitive. ""There's a massive brain drain,"" he says. ""My theory of why Africa's economic development has been slow is because we focus too much on the supply side, but the real beauty is in demand, creating a consuming class of cashew-eating enthusiasts, and you don't have an entrepreneurial class that can create demand transformation."" He says the same argument applies to Ghana's other bigger exports, like gold and chocolate, neither of which gets much value-addition within Ghana before getting exported to the West. Mildred Akotia hopes she might be one of those entrepreneurs to buck the trend. She now wants to build her own logistics arm, to be able to process the cashews direct from the farm gate. ""I have a lot of calls from the UAE, from Canada and America. Currently we can't meet demand. We can't get enough kernels to roast. ""There's a ready market both locally and internationally. My branding is good, my marketing is good. My dream is to give a facelift to Ghanaian processed foods."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0m1ge1xnm2o,S Africa church apologises over exposing children to risk from abuser,2025-02-04T14:59:25.732Z,Khanyisile Ngcobo,"The Anglican Church of Southern Africa (Acsa) has apologised for failing to protect the public from the risk posed by a prolific British child abuser who had moved to South African in 2001. Senior barrister John Smyth, who died in South Africa in 2018 at the age of 77, abused over 100 children and young men in the UK and Zimbabwe in the 1970s and 1980s. He met many of them at Christian camps that he organised. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, resigned last year following the publication of an independent review into the matter. It found that Mr Welby and other church leaders ""could and should"" have formally reported Smyth in 2013 to police in the UK and authorities in South Africa. Smyth moved to Zimbabwe with his wife and four children from Winchester in England in 1984, two years after a report, which was not made public at the time, detailed the physical abuse he meted out. His 2001 move to South Africa came after an investigation into his activities in Zimbabwe, the findings of which were not widely circulated. A fresh enquiry commissioned last year by Archbishop of Cape Town Thabo Makgoba found that while no similar cases of abuse were ""ascertainable on record"" in South Africa, ""there was a very high risk that they could have happened"". The independent report found that while the Church had no prior warnings of Smyth's abuses until 2013, its ""further communication of that warning within Acsa between 2013 and Smyth's death in 2018... fell short"". Smyth died at his home in Cape Town shortly after a heart procedure. It was just a week after a request that he be summoned back to the UK was submitted. ""We find that the protective measures in place within Acsa at the time Smyth lived in South Africa inadequately mitigated the serious risk of such conduct being repeated here by Smyth, or others,"" the latest investigation found. It details Smyth's activities following his move to South Africa. It says that Smyth joined an Anglican community in Durban, where he occasionally preached and was part of a team running confirmation classes that exposed him to young children. He and his wife Anne ""abruptly"" left that community at some point in 2003 or 2004 after the church's leaders confronted Smyth with information about his abusive behaviour, the report says. The couple then moved to Cape Town and joined another Anglican community. In August 2013, the ""first warning to Acsa"" on Smyth's behaviour was sent to Bishop Garth Counsell by the Diocese of Ely in the UK and by the end of the year, the couple left the Anglican Church for a different Christian community, Church-on-Main. They would later return to an Anglican church just shortly before Smyth's death. And while another bishop, Peter Lee, had also ""heard informally"" about the abuses prior to his arrival in South Africa in 1976, the report found that neither clergyman were ""remiss in any duty to pass on what had reached them regarding Smyth"". ""But... Counsell and revd [Allan] Smith erred in failing to inform the authorities at Church-on-Main of what they had learned about Smyth from the letter received from the Diocese of Ely."" The report says that though there were no allegations of Smyth continuing his abusive behaviour in South Africa ""what... is evident... is that from 2001 on, young members of Acsa were exposed to the real risk of Smyth perpetrating in South Africa the serial abuse documented in the UK and Zimbabwe"". In a statement on Tuesday, Archbishop Makgoba acknowledged the Church's failure to protect its congregants and ""wider community"" from Smyth's potential abuse. He also detailed several steps he would submit to the church's leadership at their next meeting to be ""implemented as a matter of urgency"". Correction 7 February: This story has been updated to clarify who had failed to inform the authorities at Church-on-Main - it was Bishop Counsell and Revd Smith, not Bishop Lee.

The convicted men attacked Dahare Abubakar, 67, as she was working on her farm, beating and stabbing her to death. Ms Abubakar's family went to the authorities and the suspects were swiftly arrested in a village 45km (28 miles) from Kano - the largest city in northern Nigeria. The case gained attention across the country and raised discussions over how people in rural areas continue to be murdered following witchcraft accusations. The ones who make the claims without any proof believe that those they accuse are responsible for either a death of a family member, sickness or misfortune. Giving his ruling, Judge Usman Na'abba said the the prosecution had proven its case against the five men beyond reasonable doubt. The prosecutor, Abba Sorondiki, said he hoped the judgement would deter others from making wrongful accusations and then taking matters into their own hands. The court heard that the victim was murdered after the sick wife of one of the accused, Abdulaziz Yahaya, had a dream that she was being pursued by Ms Abubakar, who was holding a knife. Yahaya then organised a group to confront Ms Abubakar, which resulted in her murder. ""There have been similar cases like this but this is the first time we are seeing up to five people sentenced to death for murder over wrongful witchcraft accusation,"" Mr Sorondiki told the BBC. The victim's son, Musa Yahaya, said that the day his mother was killed was the worst day of his life and that he was pleased to see justice being served. ""I am happy because they would get the same treatment they meted out to my mother,"" he said. Defence lawyer Ma'aruf Yakasai said his clients plan to appeal against the verdict. The death penalty is rarely carried out in Nigeria and those convicted often spend the rest of their lives in prison on death row. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gp4kqer46o,Uganda begins Ebola vaccine trial after new outbreak,2025-02-04T09:28:16.111Z,Dorcas Wangira,"Uganda has launched a trial of a vaccine against the Sudan strain of the Ebola virus, following an outbreak in the country that has killed one person and infected two others. The first patient, a 32-year-old male nurse, died last week. On Monday, the initial participant in the trial, who is currently in isolation, received a dose of the vaccine, which was developed by the International Aids Vaccine Initiative, a global non-profit organisation. There is currently no approved vaccine for the Sudan strain of Ebola. One does exist, however, for the Zaire strain, which has been prevalent in the past in the Democratic Republic of Congo. Symptoms of Ebola infection include fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat, followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, and internal and external bleeding. It is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids and tissues. The Sudan Ebola virus is severe, killing at least 40% of those infected, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Uganda is currently experiencing its sixth outbreak of the disease. Forty contacts of the first victim of this outbreak will be vaccinated in this phase of the roll-out jointly conducted with the Ugandan authorities and the WHO, the UN agency said in a statement on Monday. Uganda's health ministry has confirmed 234 contacts as listed for monitoring. The WHO is collaborating with Uganda's ministry of health, the Uganda Virus Research Institute, and the Makerere University Lung Institute to conduct the trial. ""This marks a major milestone in public health emergency response and demonstrates the power of collaboration for global health security,"" said WHO director for Africa Matshidiso Moeti. ""If proven effective, the vaccine will further strengthen measures to protect communities from future outbreaks."" The previous outbreak of the Sudan strain in Uganda was confirmed in September 2022 and resulted in more than 70 deaths. It was declared over in January 2023. Although Uganda had access to the same candidate vaccine at the time, trials could not be conducted before the outbreak ended. Over the weekend, the first 2,160 doses of the trial vaccine and treatments arrived in the capital, Kampala. Health authorities and research teams worked swiftly to prepare for the trial, including briefing researchers, arranging logistics and developing study protocols.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjexnzl372wo,Rebels declare ceasefire in DR Congo for 'humanitarian reasons',2025-02-03T21:24:51.654Z,Will Ross Hafsa Khalil,"The alliance of rebel groups in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo have declared a humanitarian ceasefire starting on Tuesday. In a statement, the group - which includes the Rwanda-backed M23 rebels - cited ""humanitarian reasons"" for the ceasefire, after it has been capturing territory in eastern parts of the country. The UN said at least 900 people have been killed and 2,880 injured in recent fighting in and around Goma, DR Congo's largest eastern city, after it was seized by rebels. The G7 nations and the EU have condemned the offensive as a flagrant violation of DR Congo's sovereignty. The alliance of rebel groups - known as the Congo River Alliance - has accused the Congolese military of killing people using aircrafts to bomb areas it holds. It added it does not intend to seize any further territory, despite saying otherwise last week, and it will hold its positions. In a statement, the alliance said: ""We reiterate our commitment to protecting and defending the civilian population and our positions."" Regional fighting has seen hundreds of thousands of people displaced over the last three years. Since the start of 2025, more than 400,000 people have been forced from their homes, according to the UN's refugee agency. Rwandan President Paul Kagame - who is also commander-in-chief of the Rwanda Defence Force - said he did not know if his country's troops were in the DR Congo. ""There are many things I don't know. But if you want to ask me, is there a problem in Congo that concerns Rwanda? And that Rwanda would do anything to protect itself? I'd say 100%,"" he told CNN on Monday. Meanwhile, human rights groups have been calling for more pressure on Rwanda to back down. The DR Congo's communications minister called for the international community to impose sanctions on Rwanda. ""A strong decision (must be taken) not only to condemn, but to stop what Rwanda is doing, because it is not acceptable if you want to preserve peace in Africa and in our region,"" Patrick Muyaya told Reuters. ""Sanctions are the minimum,"" he added. The Congolese and Rwandan presidents are due to attend a regional peace summit in Tanzania on Friday. With 30 years of conflict behind them, it is expected that any negotiations if they do not break down - as they have several times in the last year - could go on for months."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn01z1yy0jno,Trump threatens to cut funding for South Africa over land policy,2025-02-03T15:43:34.271Z,Basillioh Rukanga in Nairobi & Khanyisile Ngcobo in Johannesburg,"US President Donald Trump has said he will cut all future funding to South Africa over allegations that it was confiscating land and ""treating certain classes of people very badly"". Last month, President Cyril Ramaphosa signed into law a bill that allows land seizures without compensation in certain circumstances. Land ownership has long been a contentious issue in South Africa with most private farmland owned by white people, 30 years after the end of the racist system of apartheid. There have been continuous calls for the government to address land reform and deal with the past injustices of racial segregation. South Africa's president responded to Trump with a post on X: ""South Africa is a constitutional democracy that is deeply rooted in the rule of law, justice and equality. The South African government has not confiscated any land."" He added that the only funding South Africa received from the US was through the health initiative Pepfar, which represented ""17% of South Africa's HIV/Aids programme"". The US allocated about $440m (£358m) in assistance to South Africa in 2023, according to US government data. Elon Musk, who was born and grew up in South Africa and is now a Trump adviser, has also joined in the debate, saying the new law discriminated against white people. ""Why do you have openly racist ownership laws?"" Mr Musk said to Ramaphosa in a post on X. On Sunday, Trump wrote on his social media platform Truth Social: ""I will be cutting off all future funding to South Africa until a full investigation of this situation has been completed!"" He later said, in a briefing with journalists, that South Africa's ""leadership is doing some terrible things, horrible things"". ""So that's under investigation right now. We'll make a determination, and until such time as we find out what South Africa is doing — they're taking away land and confiscating land, and actually they're doing things that are perhaps far worse than that."" South Africa's new law allows for expropriation without compensation only in circumstances where it is ""just and equitable and in the public interest"" to do so. This includes if the property is not being used and there is no intention to either develop or make money from it, or when it poses a risk to people. Land ownership has been a burning issue in South Africa for more than a century. In 1913, the British colonial authorities passed legislation that restricted the property rights of the country's black majority. The Natives Land Act left the vast majority of the land under the control of the white minority and set the foundation for the forced removal of black people to poor homelands and townships in the intervening decades until the end of apartheid three decades ago. Anger over these forced removals intensified the fight against white-minority rule. In 1994, leader of the African National Congress (ANC) Nelson Mandela became the country's first democratically elected president after all South Africans were given the right to vote. But until the recently passed law, the government was only able to buy land from its current owners under the principle of ""willing seller, willing buyer"", which some feel has delayed the process of land reform. In 2017, a government report said that of the farmland that was in the hands of private individuals, 72% was white-owned. According to the 2022 census white people make up 7.3% of the population. However, some critics have expressed fears that the new land law may have disastrous consequences like in Zimbabwe, where seizures wrecked the economy and scared away investors. South African Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe responded to Trump's comments by telling a mining conference that the country should withhold its minerals if ""they [US] don't give us money"". South Africa exports a variety of minerals to the US, including platinum, iron and manganese. AfriForum, a group focused on protecting the rights and interests of South Africa's white Afrikaner population, wants the government to change the new law to ""ensure the protection of property rights"". However, it said it did not agree with Trump's threat to cut funding, suggesting that any punitive measures should be directed at ""senior ANC leaders"" and not South Africans. The ANC, led by Ramaphosa, currently governs South Africa as part of a coalition government with nine smaller parties. Trump also hit out at South Africa during his first term as US president, asking the-then US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to study the country's ""farm seizures and expropriations and the large-scale killing of farmers"". At that time, South Africa accused Trump of seeking to sow division, with a spokesperson saying he was ""misinformed"". Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

In an emotional acceptance speech on Sunday evening, she said her ""heart was beating so fast"". It is only the second year since the category's introduction, a move that was widely welcomed as a recognition of the impact of African artists on the global music scene. However, there was some controversy this year as US R&B star Chris Brown was one of the nominees - for his song Sensational, which incorporates Afrobeats elements and features guest vocals from Nigerian artists Davido and Lojay. Tems was out of breath as she took to the stage after her name was read out at the awards ceremony in Los Angeles. ""I do work out but it's not showing up right now,"" she joked as she patted her heart to the amusement of the audience. The 29-year-old also praised her mother. “Wow, dear God thank you so much for putting me on this stage and bringing this team, and tomorrow is my mum’s birthday and this is her first Grammys. “I just want to thank you mum,"" she said gesturing towards her, ""because she has done a lot for me and my brother.” Love Me Jeje, which samples a line from Seyi Sodimu's 1997 Nigerian classic of the same name, has racked up 125 million listens on Spotify and 21 million views on YouTube. With Sunday's prize, Tems has become the first Nigerian to have two Grammys to her name after winning the Best Melodic Rap Performance in 2023 for featuring on Future's hit Wait For U. Nigeria’s President Bola Tinubu has joined in the congratulations, commending the singer for bringing ""pride"" to the country on the global stage for the ""second time"". Aside from the Best African Music Performance, Tems was nominated in two other categories - Best Global Music Album for Born in the Wild and Best R&B Song for Burning. Across her career she has now received eight nominations in all. She began making a name for herself in 2018 with the release of her self-produced debut single Mr Rebel. Tems gained further attention in 2019 with Try Me. Her international profile was boosted after being featured on Wizkid's song Essence, which earned her several award nominations, including one for a Grammy.

Francis Yaw Frimpong, better known as Pooley, was killed following a heated argument with an unidentified man during the game, according to a statement from Nsoatreman. ""The senseless loss of life is devastating,"" said his club Asante Kotoko. Violence at football matches has been a persistent issue in Ghana. In 2001, a riot in the capital, Accra, led to the death of at least 120 people. Sunday's match in the central town of Nsoatre was also marred by fan violence, with people throwing objects onto the pitch. Things escalated when some spectators stormed the field, attacking players and officials. Asante Kotoko said their goalkeeper, Mohammed Camara, was assaulted by ""pitch invaders"" during the chaos. The match resumed after a brief halt, with Asante Kotoko ultimately losing 1-0 to Nsoatreman. Both teams, Asante Kotoko and Nsoatreman, have condemned the clashes. ""The game of football is not a war,"" said Nsoatreman in a statement. Tributes for Pooley have been pouring in, with his name trending in Ghana on X. A passionate Asante Kotoko fan, he frequently discussed his team on the radio. In response to the incident, the Ghana Football Association (GFA) has banned Nsoatreman from using their home venue, Nana Koramansah Park, until further notice while an investigation is conducted. Additionally, the GFA has postponed the next round of league matches. ""The GFA has been working to improve the overall football experience in Ghana and is keen to ensure that this incident is dealt with swiftly and decisively to send the signal that such acts have no place in Ghana football,"" the association said in a statement on Monday. The authorities have launched an investigation into Mr Frimpong's death. People have called for stricter security measures at match venues across the country for a league that has lost its appeal in the last few years. Despite previous sanctions aimed at improving safety, such as fines issued in 2022 for Nsoatreman and Accra Young Wise for breaching safety regulations, and a seven-game home ban handed to Skyy, violence remains a problem. Attacks on match officials and opposing teams persist, raising concerns about the effectiveness of current security measures. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2yxw11zlgo,'People are afraid': BBC visits DR Congo city under rebel control,2025-02-03T00:28:48.522Z,Paul Njie,"When I first drove into the city of Goma in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, it was hard to tell I had entered a conflict zone. Goma residents filled the streets a few miles from the border with Rwanda - commuters headed to work, hawkers sold goods by the roadside and taxi drivers scrambled to win customers. But it only took a few minutes to realise there was a new ""government"" in town. As I reached a checkpoint near a police post formerly run by the Congolese authorities, gun-toting fighters from the M23 rebel group stopped my car. The M23 captured Goma, a city of nearly two million people, last week after a lightning advance in DR Congo's eastern region. At least 700 people in the city were killed and close to 3,000 injured as the rebels clashed with DR Congo's army and its allies, according to the UN and the Congolese government. The M23, which is made up of ethnic Tutsis, say they are fighting for the rights of their minority group, while DR Congo's government says the Rwanda-backed rebels are seeking to exploit the eastern region's vast mineral wealth. At the checkpoint, rebel fighters peered into my car, asked my driver a few brief questions, then waved us into the devastated city. The rebels faced no opposition - it was like they had always been there. I made my way to one of the few hospitals treating wounded victims and as I entered, cries of pain echoed through the corridors. I met Nathaniel Cirho, a medical doctor who, in a strange role reversal, sat in a hospital bed with a sling around his left arm. A bomb had landed on the house next to his and Mr Cirho and his neighbours were struck by the resulting shrapnel. ""I sustained an injury on my arm. A 65-year-old man was injured on his abdomen. After surgery, he didn't survive,"" he said sadly. Several wards away, an elderly woman lay in her another hospital bed, hooked up to an oxygen tank. She had plucked a bullet out of her own arm after a fierce exchange of fire broke out in her neighbourhood. ""Suddenly my hand felt cold, and I realised I had been shot,"" she said, struggling to talk. For days, she had nursed the gunshot wound without help. She told me she was eventually escorted to a public hospital by M23 fighters. The woman asked to be moved to a private hospital, where she is now receiving treatment, because she was not getting adequate attention from the overstretched doctors. But even at this second hospital, medics were overwhelmed as an increasing number of patients came through the doors. ""We have treated most of them because we had contingency plans,"" said a doctor, who did not want to be named for security reasons. He added: ""On Sunday when the fighting began, we received 315 patients and we treated them."" But now, the hospital counts over 700 patients with various degrees of injury, the doctor told me. He spoke of receiving patients with ""gunshot wounds to the head, others on the chest, stomach, hands and legs"". As DR Congo reels from the shock of seeing Goma captured, the UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights has warned that sexual violence is being used as a weapon of war by rival groups. The doctor in this private hospital corroborated the UN's statement, saying his facility had so far received about 10 victims of rape and gender-based violence. Outside the hospital and into the city centre, there was a mixture of serenity and circumspection. People walked past four bullet-riddled vans, testimony to what had played out while they were sheltering for safety. Although the gunfire and explosions in Goma have all but died down, not all establishments are back to business as normal. A few shops have opened in certain streets, but not in others. Major banks also remain shuttered. Perhaps some remain wary that anything could happen amid the volatile security situation in the wider North Kivu province. ""People are afraid… I am still afraid because those who caused the tension are still with us and we don't know what is going on,"" shop owner Sammy Matabishi said. ""But the bad thing is that there are no people to buy from us, many have gone to Rwanda, [the Congolese city of] Bukavu, Kenya and Uganda."" He adds that traders who import goods from neighbouring countries have been unable to transport products into city. Many residents I spoke to said they had come to terms with the M23 running the place. And as an outsider I could see the rebels were intent on asserting their control. They had taken over the office of the North Kivu military governor, who they had killed as they advanced on Goma. Fighters were also present in strategic areas around the city, while others patrolled the streets on pick-up trucks, weapons in hand. During the whole time I was in Goma, I did not see a single active Congolese soldier. I did, however, see abandoned trucks emblazoned with ""FARDC"", the French acronym for DR Congo's armed forces. Near the base of the UN peacekeeping mission (Monusco) - who have been tasked with protecting civilians from rebel forces - military fatigues, magazines and bullets were strewn across the road. ""When M23 arrived here, they surrounded our army,"" Richard Ali, who lives nearby, told me. ""Many removed their military uniforms, threw away their weapons and wore civilian clothes. Others ran away."" As the M23 rejoices over its conquest, the Congolese government continues to deny the rebels' claim that they have totally captured Goma. The authorities accuses the M23 of illegally occupying their land - with the support of Rwanda - and promises to recover any lost territory. Although Rwanda used to consistently deny backing the rebels, its response has shifted to a more defensive one, in which government spokespeople state that fighting near its border is a security threat. The rebels are now reported to be moving south towards Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu, and have vowed to reach the capital, Kinshasa, even though it is 2,600km (1,600 miles) away. For now, Goma remains their biggest coup. Conditions there foreshadow what life could become for many more Congolese people, should the M23 gain more ground.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c39142l9nkyo,Shelling at busy Sudanese market 'fills mortuary with bodies',2025-02-02T11:33:31.343Z,Wedaeli Chibelushi,"Shelling at a busy market near Sudan's capital has filled a mortuary with bodies, medical charity Doctors Without Borders (MSF) says. MSF and the Sudanese authorities said the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) were responsible for Saturday's attack in the city of Omdurman, which killed and injured more than 100 people - a claim the RSF has denied. The majority of those killed at the market were women and children, the Sudanese Doctors' Union says. The RSF and Sudan's army have been locked in a civil war that, over 22 months, has killed tens of thousands and sparked what the UN describes as one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters. In the past few weeks, the army has stepped up its offensive in Omdurman, which lies across the River Nile from capital city, Khartoum, aiming to regain complete control from the RSF. Eyewitnesses told the AFP news agency that Saturday's artillery shelling had come from western Omdurman, where the RSF remains in control. Saturday's explosion caused ""utter carnage"" at the nearby Al Nao hospital, which was overwhelmed with injured patients, MSF general secretary Chris Lockyear said. The Sudanese Doctors' Union appealed for nearby medics to assist at the hospital, saying there was an ""acute shortage of medical staff"". It added that one shell had fallen ""metres away"" from the hospital on Saturday. One survivor of the market attack told the AFP news agency: ""The shells hit in the middle of the vegetable market, that's why the victims and the wounded are so many."" Both sides have been accused of targeting civilians, including health workers, and indiscriminate shelling of residential areas. The recent skirmishes have forced emergency response rooms to shut several health centres, affecting the provision of medical services to thousands of residents.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gxe7xxjd0o,Who should count as African at the Grammy Awards?,2025-02-02T00:22:39.662Z,Marco Oriunto,"The Grammy Awards has a dedicated space for African music, but just a year after the category's introduction it is already proving contentious. The Best African Music Performance made its debut with South Africa's Tyla winning for her hit song Water, a blend of South African amapiano and Afropop. It was a move welcomed across the industry, especially by African artists. But the nominations for this year's award have raised eyebrows, especially with the inclusion of US R&B star Chris Brown. The 35-year-old has been nominated for his chart-topping single Sensational, which incorporates Afrobeats elements and features guest vocals from Nigerian artists Davido and Lojay. However, the participation of an American artist in an African music category has sparked some debate. Should non-African artists be considered in a category meant to showcase African talent? ""Music is about inclusivity. We don't want to fence people out of genres,"" Grammy CEO Harvey Mason Jr tells the BBC. ""If we start deciding who can or can't make a certain type of music, we lose the essence of creativity."" The head of the Grammys explains that such cross-fertilisation is expected. ""We've seen it with Latin before, we've seen it with K-Pop and now you're starting to see it with Afrobeats and amapiano,"" he says. ""We like to honour all music [regardless of] where it comes from or who makes it. If it's excellent we want to celebrate it."" Another bone of contention this year is the dominance of Afrobeats, which has its roots in Nigeria and Ghana. There is a feeling that the Grammys remain too focused on it, to the exclusion of other African music genres, despite calls for inclusivity. Nigerian music journalist Ayomide Tayo says he understands why Afrobeats is dominating this year's awards. ""I don't think Afrobeats is better,"" he tells the BBC. ""It's just that Afrobeats has had over three decades of exposure. We consistently pushed great music, superstars and events that have attracted the world to it,"" Lagos-based Tayo explains. Nigerians living abroad have also played a crucial role in the popularisation of Afrobeats. ""The Nigerian diaspora in England and North America is one of the key factors why Afrobeats exploded in Europe and the US,"" Tayo says. While other Africa-based music business professionals see a bright future for other African music genres, saying this year could be a one-off. For example, amapiano, a genre that in 2023 surpassed 1.4 billion streams on the music app Spotify. Raphael Benza, head of Johannesburg-based record label Vth Season, says the very name Best African Performance goes against pigeonholing. ""Coming from the home of amapiano, I would say [musicians] are doing extremely good work and I think next year you'll see amapiano artists being nominated in this category,"" he tells the BBC. The Best African Music Performance category was introduced as a way to honour Africa's increasing influence on global music. When Tyla won, she beat Nigerian heavyweights like Davido and Burna Boy, establishing her place on the international stage. Since then, the 22-year-old has been spotted at the Met Gala in New York and has been featured in top fashion magazines, proving that the Grammys effect is real. This year's nominees, however, have shifted almost entirely to Nigerian artists, with Yemi Alade, Burna Boy, Tems and a joint nomination for Asake & Wizkid, as well as Davido and Lojay featuring on Chris Brown's hit. ""To be fair to Chris Brown, he has been invested in Afrobeats and African music for a long time,"" says Tayo, explaining that the US musician flew to Nigeria to collaborate with Davido and Wizkid. ""We have an inside joke in Nigeria that we say Chris Brown is Nigerian, because of the ways he pops up in our songs and our music videos all the time."" Last month, he also held two massive sell-out concerts at a 90,000-seater stadium in Johannesburg - with people travelling from across southern Africa to see his performance, which fans said was electrifying. African musicians have won Grammys long before the Best African Music Performance Award was established. South Africa's Mariam Makeba was the first to win one - Best Folk Recording - in 1966 for her collaboration with Harry Belafonte, called simply An Evening with Belafonte/Makeba. African artists became more of a feature after 1992, with the introduction of the Best World Music Album. That category has gone through various guises over the years - including being split into traditional and contemporary world music awards - and is now known as Best Global Music Album. Multi-award winners include Angélique Kidjo, Youssou N'Dour, Ali Farka Touré and Ladysmith Black Mambazo. But African musicians have often broken out of that category for example, South Africa's Black Coffee won Best Dance/Electronic Album in 2022. The hope is that to counter the dominance of Afrobeats, more categories from Africa will be offered at the Grammys in years to come. This would cover the ever-growing popularity of African music globally - and better reflect the huge number of music styles produced in Africa.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78xvgvy172o,At least 700 killed in DR Congo fighting since Sunday - UN,2025-01-31T22:07:57.137Z,Jaroslav Lukiv,"The UN says at least 700 people have been killed in intense fighting in Goma, the largest city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, since Sunday. UN spokesman Stéphane Dujarric said 2,800 people have been injured, as M23 rebels - backed by Rwanda - captured the capital of North Kivu province. The rebels are now reported to be moving south towards Bukavu, the capital of South Kivu. The conflict in eastern DR Congo dates back to the 1990s but has rapidly escalated in recent weeks. M23, which is made up of ethnic Tutsis, say they are fighting for minority rights, while DR Congo's government says the Rwanda-backed rebels are seeking control of the eastern region's vast mineral wealth. On Friday, Dujarric said the casualty figures came from an assessment made by the World Health Organization and its partners, alongside the DR Congo's government, between Sunday and Thursday. The UN spokesman also warned the death toll would rise further. In an attempt to halt M23's progress, the DR Congo military has set up a defensive line on the road between Goma and Bukavu, according to the AFP news agency. Hundreds of civilian volunteers have been enlisted to defend Bukavu. One young man told the AFP: ""I am ready to die for my country."" Jean-Jacques Purusi Sadiki, the governor of South Kivu - the province M23 are marching on - told Reuters news agency the government army and its allies were holding back the rebels, though that claim has not been independently verified. Earlier this week, M23 vowed to continue its offensive until it reached the capital Kinshasa, about 2,600km (1,600 miles) to the west. Thérèse Kayikwamba Wagner, the country's foreign minister, told the BBC that Rwanda was illegally occupying her country and attempting to orchestrate regime change. Wagner said the international community had allowed Rwandan President Paul Kagame decades of impunity and failed to hold him accountable for violating international law. Rwanda's government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo denied the accusation, saying the country's troops were only deployed to prevent the conflict spilling over to its territory. ""We're not interested in war, we're not interested in annexation, we're not interested in regime change,"" Makolo told the BBC's Newsday programme. UN experts estimated last year that Rwanda had between 3,000 and 4,000 troops operating alongside the M23 in eastern DR Congo. On Friday, the Southern African Development Community (Sadc) regional bloc declared its support for DR Congo at a crisis summit in Zimbabwe. In a statement, the 16-member group ""reaffirmed its solidarity and unwavering commitment to continue supporting the DRC in its pursuit of safeguarding its independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity"". Sadc has sent peacekeeping troops, primarily from South Africa, to DR Congo to combat armed groups like the M23 and restore peace in the mineral-rich region after decades of unrest. Sixteen soldiers from southern African countries have been killed in clashes with the M23 around Goma in the past week. The fighting has also worsened the humanitarian crisis in eastern DR Congo. Shelley Thakral, from the UN's World Food Programme, said the city's residents were running out of food, clean water and medical supplies. ""The supply chain has really been strangled at the moment if you think about land access, air access, when everything is closed down,"" she told AFP. Since the start of 2025, more than 400,000 people have been forced from their homes, according to the UN's refugee agency. DR Congo is Africa's second-largest country - about two-thirds the size of Western Europe - and borders nine different countries. Previous conflicts in the country during the 1990s drew in several neighbours and were dubbed Africa's World Wars."

""The peace and security of our region is a shared obligation,"" Zimbabwe President Emmerson Mnangagwa, the current Sadc chairman, said. Sadc has sent peacekeeping troops, primarily from South Africa, to DR Congo to combat armed groups like the M23 and restore peace in the mineral-rich region after decades of unrest. Sixteen soldiers from southern African countries have been killed in clashes with the M23 around Goma in the past week. In a public spat on X with his South African counterpart, Rwanda's President Kagame said the Sadc troops were ""not a peacekeeping force, and it has no place in this situation"". The fighting has worsened the humanitarian crisis in eastern DR Congo as the M23 has captured large areas of North Kivu province, around Goma. Shelley Thakral, from the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) said the city's residents were running out of food, clean water and medical supplies. ""The supply chain has really been strangled at the moment if you think about land access, air access, when everything is closed down,"" she told AFP. Since the start of 2025, more than 400,000 people have been forced from their homes, according to the UN's refugee agency. Spokesperson for the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Jeremy Laurence said there had been reports of sexual violence by Congolese troops. There are reports that at least 50 women had been raped, some by several men, in South Kivu, he said. The M23 has also killed at least 12 people in summary executions since the crisis started, according to the UN. The Rwandan spokesperson asserted that the country's troops were securing their borders in response to ""repeated violations"", including 15 deaths, from cross-border shelling. ""The DRC needs to do a better job of getting their territory in order. That is their responsibility,"" she said. Ms Makolo added that Rwanda was placing ""heavily defensive mechanisms, and offensive mechanisms"" along the border to safeguard its investment. She also said that Rwanda was concerned about the presence in DR Congo of militias responsible for the 1994 Rwandan genocide, and which wanted to return to Rwanda to ""finish the job"". She accused the Congolese authorities of working with these groups. The Congolese foreign minister also accused Rwanda of occupying DR Congo in order to exploit its vast mineral resources, such as gold and coltan, which is used to make batteries for mobile phones and electric vehicles. ""I think that Rwanda ought to be under an embargo for all of its mineral exportations, they should not be benefiting from what has been mined illegally and under forced labour in the eastern DRC,"" she said. This was denied by Ms Makolo. Ms Wagner called for a halt to foreign aid being sent to Rwanda and sanctions to be placed on the leaders ""enabling this warfare"". Foreign donors, like the UK and Germany, have already threatened to suspend aid. She also called for Rwanda's troops to be suspended from UN peacekeeping missions around the world. ""We have to witness a country that presents itself as a peace-bringer in other countries, be(ing) a warmonger in the Great Lakes region,"" she said. UN experts said last year that Rwanda had between 3,000 and 4,000 troops operating alongside the M23 in eastern DR Congo. Human Rights Watch has warned of escalating risks to civilians as DR Congo's army battle the M23 rebels. The humanitarian group has accused both sides of committing grave abuses against civilians. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has warned that the current conflict risks escalating into a broader regional war. Uganda's army has said it will strengthen its defences along the border with DR Congo in response to the increased fighting.

Police were called into the meeting - held to vet Ghana's new ministerial appointments - as MPs damaged tables and microphones. The vetting committee had disagreed over a number of issues, with some accusing opposition MPs of dragging out the process in order to settle political scores. On Friday morning the vetting committee's chairman apologised to the Ghanaian public, calling it ""totally unacceptable"". The cross-party committee had been scheduled to vet three lawmakers from the governing National Democratic Congress (NDC). The trio had been nominated for ministerial positions after the NDC triumphed over the New Patriotic Party (NPP) in December's elections. However, NDC MPs accused Alexander Afenyo-Markin, the NPP's leader in parliament, of questioning the ministerial nominees for an unnecessarily long time. More than five hours were spent on vetting just one nominee - communications minister designate Samuel Nartey George. Many NDC MPs believe this was a form of payback from opposition MPs on the committee, who wanted George to retract his criticism of former president and NPP leader Nana Akufo-Addo and Akufo-Addo's Vice-President Mahamadu Bawumia. Members of the vetting committee ended up on their feet - shouting, pushing and shoving each other and upturning tables. As a result, the Speaker of parliament suspended four lawmakers - three from the NPP and one from the governing party - for two weeks. On Friday, the NPP's Afenyo-Markin said parliamentary customs allowed committee members ""the opportunity to enquire deeply into every nominee of the president, without limit to questions"". He accused the NDC of trying to ""frustrate"" this process. As a result of the chaos, the vetting ended up being adjourned until Friday. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

It is rich in natural resources but has suffered from political instability, a lack of infrastructure, centuries of both commercial and colonial exploitation, and little widespread development since independence. During the two Congo wars, from 1996-2003 the country was at the centre of what some observers call ""Africa's world war"", with widespread civilian suffering. The war claimed an up to six million lives, either as a direct result of fighting or because of disease and malnutrition. Since the late-2000s, there has been continued fighting in the east, which has seen the deployment of UN and SADC peacekeepers to support Kinshasa. Read more country profiles

The president won about 73% of the vote, with his nearest challenger, Moise Katumbi, on 18%, officials said. The election was marred by widespread logistical problems. It had to be extended to a second day in some parts of the country. About two-thirds of polling stations opened late, while 30% of voting machines did not work on the first day of the vote, according to an observer group. The opposition said the problems were part of a deliberate plan to allow the results to be rigged in favour of Mr Tshisekedi, 60. Mr Tshisekedi became president in January 2019 after protracted political wrangling in the wake of a controversial election in December 2018. He succeeded Joseph Kabila, who had become president when his own father Laurent was assassinated in 2001. President Tshisekedi also comes from a political dynasty, as his father Étienne was opposition leader and later prime minister under the dictator Mobutu Sese Seko in the 1980s and 1990s. The Congolese media operate against a backdrop of political power struggles and unrest. Reporters Without Borders says journalists face arrest, threats and violence. The press carries criticism of the government, and some publications reflect opposition party views. Radio is the leading medium. Radio Okapi, partly run by the local UN mission, is an influential outlet.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgn1k9nleno,DR Congo rebels vow to march all the way to capital,2025-01-30T19:41:07.731Z,Barbara Plett-Usher & Basillioh Rukanga,"The rebel leader whose fighters have captured Goma, the biggest city in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo, has vowed to continue their offensive all the way to the capital, Kinshasa. Corneille Nangaa, who heads an alliance of rebel groups that includes the M23, said their ultimate aim was to topple President Félix Tshisekedi's government. Unconfirmed reports say the Rwanda-backed rebels are currently advancing towards Bukavu, the second-biggest city in the mineral-rich east, despite international calls for a ceasefire. In a televised address after the fall of Goma, Tshisekedi said a ""vigorous and coordinated response"" was under way to recapture territory from the rebels. ""Be sure of one thing: the Democratic Republic of Congo will not let itself be humiliated or crushed. We will fight and we will triumph,"" he said on Wednesday evening. The fighting has forced about 500,000 people from their homes, worsening an already dire humanitarian crisis, according to the UN. On Thursday, Nangaa presented the rebels as the new administrators of Goma, telling journalists they were there to stay and would get services up and running again. Since fighting escalated last week, electricity and water supplies in the city have been cut off, and food is scarce. ""We will continue the march of liberation all the way to Kinshasa,"" Nangaa added. Analysts say such an offensive would be unlikely given the vast size of the country - Kinshasa is 2,600km (1,600 miles) away. However, it did happen in 1997, when Rwanda-backed forces ousted long-time leader Mobutu Sese Seko. Nangaa's comments will increase anger in Kinshasa, which has accused neighbouring Rwanda of backing the rebels, and even having its troops in Goma. Rwanda is also facing a chorus of international criticism, despite its denials of direct military support. M23 - the main rebel group in the alliance - is led by ethnic Tutsis, and says it took up arms to protect the rights of the minority group in DR Congo. Rwanda's President Paul Kagame is also a Tutsi, and accuses DR Congo's government of harbouring Hutu militias who were involved in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Both the UN and the southern African regional bloc Sadc have peacekeepers in the east, but they failed to halt the rebel assault. Peacekeepers from several counties have been killed in the conflict, with South African troops suffering the highest casualties - 13. On Wednesday, Kagame said Rwanda was ready for a confrontation with South Africa if necessary, following a claim by President Cyril Ramaphosa that M23 fighters and Rwandan forces were responsible for the deaths. In a strongly worded statement on X, Kagame accused Ramaphosa of distorting their private conversations. ""If South Africa wants to contribute to peaceful solutions, that is well and good, but South Africa is in no position to take on the role of a peacemaker or mediator. And if South Africa prefers confrontation, Rwanda will deal with the matter in that context any day,"" he said. The exchange marks a significant escalation in tensions between the two nations, whose relationship has been fragile for several years. Southern African leaders are due to hold a summit on Friday, with Kagame saying their regional force was ""not a peacekeeping force, and it has no place in this situation"". In contrast, Tshisekedi paid tribute to the killed Sadc soldiers ""fighting alongside us"", as well as UN peacekeepers. The UN, the European Union and countries including the US and China have all called on Rwandan forces to leave DR Congo. The UK and Germany are among donor countries that have threatened to withdraw their aid to Rwanda in the wake of the M23 offensive. UK Foreign Secretary David Lammy said on Wednesday that £32m ($40m) of annual bilateral aid was under threat, while Germany has cancelled aid talks with the country.

The victim was a 32-year-old male nurse whose symptoms included ""high fever, chest pain, and difficulty in breathing"" and ""bleeding from multiple body sites"". He died of multi-organ failure on Wednesday at Mulango National Hospital, located in the city's central business district. This marks Uganda's eighth recorded Ebola outbreak since the first infection was documented in 2000. The Sudan Ebola Virus Disease (SUDV) is a highly infectious haemorrhagic fever which is transmitted through contact with infected bodily fluids and tissues. It is one of several strains of the Ebola virus known to cause outbreaks. In the days before his death, the nurse went to multiple health facilities as well as a traditional healer, before the diagnosis was confirmed. He also went to a public hospital in Mbale, a city which borders Kenya. The ministry said 44 contacts of the deceased man, including 30 healthcare workers, have been identified for tracing. Rapid response teams have been deployed to try to contain the disease. But contact tracing may be difficult since Kampala, a bustling city of over four million people, serves as a major hub for travel to South Sudan, Democratic Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and other neighbouring countries. Uganda's last Ebola outbreak was in September 2022, which was also caused by SUDV. Centred in Mubende district, it was declared over after four months. There are six known types of the Ebola virus. Four of them, Zaire, Bundibugyo, Sudan, and Taï Forest, are known to cause disease in humans. The Reston and Bombali strains primarily affect non-human primates. Unlike the more common Zaire Ebola virus, there is no approved vaccine for the Sudan strain. Symptoms of Ebola infection include fever, fatigue, muscle pain, headache, and sore throat, followed by vomiting, diarrhoea, rash, and internal and external bleeding. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that, on average, Ebola kills five in every 10 infected individuals. However, past outbreaks have shown a case fatality rate ranging from 25% to 90%, depending on the circumstances and response measures. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78w1ze7v25o,South Africa and Rwanda go head-to-head over DR Congo war,2025-01-30T16:45:53.767Z,Khanyisile Ngcobo,"South Africa and Rwanda's already fraught diplomatic relations have worsened after President Cyril Ramaphosa accused the Rwanda-backed M23 rebel group of killing South African peacekeepers in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. As the rebels gained the upper hand in the battlefield by capturing most of Goma - the biggest city in the east - South Africa fired a diplomatic salvo, warning that further attacks on its troops would be considered a ""declaration of war"". Rwanda's President Paul Kagame hit back, accusing South Africa of being part of a ""belligerent force"" involved in ""offensive combat operations"" to help the Congolese government ""fight against its own people"". A total of 13 South African soldiers have been killed in the fighting since last week as the rebels made a lightning advance towards Goma - a major trading hub on the border with Rwanda. Last year, another seven South Africans were killed in eastern DR Congo - making it one of the country's deadliest combat-related tragedies in recent times. South Africa and Rwanda have long had a difficult relationship. In 2014, South Africa expelled three Rwandan diplomats after an attack on the home of an exiled Rwandan dissident in Johannesburg. Kagame's government responded by expelling six South African envoys. Tensions seemingly eased after Ramaphosa's visit to Rwanda last year for commemorations to mark the 30th anniversary of the genocide in which about 800,000 people were killed. But they have flared up again, following the death of the South Africans who were deployed to eastern DR Congo in December 2023 as part of a regional peace-keeping force sent by the Southern African Development Community (Sadc). South African soldiers make up the bulk of the force - known by the acronym SAMIDRC - that had the mission of repelling armed groups such as the M23 and bringing peace to the mineral-rich region following decades of unrest. The latest diplomatic fall-out started with a post shared on Ramaphosa's X page. In it, the president confirmed he had spoken to Kagame about the escalating conflict and that both leaders had agreed ""on the urgent need for a ceasefire and the resumption of peace talks by all parties to the conflict"". Ramaphosa also insisted, in a later statement, that the presence of South African troops in DR Congo was not a ""declaration of war against any country or state"" - an apparent reference to Rwanda. South Africa's Defence Minister Angie Motshekga, however, had a slightly different take, telling reporters: ""There's been no hostilities between us, it's just that when they were firing above our heads, the president did warn them [that] if you're going to fire, we're going to take that as a declaration of war."" But Ramaphosa went further on X, saying the peacekeepers were killed in attacks by the M23 and - he pointedly added - ""Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) militia"". This angered Kagame, who said statements made by South African officials - including Ramaphosa - contained lies and distortion. ""The Rwanda Defence Force is an army, not a militia,"" Kagame replied on X. ""President Ramaphosa has never given a 'warning' of any kind, unless it was delivered in his local language which I do not understand. He did ask for support to ensure the South African force has adequate electricity, food and water, which we shall help communicate. ""President Ramaphosa confirmed to me that M23 did not kill the soldiers from South Africa, [the Conglese army] FARDC did,"" Kagame said. He added that the regional peacekeepers - who included troops from Tanzania and Malawi - were a ""belligerent force"" working alongside ""genocidal armed groups"" that targeted Rwanda, and had ""no place in this situation"". Kagame closed his lengthy statement by saying South Africa was in ""no position to take on the role of a peacemaker or mediator"" and if the country wanted a confrontation, Rwanda would ""deal with the matter in that context any day"". Kagame's comments clearly suggested that he wants South Africa to back off from DR Congo, where its military involvement dates back to the late 1990s. It first joined the UN's peacekeeping mission, Monusco, following the end of the racist system of apartheid in 1994. At the time, the South Africa's military had just emerged from being regarded as a ""highly effective apartheid war-time force"" to a ""peacetime force"" left to grapple with reduced funding and a ""lack of political direction"", Thomas Mandrup, an associate professor at the country's Stellenbosch University, told the BBC. While South Africa has said its involvement in DR Congo was guided by its need to ""contribute to the stability"" of a fellow Sadc member, defence analyst Dean Wingrin said the country's economic interests also influenced its decision. ""The DRC is a very big trading partner with [us] because eastern DRC is so rich in minerals. We import a lot of minerals… from the DRC so South Africa has an interest in a peaceful DRC,"" he told the BBC. While Monusco's mission has largely been about peacekeeping, escalating tensions in the region led to the establishment of the Force Intervention Brigade in 2013 to ""actively engage"" with the numerous armed groups in eastern DR Congo. This intervention had initial success in repelling the M23, the most prominent rebel group. This was partly due to the deployment of South Africa's attack aircraft - Rooivalk - which had a ""devastating effect"" on the M23 in a short space of time, according to Mr Wingrin. The rebel group then effectively melted away and was subsequently expelled from eastern DR Congo - until its recent comeback which has seen it capture much of the region. However, South Africa's military has been in no position, this time around, to thwart the rebel group's advance as it has lost its airpower. ""Unfortunately South Africa's budget has continued to decline over the years. The air force couldn't afford to maintain the Rooivalks,"" Mr Wingrin said. ""We're missing that vital aircover that would've come in so handy a few days ago but is way too late now,"" he said. Mr Mandrup expressed a similar view, saying South Africa deployed its troops in 2023, ignoring warnings that ""you haven't got the capabilities needed, the defence force is in shambles and you're facing an opponent that's much better equipped than in 2013"". He added that it was difficult for South Africa to bring back its troops at this point because the ""forces are locked down and caught in two bases"". ""They can't get out, get aircover [or] reinforcements. They can't even get the wounded out,"" he said. Ramaphosa seemed to agree, saying in a recent statement that the situation in the region was ""tense, volatile and unpredictable"". In spite of this, any decision to pull South African troops out of DR Congo ultimately lies with Sadc since SAMIDRC was deployed by the 16-member regional bloc. There are reports that Sadc is set to take this decision at a summit taking place on Friday. For Mr Wingrin, there was a need for the South African government to do ""serious introspection"" over its military involvement in DR Congo. ""Is it something they want to push at all costs and what is it worth to South Africa to have sons and daughters dying so far away?"" he asked. So, South Africa's president appears to have a difficult choice – keep his soldiers in DR Congo and risk further deaths, or the embarrassment of pulling them out, presumably after negotiating safe passage for them with Rwanda.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwyekqn1k1ko,Zuma's daughter faces terrorism charges over South Africa riots,2025-01-30T12:27:28.144Z,,"The daughter of former South African President Jacob Zuma, Duduzile Zuma-Sambudla, has appeared in court on terrorism charges over her alleged involvement in the 2021 riots that left more than 300 people dead. Violence, chaos, and fear ripped through the port city of Durban, then spread to Gauteng, after Zuma's jailing sparked intense protests over four years ago. Zuma-Sambudla, a controversial figure in her own right, was accused of sharing incendiary social media posts that fuelled the civil unrest. The arrest comes as a ""result of a meticulous investigation"" said spokesperson for the Hawks elite police unit, Brig Thandi Mbambo. Zuma-Sambudla handed herself in to Durban Central police station on Thursday morning to face charges under the Protection of Constitutional Democracy against Terrorist and Related Activities Act and incitement to commit violence, police said. National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) spokesperson Mthunzi Mhaga said the investigation had taken such a long time because the case was ""complex"" and ""unique"". ""It is the first time that the NPA is charging a person based on content posted on what we call X, which was previously known as Twitter, for content that we consider to amount to incitement to commit terrorism,"" the News24 site quotes him as saying. Zuma-Sambudla told the court that she intended to plead not guilty to the charges. She also said that there was no evidence linking her to the riots. The case has been postponed to March for trial in the Durban High Court and she has been released on bail. Supporters of her father's party uMkhonto WeSizwe (MK), of which she is a senior member, gathered at the courtroom to rally behind her. Zuma was also present and gave a speech. ""They are now arresting my child because they don't like her, nor do they like her father, or the party that he leads. Are we going to keep quiet?"" he said. He added: ""We are here for nothing. I was also arrested for nothing."" This is not the first time Zuma-Sambudla's name has been brought up in connection to the 2021 riots, which are considered one of the bloodiest episodes in post-apartheid South Africa. Zuma resigned as president in 2018 after nine years in office, plagued by corruption allegations, which he claimed were part of a political conspiracy. He then refused to testify at a judicial inquiry into these allegations and was jailed for contempt of court. Protests erupted after he surrendered to serve his sentence. During the unrest, Zuma-Sambudla was outspoken on X, frequently sharing images of the destruction and chaos, accompanied by the caption: ""KZN, we see you."" She used this phrase often throughout the violence. In a now deleted post, she shared a video of someone firing an automatic rifle at a poster of President Cyril Ramaphosa. Last year, the South African Human Rights Commission (SAHRC) released a report that said the riots were a ""carefully orchestrated event"". But it said it could find no direct link to Zuma's arrest. In 2023, a former security guard was sentenced to 12 years in prison for his role in the deadly riots. He was the first person to be prosecuted for the riots. President Cyril Ramaphosa, who succeeded Jacob Zuma in 2018, described the violence as an ""attempted insurrection"". More than 200 shopping malls were looted and more than 150,000 jobs were estimated to have been lost during the unrest, which lasted for several days. Last year, Zuma's MK ran against his former party, the ANC, in elections, gaining 15% of the vote to become the country's third largest party.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yvd91j72eo,Three military-run states leave West African bloc - what will change?,2025-01-29T18:14:17.256Z,Chris Ewokor,"Three countries under military rule have officially left West African regional bloc Ecowas, after more than a year of diplomatic tensions. The withdrawal of Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger is a huge blow to Ecowas, which at 50 years old is considered Africa's most important regional group. The split was sparked after the three departing countries refused Ecowas demands to restore diplomatic rule. On Wednesday Ecowas said it would keep its ""doors open"" to Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger, even though they have forged ahead with their own bloc, the Alliance of Sahel States (AES by its French acronym). Ecowas - which stands for the Economic Community of West African States - was founded in 1975 in a bid to improve economic and political integration in West Africa. Prior to Wednesday's shake-up, the bloc had 15 members, including states like Nigeria, Ghana, Ivory Coast and Senegal. Citizens of all Ecowas countries currently have the right to live and work in all member states, while goods can circulate freely. Relations between Ecowas and the three Sahel countries have been tense since the military seized power in Niger in 2023, Burkina Faso in 2022 and Mali in 2020. After the Niger coup, Ecowas imposed crippling sanctions on the country, such as border closures, a no-fly zone for all commercial flights and the freezing of central bank assets. Ecowas also threatened to deploy its forces to Niger in order to restore democratic rule. But this hard line merely strengthened the resolve of the three juntas. Mali and Burkina Faso criticised Ecowas' ""inhuman"" sanctions and vowed to defend Niger if the bloc intervened militarily. After being suspended by Ecowas, the three states hit back by giving notice last January that they would withdraw in a year, meeting the timeline set by the bloc for states that decide to leave. Negotiations between Ecowas and the juntas have taken place since then - but have failed. The three countries accuse Ecowas of being too close to Western powers and have instead pivoted towards Russia. According to the departing countries, they will now experience greater sovereignty and also independence from a force that has a foreign agenda. But analysts say Niger, Mali and Burkina Faso may struggle outside the bloc - these are poor and landlocked countries whose economies depend on their West African neighbours. While Ecowas works out the terms of its future relationship with the three countries, it says it will continue to recognise all passports and identity cards bearing the Ecowas logo held by citizens from Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso. The countries will also remain in the bloc's free-trade scheme. Similarly, AES chairman, Mali's military ruler Assimi Goïta, said last January that the right of Ecowas citizens to ""enter, circulate, reside, establish and leave the territory"" of the new bloc would be maintained. Ilyasu Gadu, an international affairs expert and media consultant based in Nigeria's capital Abuja, told the BBC: ""The three junta leaders have taken steps to say: 'Yes, we are pulling out of Ecowas but we want to maintain our relationships. We will not close our borders' because they must have realised that if they do that, they would have shot themselves in the foot."" West Africa observers are also concerned the withdrawal will worsen security in the region. The Sahel - the semi-arid region just south of the Sahara Desert that includes the three departing countries - is wracked with jihadist insurgencies and now accounts for ""almost half of all deaths from terrorism globally"", a senior UN official said in April. Ecowas was supporting Mali, Burkina Faso and Niger in their fight against the jihadists, but this help may now be rescinded, observers fear. Although the juntas now receive weapons and mercenaries from Russia, the militants continue to inflict heavy casualties on both civilians and the armed forces. Ecowas will lose 76 million of its 446 million people and more than half its total geographical land area. There are also concerns the withdrawal will weaken both regional unity and cooperation in combatting insurgencies. The split ""worsens a legitimacy crisis of ECOWAS which has often failed people's expectations in upholding the rule of law,"" Ulf Laessing, head of the Sahel program at the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, told the Associated Press. ""That the three poorest member states decided to leave the bloc makes Ecowas in the eyes of its citizens look even more like a loser in this conflict.""  On Tuesday, some people in the three departing countries' capitals took to the streets to celebrate the withdrawal. But not everyone supports the juntas' decisions. Omar Hama from Niger said he wished the three countries had remained in Ecowas, while simultaneously belonging to the AES. ""I would have liked them to overcome their differences because we have a common space, same people with historical similarities and same economic realities,"" he told the BBC. Fatouma Harber, a journalist and blogger living in Mali, is worried that the change may eventually cause administrative and economic hassles for her and other citizens of the three countries. ""However, if the Alliance of Sahel States (AES) can really bring benefits for us, that would be an excellent thing,"" she said. Zabeirou Issa, who lives in Mali's capital Bamako, took a firmer stance, saying: ""Ecowas does not have any power, it is the Westerners who decide for the Ecowas leaders. Yes, I am very happy about the decision."" In Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso's capital, Cisse Kabore told the BBC she wanted her country to remain in Ecowas because now the region ""will no longer be united as before"". Last month, Ecowas said it would give Niger, Burkina Faso and Mali a six-month grace period for them to reconsider their withdrawal. However, at a press conference on Wednesday, Ecowas Commission head Omar Alieu Touray said: ""Any state can decide to come back in the community at any time."" To consolidate their exit from Ecowas and strenghten their alliance, the three countries said they would begin circulating new AES passports on Wednesday. They have also decided to join forces to create a 5,000-strong military unit to fight the jihadist violence that has plagued the nations for years.

The plane, which was heading to the capital, Juba, crashed three minutes after take-near the oil fields in Unity State on Wednesday morning, said Petroleum Minister Puot Kang Chol. Among the victims are five foreign nationals: two Chinese, one Indian, and two Ugandan crew members. The 15 other victims were all South Sudanese. The cause of the crash has not been determined, but authorities said they are investigating. ""Our thoughts and condolences go out to the families and loved ones of those on board during this incredibly difficult time,"" said Chol. The oil workers, who were all men, worked for the Greater Pioneer Company (GPOC) and the plane was operated by Light Air Services Aviation Company. GPOC is a joint venture that includes state-owned oil companies from India, China, Malaysia, and South Sudan. It was meant to be a routine exploration mission. South Sudan's aviation infrastructure is not well developed and the country has a poor safety record. Air accidents are common, and frequently blamed on overloading of the aircraft or the weather conditions.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd0j4d7v229o,Congolese president snubs peace talks over Goma crisis,2025-01-29T17:15:08.472Z,"Farouk Chothia, Basillioh Rukanga & Ian Wafula","The Democratic Republic of Congo's President Félix Tshisekedi is not taking part in regionally brokered talks aimed at ending the rebel assault on the key eastern city of Goma, state media has reported. Kenyan leader William Ruto had invited Tshisekedi and his Rwandan counterpart Paul Kagame to a virtual summit, as corpses lay on the streets of Goma following heavy fighting. Neighbouring Rwanda is accused of backing the M23 rebel group, which has taken over much of the city, including its airport. About 280 Romanian mercenaries who were fighting on the side of DR Congo's army had surrendered to M23, the Rwanda Defence Force (RDF) said on X. Rwandan government spokeswoman Yolande Makolo told the BBC that Rwanda would take part in the summit, but did not say whether Kagame would attend. The UN says there is extensive evidence that Rwanda is backing the M23 but Rwanda denies giving the rebels direct military support. Goma was mostly quiet on Wednesday, with reports of sporadic gunfire in some districts. Residents who had been hiding in safe areas ventured out to buy food that is becoming increasingly scarce following days of fighting. Both the UN and the southern African regional bloc SADC have peacekeepers in Goma, but they failed to halt the rebel assault. Speaking to BBC Newshour while being locked down in a UN bunker in the city, the deputy head of the UN force, Vivian van de Perre, said the M23 rebels had ""established"" themselves in Goma, but were still facing ""pockets of resistance"". She added that after she held talks with the M23, UN peacekeepers were starting to move around, which was ""extremely urgent because some of our bases had run out of food and water and are literally sheltering thousands of people"" - including some government soldiers who had surrendered. In an apparent attempt to extend their territorial control, M23 rebels are now advancing towards Bukavu, eastern DR Congo's second biggest city, Reuters news agency quotes five diplomatic and security sources as saying. The BBC has not been able to verify this information. DR Congo's official news agency said that Tshisekedi would not attend the heads of state summit called by Kenya's leader in his capacity as chairman of the East African Community (EAC). It did not give a reason for his decision. Ms van de Perre said she hoped that the fighting would not worsen ethnic tensions. ""We have seen some evidence of ethnic tensions being on the rise and this is everybody's worst nightmare,"" she told the BBC. The M23 are led by ethnic Tutsis, who say they needed to take up arms to protect the rights of the minority group in DR Congo. Rwanda's leader is also a Tutsi, and accuses DR Congo's government of harbouring Hutu militias who were involved in the 1994 genocide in Rwanda. Since the beginning of the week, clashes between M23 rebels and the army and its allies left hospitals overwhelmed by casualties and bodies on the streets, according to the UN. Warehouses with food and medical supplies were also looted, aid agencies said. Essential services have been unavailable since the offensive began, with electricity, water and internet cut. Growing anger over the rebel offensive led to protesters targeting foreign embassies in the capital, Kinshasa. At least 10 embassies were damaged and looted by protesters who demanded that the international community intervene to end the rebel assault, as they tightened their grip on Goma. Rwanda's military said the Romanian mercenaries were being transported to Rwanda's capital, Kigali, after they had ""surrendered to M23 following the capture of the strategic city"". But a UN peacekeeper told the BBC that the Romanians had sought refuge at a UN base in Goma, and were then evacuated to Rwanda. The coordinator of the group, Constantin Timofti, told Romanian news channel TVR that four of his men were wounded in the clashes but were in a stable condition. Romania's foreign ministry said on Tuesday that the group numbered more than 250, and were private contractors working for the DR Congo government as part of a military training mission. Dozens of them were seen on Wednesday in Gisenyi, just across the Rwandan border from Goma, being searched by officers. ""We weren't on a battlefield. We were here to train and help with artillery,"" one, who only gave the name Emile, told AFP news agency. ""What I learned is that anything can happen. I came. I did my work and now I am happy to go back and be with my family,"" he added. In 2022, DR Congo's government signed contracts with two private military companies to bolster its forces against the rebels. The Romanian personnel had played a crucial role in securing key installations, including the airport, and had manned checkpoints on the outskirts of Goma, until the latest rebel assault. DR Congo's government accuses Rwanda of backing the rebels to exploit the region's mineral wealth, an accusation Kagame's government denies. The region is rich in minerals such as gold and coltan, a key ingredient in making mobile phones and batteries for electric vehicles. Go to BBCAfrica.com for more news from the African continent.

The move is a major blow to the Venezuelan government as the licence provided it, through joint ventures between the state-run oil company and US oil giant Chevron, with a crucial income in dollars. Trump said he was revoking the licence - which gave Chevron permission to operate in Venezuela - because the government of Nicolás Maduro had failed to meet ""electoral conditions"" and had not transported ""violent criminals"" deported from the US at a quick enough pace. Venezuela called the decision ""damaging"" and said it could increase migration to the US. Trump made the announcement on Truth Social, writing that he was ""hereby reversing the concessions that Crooked Joe Biden gave to Nicolás Maduro, of Venezuela, on the oil transaction agreement, dated November 26, 2022"". He did not clarify which concessions he was referring to, but the only licence related to Venezuela granted that day was the one issued by the US treasury authorising Chevron to ""resume limited natural resource extraction operations in Venezuela"". The licence allowed Chevron to operate joint ventures with Venezuela's state-controlled oil company PDVSA, but barred the US company from paying ""any taxes or royalties to the Government of Venezuela"". Chevron's spokesman Bill Turenne said in a statement on Wednesday that ""Chevron conducts its business in Venezuela in compliance with all laws and regulations, including the sanctions framework provided by US government"". In a recent interview with the Financial Times newspaper, Chevron Chief Executive Mike Wirth argued that if Chevron was forced to pull out of Venezuela, it would allow companies from China and Russia to increase their presence and influence there. He also warned that Venezuela's economy could suffer more if Chevron left the country, which could drive further migration to the US. The Venezuelan opposition, on the other hand, has in the past argued for the licence to be revoked, arguing that it provides the Maduro government with ""a financial lifeline"". The licence was granted in 2022 by the Biden Administration in an attempt to entice the Maduro government to allow free and fair elections. It remained in place even after Venezuela's government-aligned electoral council declared Maduro the winner of the presidential election in July 2024 - a result which has been refuted by the opposition and by a number of countries, including the US, which have recognised Maduro's rival as the legitimate winner instead. President Trump's announcement came less than a month after his envoy, Richard Grenell, met with Nicolás Maduro in Caracas. During his visit, Grenell secured the release of six US citizens who had been held in Venezuela, as well as a deal under which the Maduro government sent planes to the US to fetch deported Venezuelans. In his Truth Social post, Trump said ""the regime has not been transporting the violent criminals that they sent into our Country (the Good Ole' U.S.A.) back to Venezuela at the rapid pace that they had agreed to"". He added he was ""therefore ordering that the ineffective and unmet Biden 'Concession Agreement' be terminated"" as of 1 March. Venezuelan Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez warned that US sanctions had in the past led to an increase of Venezuelans migrating to the US and that this was likely to happen again. Stopping undocumented migration has been one of Trump's main priorities since taking office. The announcement had a swift effect on oil prices, which rose more than 1% on Thursday."

In the capital, Santiago, the entire underground train system was suspended almost immediately. Thousands of people had to be evacuated and stations were plunged into darkness. ""We were like sardines in the dark,"" one passenger described the moment their underground train stalled. Many of those who had been in lifts inside the stations when the power cut happened had to be freed by firefighters. One woman in her 70s was trapped in a lift between two floors in a building in Santiago. She told local media that she had ""kicked the door"" of the lift to draw attention to her plight and her screams eventually alerted the concierge. ""I'm brave, I told myself 'I'm not going to die here',"" she said. Videos shared on social media also showed metro passengers using their mobile phones' flashlights to find their way out of dark stations. According to Metro de Santiago, the evacuation of the underground was completed 90 minutes after the power cut - but disruption caused by the outage carried on for many more hours. The 150 extra buses deployed to ferry passengers were not nearly enough to make up for the suspension of the metro, which transports an average of 2.3m passengers every day. Long queues formed at bus stops, where passengers grew increasingly angry when packed buses did not stop. Their numbers soon swelled with workers sent home early because most offices were paralysed by the lack of electricity. ""The power went out at 3:00pm, so we had no power at all,"" one shopkeeper in Santiago said. ""People started closing up at around 4 or 5pm."" Traffic in the capital was further disrupted by the failure of several traffic lights. A truck collided with a car at one crossing where the traffic lights were out and there were reports of at least one other accident also caused by the lack of functioning traffic lights. With the gridlock getting worse, thousands of people were forced to walk to their destinations in summer temperatures of around 30 Celsius (86 Fahrenheit). One of them, Sharon Ortiz, a 28-year-old waitress, told AFP news agency that the public transport system had ""collapsed"". ""I got to work two hours late, I got stuck in the middle of the Costanera [shopping centre] and from there I had to walk,"" she said. Some people hitched lifts on the back of trucks. Restaurants and cafes were among the businesses affected by the power cut. Some remained open to offer those walking home a place to rest, but many closed because cash machines, card machines and fridges were not working. Some of the most dramatic scenes unfolded in Fantasilandia, an amusement park in Santiago, where at least a dozen people were stuck on top of a rollercoaster. Fantasilandia's manager said that while the park had backup generators, the attractions would not immediately restart for security reasons. Hospitals relied on emergency generators for power. As the sun set, the government declared a state of emergency and imposed a curfew from 22:00 to 06:00 local time. Soldiers and police were deployed to maintain order. Some Chileans tried to see a positive in the power cut - with several posting photos of the night sky on social media, pointing out that the lack of light pollution had made the milky way easier to see."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crmj7vkyr78o,Chile power cut leaves millions without electricity,2025-02-25T20:38:54.195Z,Alex Boyd,"Media reports say some power has been restored in parts of Chile's capital, Santiago, after a near-nationwide cut left huge swathes of the country without electricity. A state of emergency was declared, with a curfew in affected areas, where soldiers have been deployed. The Viña del Mar festival, the largest music event in Latin America, has had its third day cancelled. Hospitals and prisons across the country are on emergency generators and transport is severely disrupted. The government blamed a system failure. Addressing the nation on TV, President Gabriel Boric said eight million homes had been affected, but power had been restored to about half of them. ""What happened today is outrageous,"" he said. ""It's intolerable that one or several companies should affect the everyday life of millions of Chileans, and that's why it's the state's duty to hold them responsible."" Read: 'We were trapped like sardines in the dark' The national service for disaster prevention and response said earlier that the outage stretched from the regions of Arica and Parinacota in the north to Los Lagos in the south. Reuters news agency reported that the world's largest copper mine, Escondida, was without power, citing a source close to the matter. Latam Airlines said some of its flights might also be disrupted while power supplies were down, and urged passengers to check their journey status. In a post on X, the Santiago Metro operator said its service had been temporarily suspended because of the power outage, with stations being evacuated and closed. Footage from the city showed passengers being evacuated from stations by walking up switched-off escalators, while traffic signals were also shown not working. There were also long queues for buses which were still running on the city's roads. María Angélica Román, 45, told AFP news agency: ""They let us leave work because of the power cut, but now I don't know how we will get home, because all the buses are full."" Chile's Interior Minister, Carolina Tohá, also posted on X to say that a meeting would be called to discuss the continuing measures to restore services."

Reinaldo Araujo, a leader of the Vente Venezuela party in Trujillo state, had been suffering from health problems, which his wife said were not treated while he was in prison. Vente Venezuela's leader, María Corina Machado, said she held ""the regime"" of Nicolás Maduro responsible for Araujo's death. According to the Venezuelan Prison Observatory NGO, 20 political prisoners have died while in custody over the past few years. Vente Venezuela said Araujo had been seized by masked men on 9 January during a protest on the eve of the swearing in of Nicolás Maduro for a third term as president. His wife said he had been returning from a medical appointment and had merely been observing the protest when he was taken away. He had been in state custody since then. Read: Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life His wife accuses the authorities of failing to providing her husband with medical care until it was too late, even though she had warned them that his health had been deteriorating. The head of the regional body Organization of American States (OAS), Luis Almagro, denounced Araujo's death, writing on X that it was a ""new atrocity of the regime"". He added: ""No more political prisoners, no more torture, no more death."" Almagro has been an outspoken critic of Nicolás Maduro, accusing the Venezuelan leader of repressing the opposition in the run-up and the aftermath of July's presidential election. Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE), a body closely aligned with the government, declared Maduro the winner of the election without providing detailed voting tallies to back up their claim. The OAS's electoral observation department said it could not recognise the result because the CNE ""was biased towards the government"". Venezuela's opposition coalition also refused to recognise the result, saying that voting tallies it had gathered, with the help of official election observers, showed that its candidate, Edmundo González, was the overwhelming winner. The opposition also organised protests on the eve of Maduro's swearing in and it was at one such event that Reinaldo Araujo was seized. According to the Venezuelan Prison Observatory, hundreds of protesters were arrested in the days leading up to Maduro's inauguration and sent to jails notorious for the mistreatment of detainees. Among those seized was Rafael Tudares, the son-in-law of Edmundo González. Mr Tudares's wife says she has not been given any information about her husband's whereabouts since he was taken away by the security forces on 7 January. She also accused the government of holding her husband in order to exert pressure on Edmundo González, who is living in exile and has been meeting presidents across the region, many of whom have recognised him as the legitimate leader of Venezuela."

José Ángel Canobbio, also known as ""El Güerito"" (little blond one), is accused of being the right hand man of Iván Archivaldo Guzmán, one of the sons of infamous jailed drug lord Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán. Mexican security forces say the arrest of Canobbio, who they say was in charge of security for Iván Archivaldo Guzmán, is a severe blow to the Sinaloa cartel. He was captured just hours after the United States added the Sinaloa cartel to its list of foreign terrorist organisations (FTOs), a move which the Trump Administration says will allow it to better combat the criminal groups. As well as the Sinaloa cartel, the US state department designated seven other Latin American crime groups as FTOs. They are: All but the last two groups are based in Mexico and the Mexican government has come under huge pressure by the Trump Administration to step up its fight against them and the trafficking of the synthetic drug fentanyl they engage in. Read more about how fentanyl gets into the US Earlier this month, Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum managed to convince her US counterpart to hold off imposing a 25% duty on Mexican imports to the US for a month. Mexican security forces will hope that the arrest of Canobbio - who was indicted in absentia by a federal grand jury in Chicago in November for allegedly smuggling fentanyl into the US - will go some way towards showing their commitment to the fight against drug trafficking. The indictment accuses Canobbio of being the principal advisor, lieutenant and security chief for Iván Archivaldo Guzmán, one of the sons of Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán who took over the running of the Sinaloa cartel after their father was jailed. According to security expert David Saucedo, Canobbio has played a key role in getting the Sinaloa cartel involved in the smuggling of fentanyl to the US. Mr Saucedo told Mexico's Radio Formula, that he expected him to be quickly extradited to the US."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgw3l7p79po,Fog harvesting could provide water for arid cities,2025-02-20T05:13:30.623Z,Victoria Gill,"Capturing water from fog - on a large scale - could provide some of the driest cities in the world with drinking water. This is what researchers in Chile have concluded after studying the potential of fog harvesting in the desert city of Alto Hospicio in the north of the country. Average rainfall in the region is less than 0.19in (5mm) per year. ""Like a lot of cities, Alto Hospicio has its social problems,"" said lead researcher Dr Virginia Carter Gamberini, from Universidad Mayor. ""There is a lot of poverty"", she explained, and many people there have no direct access to the networks that supply clean water. Many who live in the city's poorest communities rely on drinking water that is delivered by truck. However, clouds of fog that regularly gather over the mountain city are an untapped source, researchers say. Capturing fog water is remarkably simple - a mesh is hung between poles, and when the moisture-laden clouds pass through that fine mesh, droplets form. The water is then channelled into pipes and storage tanks. It has been used at a small scale for several decades, mainly in rural South and Central America - in places with the right foggy conditions. One of the biggest fog water harvesting systems is in Morocco, on the edge of the Sahara Desert. However, Dr Carter says a ""new era"" of much larger-scale fog harvesting could provide a more secure and sustainable supply of water in urban environments where it is most needed. She and her colleagues carried out assessments of how much water can be produced by fog harvesting, and combined that information with studies of cloud formation in satellite images and with weather forecasts. From this, they concluded that the clouds that regularly form over the Pacific - and are blown across the coastal mountain city - could provide the people of Alto Hospicio's slums with a sustainable source of drinking water. They published their findings in a paper in the journal Frontiers of Environmental Science. Alto Hospicio's fog forms over the Pacific Ocean - when warm, moist air flows over cold water - and is then blown over the mountains. The reliably foggy conditions here allowed Dr Carter and her colleagues to pinpoint areas where the largest volumes of water could be harvested regularly from the clouds. Based on an annual average water collection rate of 2.5 litres per square metre of mesh per day, the researchers worked out: Alto Hospicio is on the edge of the Atacama Desert - one of the driest places on Earth. With little to no precipitation, the main water source of cities in the region are underground aquifers - rock layers that contain water-filled spaces - that were last refilled thousands of years ago. With urban populations growing, and demand on those water supplies from mining and industry, the scientists say there is an urgent need for other sustainable sources of clean water. Dr Gamberini explained that Chile is ""very special"" for its sea fog, ""because we have the ocean along the whole country and we have the mountains"". Her team is currently working on a ""fog harvesting map"" of the whole country. ""Water from the clouds"", as Dr Carter describes it, could, she said, ""enhance our cities' resilience to climate change, while improving access to clean water"".

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cwydxnxnxpgo,Brazil prosecutor charges ex-President Bolsonaro over alleged coup plot,2025-02-19T13:47:09.698Z,Vanessa Buschschlüter and George Wright Leonardo Rocha,"Brazil's chief prosecutor has accused former President Jair Bolsonaro of leading an attempted coup after the ex-leader was defeated by his left-wing rival in the 2022 presidential election. According to the prosecutor, the alleged plot aimed to prevent Bolsonaro's successor in office, President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, from taking office and included a plan to poison Lula. Bolsonaro, 69, denies any wrongdoing and says he is the victim of a political witch hunt. It is now up to Brazil's Supreme Court to decide whether to accept the prosecutor's charges and put Bolsonaro and 33 others accused on trial.  In a sign of how divided Brazil remains two-and-a-half years after the bitterly fought presidential election, critics of Bolsonaro celebrated news of the charges, saying that the former president belonged in jail, while his supporters insisted he was innocent. The focus is now on Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes, who will have to weigh up the merits of the accusations made by the chief prosecutor and decide whether the case should proceed to the trial stage. There is no deadline for Mr Moraes to make his decision, but legal experts quoted in Brazilian media said they expected him to rule in favour of a trial, which could get under way later this year. Political analysts say a potential trial could have an impact on the 2026 presidential election. While Bolsonaro is barred from running for office until 2030 for falsely claiming that Brazil's voting system was vulnerable to fraud, he remains a strong political force. Many think he could use a potential trial as a platform for his agenda. In his 272-page report, Attorney-General Paulo Gonet said that he had concluded that Bolsonaro and the 33 other accused had formed a criminal group which had tried to instigate a coup against Lula's newly elected government - an allegation those named have denied. The document alleges that Bolsonaro and his vice-presidential candidate Walter Braga Netto led the group. ""Allied with other individuals, including civilians and military personnel, they attempted to prevent, in a co-ordinated manner, the result of the 2022 presidential elections from being fulfilled,"" it reads. According to the report, the alleged plot included a plan to poison Lula and shoot dead Alexandre de Moraes - the same Supreme Court justice now tasked with deciding whether the case should proceed to trial. The prosecutor's charges are based on a police investigation into the events leading up to 8 January 2023, when Bolsonaro supporters stormed government buildings in the capital, Brasilia. Parts of the buildings were ransacked and police arrested 1,500 people. Bolsonaro was in the United States at the time and has always denied any links to the rioters. But the prosecutor's report alleges that he started sowing doubts about Brazil's voting system as early as July 2021, which are thought to have encouraged those storming Congress. Lawyers representing the former president said they were ""astonished"" by the accusations levelled against their client and insisted that he had never supported any movement aimed at dismantling Brazil's democratic rule of law or the institutions that uphold it. The said the prosecutor had come up with a ""fanciful narrative"" that would not stand up to legal scrutiny.  "
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gexj8ll31o,British journalist Charlotte Peet reported missing in Brazil,2025-02-19T11:57:16.739Z,Rachel Hagan,"A British journalist has been reported missing in Brazil, prompting concerns from an association of foreign correspondents which has urged authorities to step up search efforts. Charlotte Peet, 32, is understood to have last contacted a friend on 8 February, saying she was in São Paulo and planned to travel to Rio de Janeiro. She has not been heard from since. Days later, her UK-based family told the friend they had lost contact with her. They have provided authorities with details of her flight and a copy of her passport to aid the search. The Association of Foreign Press Correspondents in Brazil (ACIE) released a statement ""expressing concern over her disappearance and solidarity with her family and friends"". According to the statement, someone initially reported the case to police in Rio before it was transferred to São Paulo, where she was last seen. The statement also added that Brazil's Department of Homicides and Personal Protection (DHPP) was assisting in the case. According to her LinkedIn profile, Ms Peet has worked as a freelance journalist in Rio and London for outlets including Al Jazeera and the Times. ""Her disappearance has sparked growing concern among colleagues and journalists in the region, with ACIE calling for intensified efforts to locate her as soon as possible"", a statement on behalf of its president Edmar Figueiredo and its board of directors said. A UK Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""We are supporting the family of a British woman who has been reported as missing in Brazil and are in contact with the local authorities."""

The vehicle plunged almost 800m (2625 ft) into a ravine in the southwestern district of Yocalla, an officer said. Fourteen people were also injured, including four children, an official from a local hospital said in a video. Bolivia has notoriously dangerous roads, particularly in mountainous areas. The accident happened between the cities of Potosí and Oruro, police said. Officials believe that the crash could have been caused by speeding, with the driver ""unable"" to control the bus, police colonel Victor Benavides told the AFP news agency. This is believed to be the most serious road accident reported in the South American country so far this year. Local news outlet Unitel reported that several of those injured were in a serious condition. Deadly road accidents are common in Bolivia. Last month, 19 people were killed when another bus came off a road, also near Potosí. Road accidents kill an average of 1,400 people every year in the country of about 12 million inhabitants, according to government data."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr4643ddzgqo,Mexican army seizes tonnes of crystal meth,2025-02-17T13:25:04.219Z,Vanessa Buschschlüter,"The Mexican army says it has seized more than four tonnes of methamphetamine in raids conducted in the violence-wracked state of Sinaloa over the weekend. Soldiers raided warehouses and drug labs in Higueras de Abuya, a village about 75km (45 miles) south of the state capital, Culiacán. A spokesman for the army said the seizure of such a large amount of the synthetic drug - which in some forms is known by its street name crystal meth - would constitute a hard blow to whichever criminal gang was behind the labs. Mexico's security minister has deployed thousands of troops to the northern state of Sinaloa an effort to reign in the drug cartels that are active there. The seizure of the powerful and highly addictive stimulant comes just two weeks after Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum managed to convince US President Donald Trump to hold off imposing a 25% duty on Mexican imports to the US for a month. One of the reasons Trump had cited for imposing the tariffs was the flow of drugs from Mexico to the US. He also accused the Mexican government of having ""an intolerable alliance"" with drug trafficking organisations. While the deployment of some extra troops to Sinaloa predates the spat between the US and Mexico over tariffs, the seizure of the methamphetamine stash will be welcome news to the Mexican government, which wants to demonstrate to the US that it is playing its part in trying to combat drug cartels. Hamlet Toledo, deputy operative chief of the army general staff, told reporters that in addition to the four tonnes of methamphetamine seized this weekend, the army had also secured another large meth stash last week, bringing the total to more than five tonnes. General Toledo said that one of the warehouses where the drugs were found appeared to have housed between 15 and 20 people, who are thought to have fled before the soldiers arrived. The soldiers who located the labs had become suspicious when they spotted vats of precursor chemicals - needed to make the drug - outside the properties."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgxdpwqwqpo,Raisins or not? Pudding debate splits island nation,2025-02-16T01:57:36.596Z,Gemma Handy,"It is not cricket or politics that triggers the most ardent debate in Antigua and Barbuda. It is the ingredients of a beloved national dish. The question of whether ""ducana"" – a sweet potato and coconut dumpling – should or should not contain raisins has divided local residents for decades. The piquant pudding is one of many foods widely eaten in the Caribbean country that has its origins in Africa and has survived to this day. And its inclusion in a national inventory of cultural heritage currently being created looks set to reignite the jocular dispute. Antigua and Barbuda's traditional food is just one aspect of the work under way to preserve the twin isles' distinct features for posterity. The inventory will also include its unique dialect, bush medicine, games, crafts, architecture and boat-building techniques. The mammoth venture, being funded by the United Nations cultural body, Unesco, follows concerns that key elements of the country's cultural identity are being lost, explains project leader Dr Hazra Medica. ""There is no longer the traditional transmission of knowledge from older to younger people,"" she tells the BBC. ""Without that, we start to lose the sense of who we are. Outside influences can dilute indigenous culture and people fear that what is peculiarly Antiguan will be lost."" More than two dozen specially trained data collectors have been tasked with interviewing residents from each parish, gathering stories, photos and information. The results will be meticulously entered into a publicly accessible database. Local author Joy Lawrence needed little encouragement to take part. The former schoolteacher's books focus heavily on the country's Creole/English dialect that weaves in many African words from Antiguans' ancestors. English may be the main language but patois, spoken at accelerated speed, is ubiquitous and routinely used to show kinship and camaraderie. ""When the British brought Africans here, they could not speak English and the British could not speak African languages. Because the Africans came from all over and spoke different languages, they could not even converse among themselves for the most part,"" Ms Lawrence says. ""To communicate, the Africans borrowed some vocabulary from the British and incorporated their own pronunciation and syntax to form a pidgin thing. Over the generations, it became perfected and developed structure and grammar."" A couple of generations ago, Antiguan dialect was sneered at and children were commonly forbidden to speak it in school. There are still some who look down their nose at it today, Ms Lawrence scoffs. ""Our forebears worked hard to coin that language,"" she asserts. ""It's our first language; how can we not preserve what's ours? It's not a written language and we spell it any old how, but it has rhythm and I'm proud of it."" The dialect is characterised by an ""economy of words"" and sparse pronouns, she continues. ""We don't waste time to say 'not at all'; we just say 'tarl'. Instead of 'come here', we say 'cumyah'. And we never say her or him; it's always she or he."" In places such as school and church, dialect is used for ""emphasis, clarity and reinforcement"". ""Because we think in it,"" Ms Lawrence adds. Disagreements over the ""correct"" way of doing something is one reason for the decline of some cultural practices, Dr Medica believes. Varying methods of stirring ""fungee"", a cornmeal paste which also hails from the mother continent, and precisely what to add to it is another subject of friendly bickering. ""There's this idea that this is how it's done and should always be done. Sometimes younger people are turned off by not doing it 'right'. ""In the workshops, we saw the 'fungee war'. Antiguans say it should have okra in it, while Barbudans add peas, which made some gasp in shock,"" Dr Medica smiles. Novella Payne – who produces a range of teas, sauces and seasonings under her ""Granma Aki"" brand – learnt everything she knows from her mother and grandmother, but adds her ""own twist"" to time-honoured recipes. ""The seasoning is what sets Antiguan food apart – garlic, onion, thyme and seasoning peppers,"" she explains. Many of Ms Payne's creations feature local medicinal plants, long used to treat everything from coughs and fever to rashes and nausea. Soursop, lemongrass, noni and moringa regularly appear in her syrups and juices. ""Our food is delicious, nutritious and should be preserved because it's part of our culture and heritage,"" she adds. The project recently got under way in Antigua's sister isle, Barbuda, where Dwight Benjamin is striving to keep the art of traditional broom-making alive. Mr Benjamin uses palm leaves, which must be sun-dried for two days, to create the bristles before weaving them on to a stick crafted from a bay tree. The techniques were passed on to him by his grandfather and Mr Benjamin, an accountant by profession, is one of few people still making and selling the brooms. He says they remain in high demand among Barbuda's residents. ""I may be biased, but I find them more effective than store-bought brooms - you feel the difference when you use them. They cover more ground too,"" he says. ""It's not widely practised anymore, but it's something we should cherish and document. I'm hoping my son will pick it up."" For Dr Medica, the project has deeper significance still. ""When we talk about culture in Caribbean islands, we tend to forget the engagement with our colonial past and the impact of that. We're told that our history began when Africans were brought here, projecting this notion that we came as empty vessels with no memory,"" she says. ""The great thing about this work is the huge evidence of African cultural retention. As a people we can claim, 'This is us.' ""In dialect, when someone treats you unfairly, we say 'me smaddy [somebody] too',"" she adds. ""And that's what this whole project is; it's a claim to personhood."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly50k8zypmo,'I felt a slimy texture brush my face': Man describes being swallowed by whale,2025-02-14T16:40:38.278Z,Andrea Díaz & Ayelén Oliva,"The first thing kayaker Adrián Simancas noticed after he was eaten by a whale was the slime. ""I spent a second realising I was inside the mouth of something, that maybe it had eaten me, that it could have been an orca or a sea monster,"" the 23-year-old told BBC Mundo. Adrián had started to think how he might survive inside the humpback whale ""like Pinocchio"" - then the creature spat him back out. The Venezuelan kayaker had been paddling through the Strait of Magellan, off Chile's Patagonian coast, with his father when he felt something ""hit me from behind, closing in on me and sinking me"". His father, Dell, was able to capture the short-lived ordeal on video just metres away. ""I closed my eyes, and when I opened them again, I realised I was inside the whale's mouth,"" Adrián told the BBC. ""I felt a slimy texture brush my face,"" he recalled, adding that all he could see was dark blue and white. ""I wondered what I could do if it had swallowed me since I could no longer fight to stop it,"" he said. ""I had to think about what to do next."" But within seconds, Adrián started to feel as though he was rising toward the surface. ""I was a little afraid of whether I would be able to hold my breath because I didn't know how deep I was, and I felt like it took me a long time to come up. ""I went up for two seconds, and finally I got to the surface and realised that it hadn't eaten me."" In a nearby kayak, Adrián's father Dell Simancas watched on in disbelief. The pair had just crossed Eagle Bay - down the coast from Punta Arenas, Chile's southernmost city - when he heard a crash behind him. ""When I turned around, I didn't see Adrián."" ""I was worried for a second, until I saw him coming up out of the sea,"" the 49-year-old said. ""Then I saw something, a body, which I immediately interpreted as most likely being a whale because of its size."" Dell had fixed a camera to the back of his kayak to record the rising waves - which captured his son's remarkable experience. Watching the footage back, Adrián - who moved with his father to Chile from Venezuela seven years ago in search of a better quality of life - was shocked to see just how enormous the whale had been. ""I hadn't seen the moment when the back appears, and the fin is visible. I didn't see it, I heard it. That made me nervous,"" he said. ""But later, with the video, I realised that it actually appeared before me in such a huge size that perhaps if I had seen it, it would have scared me even more."" For Adrián, the experience was not just about survival - but he said felt he had received a ""second chance"" when the whale spat him out. The ""unique"" experience in one of the most extreme places on Earth had ""invited me to reflect on what I could have done better up until that point, and on the ways I can take advantage of the experience and appreciate it as well"", he added. But there is a simple reason he was able to escape the whale so quickly, according to a wildlife expert. Humpback whales have narrow throats ""about the size of a household pipe"" designed for swallowing small fish and shrimp, Brazilian conservationist Roched Jacobson Seba told the BBC. ""They physically cannot swallow large objects like kayaks, tires, or even big fish like tuna,"" he said. ""Ultimately, the whale spit out the kayak because it was physically impossible to swallow."" The humpback whale likely engulfed Adrián by accident, Mr Seba suggested. ""The whale was likely feeding on a school of fish when it unintentionally scooped up the kayak along with its meal. ""When whales surface too quickly while feeding, they can accidentally hit or engulf objects in their path."" He warned that the encounter served as ""an important reminder"" to avoid using paddleboards, surfboards or other silent vessels in areas where whales usually swim. Boats used for whale watching and research must always keep their engines on, he added, as the noise helps whales detect their presence. Additional reporting by Luis Barrucho and Maia Davies."

Deise Moura dos Anjos, 42, had been in pre-trial detention since January after prosecutors accused her of the murder on Christmas Eve of three relatives and the attempted murder of another three. The victims had all eaten from the cake, which forensic experts found had been baked with flour contaminated with the deadly poison. Police were also investigating if she may have killed her father-in-law, who died in September. Forensic experts who exhumed his body found high levels of arsenic, which led them to believe that he, too, had been poisoned. Moura dos Anjos denied any wrongdoing but local police chief Cléber dos Santos Lima told reporters last month that he was ""certain that she researched, bought (...) and used the poison to kill her victims"". He added that police had found evidence showing that she had bought arsenic on four separate occasions. Investigators tested many food items in the home of Moura dos Anjos's mother-in-law, where the six victims were taken ill, in order to find the source of the poisoning. Eventually, they found sky-high levels or arsenic in the flour - some of which Moura dos Anjos's mother-in-law, Zeli dos Anjos, had used to bake the Christmas cake. As Zeli dos Anjos had herself eaten from the cake and was taken seriously ill, police quickly ruled her out as a suspect even though she had prepared the cake. Zeli dos Anjos survived but two of her sisters and one of her nieces died. Her 10-year-old grandson and the husband of one of her sisters were also among those poisoned but recovered. "

Forty people were treated for smoke inhalation and several others were admitted to hospital before the blaze was controlled. The cause of the fire is not yet known. The 50-floor building is located in the exclusive neighbourhood of Puerto Madero. Alberto Crescenti, head of Buenos Aires emergency services, told local media the fire had ""extended all the way to the 15th floor"". Broken glass fell from the windows, he said. ""Luckily, it was a very fast evacuation, meaning people are not at risk,"" he added. Firefighter Christian Benitez told AFP news agency all the residents were out of danger. ""I heard the fire alarm and came downstairs as quickly as I could,"" Ornella Gril, 30, told AFP outside the building. Mariano Pavone, an ex-footballer who played for Argentine giants River Plate and Spanish club Real Betis, who lives in the building, told Noticias Argentinas news agency: ""I saw smoke and went down with my son and my dog. ""Luckily nothing happened to my flat. I'm anxious for my neighbours. Luckily it was just a scare."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8d9ndjypv9o,Guatemala police investigate bus crash which killed 55,2025-02-11T11:33:06.048Z,Vanessa Buschschlüter,"Police in Guatemala are investigating what could have caused a passenger bus to crash through a guardrail and tumble into a ravine. At least 55 of the around 70 people on board were killed in the accident, which happened in the early hours of Monday, local time. Rescuers struggled to recover the bodies from the creek into which the bus had plunged. Guatemalan President Bernardo Arévalo has declared three days of national mourning for the victims of the crash, one of the deadliest road traffic accidents in the region for years. The bus normally covered the route between San Cristóbal Acasaguastlán and Guatemala City, officials said. On Monday it had reportedly left the village of San Antonio La Paz at around 04:00 local time. About 30 minutes later, on the outskirts of Guatemala City, it plunged 20m (65ft) from a bridge into a creek carrying wastewater. Photos from the scene show the bus, lying on its roof, wheels in the air, in the shallow water. Local media said the bus had been full of students, commuters, and people on their way to the capital for medical appointments. As news of the accident spread, worried relatives gathered at the foot of the bridge waiting for news of their loved ones. One woman told Guatemalan news site La Hora that her 67-year-old husband had set off at four in the morning but had never made it to work. Another woman had identified the body of her brother, who had been on board the bus. Rescue workers said they had retrieved 53 bodies so far. Two people who had been rescued alive from the wreck died in hospital, bringing the total number of dead to 55. The 24-year-old driver is reportedly among those who died. Eyewitnesses described seeing the vehicle crash into two cars before it hit the guardrail and fell into the precipice. Investigators said they would check if the driver could have lost control due to a brake failure. Guatemala's communications minister, Miguel Díaz Bobadilla, told reporters the bus was around 30 years old but had a valid licence for carrying passengers. Díaz Bobadilla added that officials were checking if it may have carried more weight than it should have. Police are also investigating a gun they found on board the bus. The discovery of the weapon has given rise to speculation in local media that the driver may have panicked or been injured when he was threatened with the gun. The deputy director-general of Guatemala's National Civil Police, Helver Beltetón, said the gun was registered to one of the deceased passengers, who worked as a private security guard. Beltetón said that police were not ""ruling out any hypothesis"". He added that ""the brakes could have failed but we're also not ruling out an accident or a criminal act, all that will be investigated""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4mnznmwlvo,Ecuador election ends in a 'tie' prompting run-off,2025-02-10T22:04:40.889Z,Ione Wells Jessica Cruz,"Ecuador's presidential election will go to a second round after a closely contested first-round result failed to produce an outright winner. The electoral authorities called it a ""technical tie"" after the incumbent centre-right candidate, Daniel Noboa, and his main left-wing challenger Luisa González received nearly identical percentages of the vote. The pair will now face a run-off in April. The result is far narrower than opinion polls had predicted, indicating the second round could be harder to call. As of 17:00 local time (22:00 GMT), with more than 94% of the ballots counted, Noboa had a 44.2% share of the vote and González 43.9%, according to local media. The narrow result also dashed the hopes of Noboa's supporters, who had been buoyed by an early exit poll suggesting he might clinch victory outright. The president's supporters gathered in Quito, waving flags, donning T-shirts with his image and holding life-size cardboard cut-outs of the incumbent president. These cut-outs, depicting Noboa in various outfits – from suits to tank tops and sunglasses – have become ubiquitous symbols across the country decorating front doors, apartment windows, and even car rooftops. Noboa's presidency has been defined by his focus on tackling severe gang violence. He implemented emergency measures to deploy the military to streets and prisons to curb rising crime. Many of his supporters hope he will secure a mandate in the run-off to continue his security policies. ""He's helped us a lot, from when there was gang violence so bad that we couldn't even go out,"" said Fernanda Iza. The 45-year-old added: ""The support of the military he's introduced – their presence is already helping. ""He has brought us a certain stability. There are many problems still pending, but I hope he continues with his plan."" Juan Diego Escobar, 16, expressed optimism about Noboa's chances. ""I think the majority of people who voted for other candidates will prefer to vote for Daniel Noboa in the second round,"" he said. ""Noboa handles insecurity well. Crime is fairly well controlled. I think he will also improve the economy."" Miriam Naranjo said despite being the incumbent, Noboa represented ""change"". She added: ""We need the work that he has been doing so far to continue. It's only been a short time. We were expecting a bigger margin, so we have to work to keep that support for our candidate."" Despite some successes, such as the capture of some major gang leaders and a slight reduction in prison violence, violent crime remains a major issue. Violent deaths fell in 2024 but stayed near record levels. In January 2025 alone 750 homicides were reported. González – a protégé of former president Rafael Correa – has criticised Noboa for failing to deliver on key promises, such as boosting the economy, cutting fuel prices, and addressing violent crime. While she has proposed similar military and police operations to combat crime, her campaign has emphasised increased social spending in Ecuador's most violent regions. Noboa's critics also accused him of a slow response to a severe drought that led to prolonged power cuts last year. The incumbent also sparked controversy during the campaign by refusing to delegate his presidential duties to Vice-President Verónica Abad, citing an electoral law loophole. This decision became part of a public spat between the two. Luisa González's supporters see her as a chance for change. Gonzalo Cajas, 46, said: ""Why is there crime? There is poverty. There is hunger. So there should be someone who is really aware of Ecuadorean workers so that the country moves forward."" Alejandra Tufiño, 42, added: ""The country's security is in pieces. I want change. I'm not saying that she's going to solve it – but let's see what happens if we give her a chance."" Some voters remain disillusioned with both candidates. Gabriela Cajo, 39, who backed a candidate from the party of assassinated 2023 presidential hopeful Fernando Villavicencio, expressed frustration with the lack of progress on crime. ""Daniel Noboa represents fear, and we represent hope, change. We do not want a state of war, we want peace,"" she said. ""I think we are all annoyed with the electoral processes in the country, and the last thing we want is a second round and more expenditure of resources. ""There will be tremendous polarisation. There will be a lot of opposition to whoever wins. Once again, we will have to choose who is the least worst."" Whoever is victorious in April will face significant challenges. Ecuador continues to grapple with rampant crime, as drug cartels battle for control of lucrative trafficking routes through its ports. Kidnappings and murders remain daily occurrences. The country is also struggling with high unemployment, a weak economy, and an energy crisis that caused blackouts of up to 14 hours last year. Noboa has pledged to address these issues by creating jobs, attracting investment, and increasing renewable energy production. Meanwhile, González has emphasised the need for economic reform, social investment, and a stronger focus on tackling poverty."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3y4g7dy2o,Tsunami alerts cancelled after Caribbean earthquake,2025-02-09T04:50:00.195Z,Thomas Mackintosh,"Tsunami warnings issued after a powerful 7.6-magnitude earthquake rocked the Caribbean Sea have been cancelled, the US Geological Survey (USGS) has said. Officials say the earthquake's epicentre was about 20 miles (32.1km) north of Honduras and 130 miles (209.2km) south-west of the Cayman Islands when it struck on Saturday evening local time. The US Tsunami Warning System had initially issued warnings to more than a dozen of countries - including waves of up to three metres (10ft). But, it later said the threat had passed. Advisories were also issued by the Tsunami Warning System for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands following the earthquake - which were both also later cancelled. The Cayman Islands government had warned residents of coastal areas to move inland in a message on its website. It is unclear if there has been any movement or damage on land. The quake was the biggest to hit the region since 2021, when a 7.2 magnitude earthquake struck Haiti, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. About three hours after the earthquake, US authorities warned that ""minor sea level fluctuations"" of up to 30cm (11.8 inches) could still occur, but that any serious threat had passed. The USGS said large earthquakes at this location of the plate boundary are not unexpected. In 2018 a 7.5-magnitude earthquake occurred nearby, causing some damage and a small tsunami, it said. ""Luckily, the remote location of these earthquakes limits the potential for significant damage due to shaking,"" it added. Separately, the US National Tsunami Warning Centre said there are no alerts for the mainland US coast."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c05ly8gp0llo,Dozens killed in bus crash in southern Mexico,2025-02-08T23:17:35.301Z,Thomas Mackintosh,"At least 41 people have died in an accident involving a bus in southern Mexico, the government in the state of Tabasco has said. Images show the bus completely burned out after it was engulfed by flames following the collision which happened in the early hours of Saturday morning near to the small city of Escárcega. Bus operator Tour's Acosta said 48 passengers were onboard the vehicle - which had been travelling from Cancun to Tabasco - when it collided with a ""trailer"". Tour's Acosta added it was ""profoundly sorry about what happened"" and said it was working with authorities to find out the cause, adding that the bus had been travelling within speed limits. Reuters news agency reported that the government of Tabasco state said in a statement that 41 people had died, and recovery work was still ongoing. ""The public ministry has informed us that the investigation will be taking effect in the prosecutor's office of the municipality of Candelaria, Campeche, for this reason the relatives of our passengers and friends will have to go to this department to perform the relevant procedures,"" Tour's Acosta said on Facebook. The government state of Tabasco said recovery work is continuing - including efforts to identify those killed. Authorities will give an update with details on the number of victims and their identities later on Saturday, said the secretary of government of Tabasco, Ramiro Lopez. Local council Palacio Municipal de Comalcalco has said it will support the transfer of the bodies of the victims in the passenger bus accident."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz0lg9pedz1o,'We left pieces of our life behind': Indigenous group flees drowning island,2025-02-08T01:47:48.932Z,Gonzalo Cañada and Agustina Latourrette,"""If the island sinks, I will sink with it,"" Delfino Davies says, his smile not fading for a second. There is silence, except for the swish of his broom across the floor of the small museum he runs documenting the life of his community in Panama, the Guna. ""Before, you could hear children shouting… music everywhere, neighbours arguing,"" he says, ""but now all the sounds have gone"". His community, living on the tiny low-lying island of Gardi Sugdub, is the first in Panama to be relocated because of climate change. The government has said they face ""imminent risk"" from rising sea levels, which scientists say are likely to render the island uninhabitable by 2050. In June last year, most of the residents abandoned this cramped jumble of wooden and tin homes for rows of neat prefabricated houses on the mainland. The relocation has been praised by some as a model for other groups worldwide whose homes are under threat, but even so, it has divided the community. ""My father, my brother, my sisters-in-law and my friends are gone,"" says Delfino. ""Sometimes the children whose families have stayed cry, wondering where their friends have gone, he says. House after house is padlocked. About 1,000 people left, while about 100 stayed - some because there was not enough room in the new settlement. Others, like Delfino, are not fully convinced climate change is a threat, or simply did not want to leave. He says he wants to stay close to the ocean, where he can fish. ""The people that lose their tradition lose their soul. The essence of our culture is on the islands,"" he adds. The Guna have lived on Gardi Sugdub since the 19th Century, and even longer on other islands in this archipelago off Panama's northern coast. They fled from the mainland to escape Spanish conquistadors and, later, epidemics and conflict with other indigenous groups. They are known for their clothes called ""molas"", decorated with colourful designs. The Guna currently inhabit more than 40 other islands. Steve Paton, a scientist at the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute in Panama, says it is ""almost a certainty"" that most, if not all, of the islands will be submerged before the end of the century. As climate change causes the Earth to heat up, sea levels are rising as glaciers and ice sheets melt and seawater expands as it warms. Scientists warn that hundreds of millions of people living in coastal areas around the world could be at risk by the end of the century. On Gardi Sugdub, waves whipped up during the rainy season wash into homes, lapping below the hammocks where families sleep. Mr Paton says, ""it is very unlikely that the island will be habitable by 2050, based on current and projected rates of sea level rise"". However, the first discussions about relocation began, more than a decade ago, because of population growth, not climate change. The island is just 400m long and 150m wide. Some residents see overcrowding as the more pressing problem. But others, like Magdalena Martínez, fear the rising sea: ""Every year, we saw the tides were higher,"" she says. ""We couldn't cook on our stoves and it was always flooded… so we said 'we have to get out of here'."" Magdalena was among those who clambered into motor boats and wooden canoes last June, bound for new homes. ""I brought just my clothes and some kitchen utensils,"" she says. ""You feel like you are leaving pieces of your life on the island."" The new community, Isberyala, is - weather permitting - just 15 minutes by boat, followed by a five-minute drive, from Gardi Sugdub. But it feels like another world. Identical white and yellow homes line tarmacked roads. Magdalena's eyes light up as she shows off the ""little house"" where she lives with her 14-year-old granddaughter Bianca and her dog. Each house has a small area of land behind it – a luxury not available on the island. ""I want to plant yucca, tomatoes, bananas, mangoes and pineapples,"" she enthuses. ""It is quite sad to leave a place you've been in for so long. You miss your friends, the streets where you lived, being so close to the sea,"" she says. Isberyala was built with $15m (£12m) from the Panamanian government and additional funding from the Inter-American Development Bank. In its new meeting house, which is roofed with branches and leaves in the traditional style, waits Tito López, the community's sayla – or leader. ""My identity and my culture aren't going to change, it's just the houses that have changed,"" he says. He is lying in a hammock, and explains that as long as the hammock keeps its place in Guna culture, ""the heart of the Guna people will be alive"". When a Guna dies, they lie for a day in their hammock for family and friends to visit. It is then buried next to them. In the state-of-the-art new school, students aged 12 and 13 are rehearsing Guna music and dances. Boys in bright shirts play pan pipes, while girls wearing molas shake maracas. The cramped school on the island has closed now, and students whose families stayed there travel each day to the new building with its computers, sports fields and library. Magdalena says conditions in Isberyala are better than on the island, where she says they had only four hours of electricity a day and had to fetch drinking water by boat from a river on the mainland. In Isberyala, the power supply is constant, but the water - pumped from wells nearby - is only switched on for a few hours a day. The system has at times broken down for days at a time. Also, there is no healthcare yet. Another resident, Yanisela Vallarino, says one evening her young daughter was unwell and she had to arrange transport back to the island late at night to see a doctor. Panamanian authorities told the BBC that construction of a hospital in Isberyala stalled a decade ago over lack of funding. But they said they hoped to revive the plan this year, and were assessing how to create space for remaining residents to move from the island. Yanisela is delighted that she is now able to attend evening classes in the new school, but she still returns to the island frequently. ""I'm not used to it yet. And I miss my house,"" she says. Communities around the world will be ""inspired"" by the way the residents of Gardi Sugdub have confronted their situation, says Erica Bower, a researcher on climate displacement at Human Rights Watch. ""We need to learn from these early cases to understand what success even looks like,"" she says. As afternoon arrives, the school activities give way to the shouts and scuffles of football, basketball and volleyball. ""I prefer this place to the island because we have more space to play,"" says eight-year-old Jerson, before diving for a football. Magdalena sits with her granddaughter, teaching her to sew molas. ""It's hard for her, but I know she's going to learn. Our unique ways can't be lost,"" says Magdalena. Asked what she misses about the island, she replies: ""I wish we were all here."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg7zpr7779go,Ecuador chooses president against backdrop of gang violence,2025-02-07T17:39:06.152Z,Ione Wells,"""The entire town feels like it is in a pandemic, locked up without being able to go out and enjoy our lives due to violence."" That is how ""Jorge"" - not his real name - feels about his neighbourhood of Guayaquil, a city in southern Ecuador. His father, Marcos Elías León Maruri, was kidnapped there by the Los Tiguerones gang. A person is killed every two hours in Ecuador and seven are kidnapped daily, according to government figures. That's why security is the top issue for voters ahead of the first round of the presidential election on Sunday, in which incumbent Daniel Noboa is being challenged by 15 other candidates. Whoever wins will be tasked with restoring security to the country, which has gone from being one of the safest to among the most dangerous in the region. The surge in violence is partly down to Ecuador's location, and the soaring demand for cocaine in the drug's biggest markets like the US, the UK, and Europe. Much of the world's cocaine, from coca leaves grown in Colombia and Peru, leaves the continent through Ecuador's ports, and powerful gangs battle to control this lucrative route. Many of these gangs also engage in kidnapping for ransom. Mr León Maruri was one of their victims. Hours after he was seized, Jorge received a text. It read: ""I have your father. How much will you pay for the life of your family?"" The next morning, he received a video showing his father tied up with his finger being cut off. The gang initially demanded $100,000 (£80,000). Jorge didn't have it and began negotiating: ""They wanted $30,000 or they would cut off another finger."" Jorge scrambled to offer them $5,000 and his television, PlayStation and car. Just as the captors had agreed on a handover, police called him. They'd found a corpse resembling his father. ""They had left my father's body with his finger in a bottle tied to his hand – as a mockery."" Jorge's life has since unravelled. He rarely leaves his home, now plastered with CCTV cameras he anxiously monitors. His wife and daughter have fled the country. He doesn't go to work any more because the gang know the location. The current government under President Daniel Noboa has responded to the surge in violence by militarising the streets, giving police heightened powers to use force and raid buildings, and by building new maximum-security prisons. Jorge supports these measures but criticises the justice system. ""The government is working hard against corruption and equipping the police a lot. But it is of no use if the justice system sets them free. They care more about their rights than ours."" While some, like Jorge, back Noboa's measures, others feel they enable human rights abuses – a key tension in this election. I put this to Major Cristian Aldaz, from the Federal Police, during a raid in the violence-wracked city of Durán, as heavily armed security forces detained a man accused of kidnap and murder. ""Human rights, yes, but what about human rights for good people? We're in a war. Mafias use machine guns, grenades. The militarisation aims to establish peace,"" he says. Polls still have Noboa as the front-runner, but he has lost some ground in recent months to his main rival, Luisa González of the left-wing Citizen Revolution movement. On the campaign trail, González has promised human rights training for the security forces - although she also expressed support for the militarisation and tougher policing, including pledging 20,000 new officers. There is one case, in particular, that has made many Ecuadoreans fear the indiscriminate use of force by the security forces. Last year, four teenagers were seized by the military over an alleged theft when coming back from playing football. Their mutilated, burned bodies were later found. Sixteen soldiers have been detained and charged with the boys' ""forced disappearance"" and are under investigation for murder. They deny this, saying they eventually let the boys go. The bedroom of two of the boys - Ismael and Josué Arroyo – is typical of that of many teenagers: littered with clothes and football posters. Their father, Luis, clutches their football boots with raw grief. It's like he cannot believe that his sons' feet won't fill them again. ""Ismael wanted to fulfil his dream to be a professional footballer. A dream taken away by these soldiers,"" he cries. The only identifiable remains left of Ismael and Josué were a finger and a foot. Luis's anger and upset at the soldiers is clear. ""It's not like they caught and executed four dogs. They took four children away. Then went home for dinner."" ""We want justice,"" he adds. ""Children continue to be taken by the military and the government does nothing."" The anger the case has stirred may well lead some people to try and punish President Noboa at the ballot box. Luisa González, the woman hoping to defeat Noboa, has demanded justice and government resignations over the boys' deaths. Some voters argue that Noboa's policies are just not working. A public transport worker in Durán, who didn't want to be named, says gangs are calling him to extort money even from within maximum-security prisons. He describes how gang members force drivers to pay ""vacunas"" (Spanish for vaccines, the term used to refer to the daily extortion fees) to avoid attacks. ""There are colleagues who have already gone bankrupt. I haven't worked since they almost killed me,"" he tells me. Other critics point to a poor economy, with particularly high youth unemployment making young people vulnerable to gang recruitment. Slow responses to last year's drought also worsened hardships across the country, which relies on hydropower for 80% of its electricity, with power outages lasting up to 14 hours. One of those affected was Christian Guerrero. The 40-year-old, who lives in a poorer neighbourhood of Guayaquil, says the constant blackouts broke both his refrigerator and his TV. He agrees with the opposition that there's ""no plan"" to prevent further outages. The election comes about a year after President Noboa militarised the country through emergency decrees. For Carlos and Laura Ipaneque it's also about a year since their son, Carlos Javier Vega, was killed. He'd panicked at a checkpoint when he heard gunshots and drove off, instead of stopping, causing the military to shoot him dead. His parents illustrate the lose-lose dilemma many Ecuadoreans feel. They live in a gated street, their house surrounded by metal bars, terrified of gang violence. ""Crime continues, robberies continue, kidnappings continue, extortions continue,"" Laura explains. But some now fear the crackdown too. ""I don't want other people to have the pain that we have,"" Laura says through tears. For many voters, this election hinges on whether they see the problem as worse than the cure."

The Caribbean island has been in the grip of violent gangs for several years who have been treating the population with unrelenting brutality, Unicef said. Sexual violence against children has increased 1,000% since 2023, turning their bodies ""into battlegrounds"", spokesman James Elder said. Unicef estimates 85% of the capital Port-au-Prince is under the control of gangs. More than one million children are living with the constant threat of violence. Mr Elder gave an example of a 16-year-old girl who had left home to go shopping, and then was seized by armed men. She was beaten, drugged, and repeatedly raped. She was held for around one month, he said, until the gang let her go when they realised her family had no money to pay a ransom. Kidnappings for extortion are common in Haiti. She is now in a UN shelter with dozens of other girls receiving care. Gang control in Port-au-Prince has led to an almost complete breakdown of law and order, the collapse of health services and emergence of a food security crisis. More than 5,600 people were killed in gang violence in Haiti last year alone. Haiti's transitional presidential council, the body created to organise elections and re-establish democratic order, appears to be in turmoil. The council replaced the interim prime minister in November but has made little progress towards organising long-delayed elections. Children are also being recruited by the gangs, sometimes forcibly, Unicef said. The organisation has come across child gang members who are as young as eight. The basics that Haitian children need for a normal childhood, even if they are still at home with their families, are virtually non-existent said Unicef. Schools and hospitals are barely functioning and tens of thousands of children are not in school. Unicef has created mobile safe spaces in Haiti to try to support children, and to prevent sexual violence. But last year, when it appealed for $221.4m (£177.8m) to fund its work in Haiti, it received just a quarter of that. It's feared now that with the US freeze on foreign aid affecting humanitarian projects worldwide, Haiti's needs will be neglected again."

Pictures and videos show the intensely coloured water flowing into an estuary, the Rio de la Plata, which borders an ecological reserve. Local media reports suggest the colour may have been caused by the dumping of textile dye, or by chemical waste from a nearby depot. The Environment Ministry said in a statement that water samples had been taken from the Sarandí canal to determine the cause of the colour change. By late afternoon the colour of the water had lost some of its intensity, the AFP news agency reported. Residents have claimed that many local companies dispose of toxic waste in the waterway, which runs through an area of leather processing and textile factories some 10km (6 miles) from the centre of the capital. A resident, a woman called Silvia, told local news channel C5N that although it is has turned red now, ""other times it was yellow, with an acidic smell that makes us sick even in the throat"". ""I live a block from the stream. Today, it has no smell. There are not many factories in the area, although there are warehouses."" Another resident, Maria Ducomls, told AFP industries in the region dump waste in the water, and said she had seen it coloured differently in the past - ""bluish, a little green, pink, a little lilac, with grease on top""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj9149j4nmzo,Panama denies US claims over free canal passages,2025-02-06T11:45:16.616Z,Malu Cursino,"Panama has denied making changes to allow US government vessels to transit the Panama Canal for free, following White House claims it had agreed to such a move. The State Department said in a statement on X that its government vessels ""can now transit the Panama Canal without charge fees, saving the US government millions of dollars a year"". Responding to the comments, the Panama Canal Authority (ACP) said it was ""empowered to set tolls and other fees for transiting the canal,"" adding that it had ""not made any adjustments to them"". US President Donald Trump has repeatedly voiced his desire to retake control of the waterway, which is key to global trade. The 51-mile (82km) Panama Canal cuts across the Central American nation and is the main link between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who has been on a visit to Latin American countries this week, demanded that Panama make ""immediate changes"" to what he calls the ""influence and control"" of China over the canal. America's top diplomat said Panama had to act or the US would take necessary measures to protect its rights under a treaty between the two countries. During a visit to the country, Rubio met Panama's President José Raúl Mulino, as well as the canal's administrator, Ricaurte Vásquez Morales. The ACP said after his visit that it had conveyed its intention to work with the US navy to optimise transit priority for its vessels through the canal. This commitment for dialogue with Washington remained, it said in a separate statement on Wednesday. US vessels make up a significant proportion of traffic in the canal. In 2024, 52% of transits through the waterway had ports of origin or destination in the United States, according to the canal's authorities. Up to 14,000 ships use the canal each year to avoid a lengthy and costly trip around the tip of South America. In his inaugural speech, President Trump said he planned to ""take back"" the canal, alleging that China was operating it and Panama had ""broken"" a promise to remain neutral. The plan was strongly rejected by Mulino, who said the key trade route ""is and will remain"" in the country's hands. He also rejected Trump's allegations about China's influence, saying there is ""no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration"". Trump recently reiterated his claim. Despite saying earlier this week he was ""not happy"" with the situation, he acknowledged that Panama had ""agreed to certain things"". Mulino has said his country will not continue its membership in China's infrastructure-building programme, the Belt and Road Initiative. The US built the canal in the early 20th Century but, after years of protest, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama in 1977 to gradually hand back control of the waterway, which Trump has branded ""a big mistake""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8975qp1n4qo,Argentina leader orders WHO exit in move mirroring Trump's,2025-02-05T17:19:29.815Z,Vanessa Buschschlüter Dominic Hughes,"The Argentine government led by Javier Milei has announced that it plans to pull out of the World Health Organisation (WHO). A spokesman for President Milei said the decision to exit the WHO was triggered by ""deep differences regarding health management especially during the [Covid-19] pandemic"". The announcement comes just over two weeks after US President Donald Trump signed an executive order to begin the process of withdrawing from the international health body. The two leaders have expressed admiration for each other, with Milei calling Trump's re-election the ""greatest political comeback in history"", while the US president described his Argentine counterpart as ""my favourite president"". The decision by President Milei to withdraw his country from the WHO follows the same arguments that underpinned the withdrawal of the United States. Both cited the response to the Covid-19 pandemic, which saw a long lockdown imposed in Argentina, as well as concerns over Chinese influence over the global health body. The difference is the impact this is likely to have on the WHO itself. The USA is by far the biggest individual contributor to the UN body, putting in around $950m (£760m) in 2024, nearly 15% of the total budget. The US withdrawal will pose some difficult financial questions. Argentina on the other hand contributes roughly $8m a year. That is unlikely to make any significant material difference. The bigger question is whether other leaders who share President Trump's world view, as President Milei clearly does, decide to take similar action. If more states pull out – and that is admittedly a big if - the credibility of the WHO as the one truly global health body could take a hit. Argentine media say they expect President Milei to sign an executive order in the coming days which will begin the process of Argentina pulling out from the WHO. Speaking at a news conference, presidential spokesman Manuel Adorni said that ""we Argentines are not going to allow an international body to interfere with our sovereignty, and even less with our health"". The spokesman argued that an exit from the WHO would provide Argentina with more flexibility to implement policies tailored to its own interests and to administer its funds as it saw fit. President Milei, who describes himself as an ""anarcho-capitalist"", has been critical of the WHO for some time but the idea of leaving the body appears to have gained traction in the days after Donald Trump signed an executive order setting in motion the US's exit from the international body. The two heads of state appear to share mutual admiration for each other. Javier Milei was the first foreign leader to meet Trump after his election victory on 5 November. Speaking at a gala at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort on the night of their meeting, Milei said that ""the winds of freedom [were] blowing much stronger since Trump's victory"". Asked by reporters on Wednesday whether President Milei was planning to withdraw from other international bodies or treaties, the presidential spokesman refused to rule out anything. ""The president is very determined when it comes to making Argentina freer, so any link that Argentina has with bodies that go against its freedoms, we're going to do our utmost to prevent them from interfering in the lives of Argentines."" Environmental activists in Argentina say they fear that Milei will follow in Trump's footsteps and also set the wheels in motion to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement - the international treaty which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvg4jx8xyjgo,Could US criminals be sent to El Salvador's mega-jail?,2025-02-04T21:25:49.569Z,Vanessa Buschschlüter,"US Secretary of State Marco Rubio could not have been more complimentary about the deal he struck with the president of El Salvador on Monday. The Trump administration's top diplomat appeared delighted yet stunned by the fact that President Nayib Bukele should have ""agreed to the most unprecedented, extraordinary, extraordinary migratory agreement anywhere in the world"". Bukele had offered to take in people deported from the US, regardless of their nationality, and house them in El Salvador's mega-jail. ""We can send them and he will put them in his jails,"" Rubio said. While that was already a win for President Donald Trump, whose priority has been to speed up the removal of undocumented migrants from the US, the real surprise came in the part of the deal Rubio mentioned next. ""He [Bukele] has also offered to do the same for dangerous criminals currently in custody and serving their sentences in the United States even though they're US citizens or legal residents,"" Rubio said. The Salvadorean leader confirmed that he had ""offered the United States of America the opportunity to outsource part of its prison system"". He clarified that El Salvador would be ""willing to take in only convicted criminals"" and that his government would do so ""in exchange for a fee"". Bukele also revealed where he would house those deported from the US: ""our mega-prison"". The mega-jail, also known as Cecot (short for Terrorism Confinement Centre), has become emblematic of Bukele's iron-fist approach to crime and punishment. The maximum-security prison, one of the largest in Latin America, opened in January 2023 and can house 40,000 inmates, according to government figures. Inmates are confined to windowless cells, sleep on bare metal bunks and are constantly monitored by armed guards - some of whom watch over them from atop the lattice ceiling. BBC News Mundo's Leire Ventas, who was allowed to take an official tour of the facility last year after the BBC had repeatedly asked for access, described how temperatures in the cells would reach 35C. Take a look at graphics and maps of the mega-jail With access to the prison severely restricted and journalists only allowed on occasional and carefully choreographed official tours, the number of inmates per cell is not clear. Some rights groups put it at 80 prisoners while others say it can go up to more than 150. Asked by our journalist what the maximum capacity was, the prison's director responded ""where you can fit 10 people, you can fit 20"". Prisoners are locked up inside their cells 24 hours a day - except for 30 minutes of group exercise in a windowless corridor. The layout of the jail is no coincidence. Following a particularly bloody weekend in 2022, when more than 70 people were killed in the small Central American nation, President Bukele wrote on social media: ""Message for the gangs: because of your actions, your 'homeboys' will not be able to see a ray of sunshine."" Building of the Cecot mega-jail started shortly afterwards. Conditions at the facility and the treatment of inmates has come under severe criticism from human rights groups. Miguel Sarre, a former member of the United Nations Subcommittee for the Prevention of Torture, has described it as a ""concrete and steel pit"". So could the Trump administration send US citizens there? On Tuesday, Trump told reporters he would embrace the idea but questioned its legality. ""If we had the legal right to do it, I would do it in a heartbeat,"" he said during an executive order signing ceremony in the Oval Office. ""I don't know if we do or not. ""We're looking at that right now, but we could make deals where we'd get these animals out of our country."" But any attempt to deport US citizens or people lawfully resident in the US to a foreign jail is bound to face legal challenges. US citizens who were born in the United States enjoy legal protection from deportation. There are some cases, however, in which naturalised citizens - those who were not born in the US and who obtained US citizenship after birth through a legal process - can have their citizenship revoked. This tends to occur when the person in question used fraud to obtain the citizenship in the first place. Alex Cuic, an immigration lawyer and professor at Case Western Reserve University in Ohio, told the BBC that naturalised US citizens suspected of ties to criminal gangs or terrorist organisations - such as the Tren de Aragua criminal gang or the Mara Salvatrucha, known as MS-13 - could also, in theory, be stripped of US citizenship. ""If they find out you were a member of any group that persecuted or threatened to persecute others, they can try to denaturalise you,"" Mr Cuic added. ""So, if you had gang ties and never disclosed them, they could use that as a reason to denaturalise you."" Once a person has been ""denaturalised"", they are at risk of deportation. Mr Cuic pointed out that any such move would have to be preceded by a ""formal court process"" conducted in a federal court. But the lawyer warned that ""citizenship is not something that is definitively forever if you are naturalised"". He stressed, though, that he had ""never heard"" of cases of natural-born US citizens being sent abroad for imprisonment for crimes committed and prosecuted in the US. Shev Dalal-Dheini, the director of government relations for the American Immigration Lawyers Association, similarly said that she had ""never heard of such a suggestion"" as sending American citizens to serve US prison sentences overseas. While she acknowledged that there were various scenarios in which naturalised US citizens could lose their citizenship, she said that ""you can't denaturalise a natural-born citizen"". The status of lawful permanent residents in the US, however, is more precarious than that of US citizens. They can be deported if they violate certain provisions of the Immigration and Nationality Act, which include committing drug offences, violent crimes or crimes such as theft, fraud or assault. Like naturalised citizens, they can also be deported if they obtained their residency through fraud. Permanent lawful residents who are involved in terrorism, espionage or any activity threatening US national interest could also be deported. This last point is important in light of the executive order President Trump issued on his inauguration day in which he designated drug cartels as ""foreign terrorist organisations"". Two criminal organisations named in the executive order, Tren de Aragua and MS-13, were also mentioned last week by Trump's special envoy for Latin America, Mauricio Claver-Carone. Speaking at a briefing about Marco Rubio's trip to El Salvador, Claver-Carone not only praised Bukele's handling of the MS-13 - a gang which is deeply rooted in El Salvador and has long terrorised its citizens - but also said that Bukele could offer the answer on how to deal with the Venezuelan gang Tren de Aragua. Claver-Carone also appeared to argue that the mere prospect of being sent to a Salvadoran jail could drive Venezuelan gang members back to their homeland. ""I bet they're going to want to go back to Venezuela instead of dealing with the Mara prisons in El Salvador,"" he said of members of the Tren de Aragua gang. Rubio, too, seemed to stress that the Trump administration would first and foremost want to send members of these two notorious gangs to El Salvador's prisons. ""Any unlawful immigrant and illegal immigrant in the United States who is a dangerous criminal - MS-13, Tren de Aragua, whatever it may be - he has offered his jails,"" Rubio said after his talks with Bukele. While it is by no means clear who - if anyone - will be sent from the US to El Salvador's mega-prison, what is certain is that with his ""unprecedented offer of friendship"", Bukele has landed firmly in Trump's favour at a time when relations between the US and its neighbours have been rocked by the US president's threats to impose tariffs on their goods.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cz9eg8w32yzo,Trouble in Paradise: Battling crime wave in Trinidad & Tobago,2025-01-26T02:40:07.785Z,Anselm Gibbs,"For Margaret Charles, the new year started just as the old one ended, days filled with grief and no end to a mother's worst nightmare, after her son's life was snatched away in a brutal murder. Sitting on the porch of her home located in Moruga, a rural town in south Trinidad, Margaret ran through a range of emotions as she spoke about her son, Shakeem Charles, who was killed last July. ""I'm being faced with it every day,"" Margaret told the BBC. ""There's a letter that Amarah wrote to her father for Christmas, and when we sat down for lunch, she said: 'Nobody is to sit on that chair, that chair is for daddy.'"" Shakeem's two children, Amarah, seven, and Amare, three, now spend a lot more time with their grandparents. Their 32-year-old father was just one of the many murder victims in Trinidad and Tobago in 2024, which was the Caribbean nation's deadliest year on record with 624 homicides, according to data from local police. Shakeem was an Information Technology technician, but his family said that shortly before he was killed, he had started working with a local ride-hailing company to earn extra money. Margaret said her son went missing on 9 July after taking a job to drop off a passenger in another southern town. The ride-hailing company said Shakeem's only trip that day ended at around 17:25 local time. That night, calls to his mobile phone went unanswered. However, his family got a notification for an ATM cash withdrawal from a joint bank account. The following day, through GPS tracking, his car was found abandoned more than 80km (50 miles) away in north-east Trinidad. Margaret recalls how, after four days of searching, Shakeem's body was discovered in the same southern town where he was hired to drop the passenger. An autopsy determined he died from multiple gunshot wounds. Police are yet to charge anyone in connection with the killing. With murders soaring, Trinidad and Tobago's government declared a state of emergency on 30 December. It was originally due to last 15 days, but as it was about to run out, parliament voted to extend it for a further three months until mid-April. Authorities blamed gang warfare for six murders over the two preceding days, while government officials said concern about reprisal killings prompted the state of emergency. Five of those six killings happened in one shooting incident on 29 December, in Laventille, an area just outside the capital, Port of Spain. Some residents say crime has become part of the culture in Laventille. Joeth Roberts says that what stopped him from joining a gang when the opportunity arose was his upbringing. ""I was approached by a person who was looking for underlings, someone to run the block,"" Joeth recalls. ""He offered me a firearm and other stuff, but that wasn't in me,"" Joeth says, thanking his parents for the way they brought him up. Shaquille Gaskin, who also lives in Laventille, told the BBC that he knew a few people ""who are very excited to do the wrong things"". Shaquille is a musician who plays the steelpan. He says he remains firmly on the right side of the law, but that there are others in the neighbourhood who are drawn to crime. ""That's because that's what they know, they grow up seeing that, seeing the older ones doing that, so they automatically go into that."" The musician is convinced that there are lots of opportunities for people in so-called ""crime hot spots"" to be law-abiding citizens, but he thinks the government and others offering those opportunities should engage with at-risk communities more actively. He argues that in order to get young people on board, a consistent effort has to be made to get them to stay on the right path rather than be tempted by gang leaders' offers. It is an opinion echoed by Dr Malisa Neptune-Figaro. The criminologist at the University of the West Indies says that her research suggests that gangs started becoming more prevalent in Trinidad and Tobago at the beginning of this millennium. Dr Neptune-Figaro has also found that many offenders were victims themselves at some point. ""You have to look at how they feel as persons. If you feel despondent and you don't feel like you belong in our contemporary society and mainstream society, you're going to have this parallel society, where you feel like you belong,"" she says. ""You have to talk about what the gangs do for them as well, [why] they feel at home."" The state of emergency gives law enforcement officers extra powers to make arrests and conduct searches without warrants. Minister of National Security Fitzgerald Hinds said the state of emergency had already led to a reduction in murders, shootings, robberies and car thefts. Police say they have arrested over 650 people. However, Dr Malisa Neptune-Figaro warns that this crime-fighting tool may only work in the short term. The criminologist at the University of the West Indies argues that long term, there should be a focus on refurbishing and revamping the criminal justice system. But she says that there has to be a wider approach too, incorporating ""different elements of society, our education system, finding jobs for persons who are unemployed, giving them alternative measures to crime, better parenting styles"". For Margaret Charles, the extension of the state of emergency has raised her hope that the police will catch whoever killed her son and bring them to justice. ""Not only Shakeem's case, but in any case, that people who they suspect and for some reason or the other they couldn't hold them and question them or probably search, that something happens,"" she says."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c7vd7njv4zzo,"Rebel feud displaces more than 30,000 in northern Colombia",2025-01-22T15:14:05.245Z,Vanessa Buschschlüter and Ana Hanssen,"More than 32,000 people have fled the northern Colombian region of Catatumbo where two rival rebel groups are engaged in a bloody battle. At least 80 people have been killed over recent days amid the surge in fighting between rebels from the National Liberation Army (ELN) and dissident factions of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc). One official government agency said it had received reports of ELN rebels going house-to-house and killing those suspected of ties with rival groups. The government has declared a state of emergency and the first of a planned deployment of 5,000 soldiers have arrived in the area. President Gustavo Petro said on Tuesday that the state ""had failed"" to contain the violence but that it would learn from that failure. His government has reactivated arrest warrants for 31 top commanders of the ELN, which had been suspended while the rebel group held peace talks with the government. Last week, President Petro suspended the talks for a second time in less than a year due to the violence in Catatumbo. The fighting has been so fierce that 32,000 people have fled their homes, according to figures provided by the Ombudsman's office on Tuesday. Many have sought refuge in schools and sports stadiums which have been converted into impromptu shelters. Investigative news programme Noticias Uno said it had seen a military intelligence report which suggested that the surge in violence between the two rival groups had been triggered by ""the loss of a multi-million-dollar cocaine shipment in November 2024"". According to the report, a member of the Farc dissident group known as Frente 33 came to an agreement with their rivals from the ELN to ""not interfere"" with each other's cocaine production and shipments. Both the ELN and the remnants of the Farc rebel group which remained active after the main guerrilla group signed a peace agreement in 2016 are heavily involved in the drugs trade. The pact between the two groups seems to have broken down over the ""lost"" cocaine shipment, the intelligence report suggests. Although it is not clear which ""lost"" stash the report is referring to, Colombian media have pointed out that in December last year counter-narcotics agents in the Dominican Republic seized 9.5 tonnes of cocaine which they said had originated in Catatumbo. The mountainous region, on Colombia's north-eastern border with Venezuela, is a hotspot for cocaine production and trafficking. President Petro, who was a member of a left-wing rebel group in his youth, said this week that ""what happened in Catatumbo is yet another example of a shift from insurgent guerrillas to narco-armed organisations"". He also referred to the ELN as a ""mafia"". Petro campaigned on a promise to bring ""total peace"" to Colombia but last week he said that ""the ELN has no will for peace""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2egwzvp080o,Panama rejects Trump vow to 'take back' Panama Canal,2025-01-20T22:44:32.037Z,Dearbail Jordan,"Panama's president has rejected a plan by Donald Trump to ""take back"" the Panama Canal, telling his US counterpart the key trade route ""is and will remain"" in the country's hands. In his inaugural speech, President Trump claimed that Panama had ""broken"" a promise to remain neutral, alleging that ""China is operating the Panama Canal"". President Jose Raul Mulino said he rejected Trump's words in their ""entirety"", adding there is ""no presence of any nation in the world that interferes with our administration"". The Panama Canal is one of the US's most important trade routes, with about 40% of all the country's container ships passing through the waterway between the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In the first address of his second term, Trump claimed: ""American ships are being severely overcharged and not treated fairly in any way, shape or form and that includes the United States Navy. ""And above all China is operating the Panama Canal and we didn't give it to China, we gave it to Panama, and we're taking it back."" The US built the canal in the early 20th century but, after years of protest, President Jimmy Carter signed a treaty with Panama in 1977 to gradually hand back control of the waterway, which Trump has branded ""a big mistake"". In 1999, Panama took full control of the canal with a treaty in place that it remain neutral and open to vessels of all nations. Following Trump's address, Mulino said in a social media post on X: ""The canal was not a concession from anyone. It was the result of generational struggles that culminated in 1999."" Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa operates two ports on the waterway - the Port of Balboa on the Pacific side of the route while Cristobal operates on the Atlantic end. Around 5% of global maritime trade passes through the 51-mile Panama Canal. Last week, Marco Rubio, Trump's nominee for secretary of state, told a senate confirmation hearing ""the very legitimate concern is these companies control both ends of this canal and at a time of conflict and the Chinese tell them 'shut it down and don't let the US go through there' we got a big, big problem. A big economic problem and a big national security and defence problem"". In his speech, Trump said that he wanted to be a ""peacemaker"" but Michael McFaul, the former US ambassador to Russia under President Obama wrote on social media: ""You can't be a president of peace and take back the Panama Canal."" As well as the Panama Canal, Trump has previously also said he wanted to acquire Greenland, the autonomous Danish territory. Denmark rejected any suggestion they would give it up. Trump did not mention Greenland in his address but he set out his expansionist vision for the next four years. ""The United States will once again consider itself a growing nation, one that increases our wealth, expands our territory, builds our cities, raises our expectations and carries our flag into new and beautiful horizons,"" he said."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cew5kn9xkp8o,Colombian drug gang violence kills 60 people,2025-01-19T10:19:53.314Z,Aleks Phillips,"The death toll from attacks by a rebel group in Colombia's Catatumbo region has risen to 60, the country's human rights office has said. Rival factions have been vying for control of the cocaine trade in the region - which sits near the border with Venezuela - for years. The Ombudsman's Office said the latest violence involved the National Liberation Army (ELN) - the largest armed group still active in Colombia - and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), which signed a peace treaty with the state in 2016. The attacks broke an uneasy truce between the guerrilla groups, which had been in peace negotiations with the government. The Ombudsman's Office, a government agency that oversees the protection of citizens' human and civil rights, previously reported that 40 had died in the violence. It said that many people, including community leaders and their families, were facing a ""special risk"" of being kidnapped or killed at the hands of the ELN. It noted that 20 people had recently been kidnapped, half of whom were women. The office said that among those killed were seven peace treaty signatories and Carmelo Guerrero, the leader of the Association for Peasant Unity in Catatumbo (Asuncat), a local advocacy group. Asuncat wrote on social media on Friday that Roger Quintero and Freiman Velasquez, members of its board of directors, had not been seen since the previous day, and that it suspected armed groups had taken them. ""In some communities in the region, food shortages are beginning to be reported, affecting local communities,"" the Ombudsman's Office wrote in a statement on Saturday, adding that thousands of people are believed to have been displaced by the violence. ""Elderly people, children, adolescents, pregnant women and people with disabilities are suffering the consequences of these events."" ""Catatumbo is once again stained with blood,"" the Association of Mothers of Catatumbo for Peace wrote on Friday. ""The bullets exchanged not only hurt those who hold the weapons, but also tear apart the dreams of our communities, break up families and sow terror in the hears of our children."" The Ombudsman's Office appeared to lay the blame for the latest violence on the ELN, which had been in peace talks with the Colombian government until they were suspended on Friday due to the violence in Catatumbo. President Gustavo Petro - who since his election in 2022 has sought to end violence between armed groups in the country - accused the ELN of ""war crimes"" and said the group ""shows no willingness to make peace"". The ELN accused Farc of having initiated the conflict by killing civilians in a statement on Saturday, according to Reuters news agency. Farc has not publicly responded to the allegation. On Saturday, the Colombian army announced it was sending additional troops to the region in an effort to restore peace."

The sculpture was unveiled during a ceremony marking the 490th anniversary of the city's founding. Pizarro founded Lima in 1535 after defeating the Inca Empire and claiming their lands for the Spanish crown. Indigenous leaders say he was a mass murderer who destroyed their culture, while those who supported the statue's return said Peru should not erase its history. The monument, which shows Pizarro on horseback with his sword drawn, was created by the American sculptor Charles Rumsey and offered by his widow to commemorate the city's fourth centenary in 1935. In 2003, it was moved to a park next to train tracks outside the city centre following calls for its removal. Luis Bogdanovich, who was in charge of restoring the historic centre, told local media the statue had become damaged by the constant passing of trains, which caused it to crack. Rafael López Aliaga, Lima's mayor, and Isabel Díaz Ayuso, president of the Community of Madrid, presented the bronze statue on Saturday alongside Mr Bogdanovich and several descendants of Pizarro in Lima's main square, Plaza de Armas. Díaz Ayuso said the ceremony was commemorating ""not only the birth of a city, but also the beginning of a historic encounter that forever transformed the world"", the Spanish daily El Pais reported. Dozens of Peruvians held a demonstration nearby opposing its return, according to the AFP news agency. ""This is an offence, an offence to all the indigenous peoples of Peru, Latin America and the world,"" one person said."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjddzxwgxdo,Cuba releases jailed activist Jose Daniel Ferrer,2025-01-17T14:42:03.445Z,Seher Asaf,"A leading Cuban dissident and activist has been released from jail as part of a wider prisoner release deal between the Cuban government and the United States. Jose Daniel Ferrer spent more than three years in prison following anti-government protests that swept through the Communist-run island in 2021. Under the agreement brokered by the Catholic Church, outgoing US President Joe Biden removed Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism just days before the end of his term. In return, Cuba said it would free 553 people, many of whom were detained during the anti-government protests.  The island began releasing the first of hundreds of prisoners on Wednesday, freeing about 20 people, according to local NGOs. Ferrer is one of the most recognised names among Cuban dissidents and pro-democracy activists. The 54-year-old leader of Cuba's Patriotic Union (Unpacu), an opposition group in the country, was jailed and charged with public disorder following the 2021 protests. ""I am at home, in fair health, but with the courage to continue fighting for the freedom of Cuba,"" Ferrer told Reuters in a phone conversation. Many of the prisoners released this week were arrested in association with 2021 protests, during which citizens demanded that the Cuban government do more to ease widespread food shortages and lower spiralling prices. Biden's move to remove Cuba from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism came just days ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's inauguration. Senator Marco Rubio, Trump's pick for secretary of state, has been critical of the decision to ease sanctions on Cuba, hinting that it could be reversed. Speaking at his Senate nomination hearing on Wednesday, Rubio said referring to some of the sanctions on Cuba that the Biden administration rescinded on Tuesday that ""the new administration is not bound by that decision"". Earlier, Trump's choice for national security adviser, Mike Waltz, said on Fox News that ""anything [the Biden administration] are doing right now, we can do back, and no-one should be under any illusion in terms of a change in Cuba policy"". The Cuban government says the island's designation as a state sponsor of terrorism is deeply unjust and aimed at harming its economy by making it impossible for Cuba to access international banking credits.

While Havana has cautiously welcomed the deal, there are doubts as to how long it will last after President-elect Donald Trump's pick for secretary of state, Marco Rubio, appeared to hint that it could be reversed. Speaking at his Senate nomination hearing on Wednesday, Rubio said referring to some of the sanctions on Cuba that the Biden administration rescinded on Tuesday that ""the new administration is not bound by that decision"". Earlier, Trump's choice for national security adviser, Mike Waltz, had said on Fox News that ""anything they [the Biden administration] are doing right now, we can do back, and no one should be under any illusion in terms of a change in Cuba policy"". Despite the doubts raised by Trump administration officials, Cuba released about 20 prisoners on Wednesday, according to local NGOs. One of those released was 53-year-old Donaida Pérez Paseiro, who had been sentenced to eight years in prison for taking part in the 2021 anti-government protests, during which citizens demanded that the Cuban government do more to ease widespread food shortages and lower spiralling prices. In a video she posted on social media, Ms Pérez Paseiro said that the Cuban government had used her and her fellow prisoners as ""a bargaining chip"" to leverage Cuba's removal from the US list of state sponsors of terrorism. In the recording, she also said she would continue to ""fight for Cuba's freedom"". Dariel Cruz García was also among those who were freed on Wednesday. The 23-year-old had been sentenced to 15 years in prison for sedition after joining in the 2021 protests. He told Reuters that officials had announced that he could serve the remainder of his sentence - which has been reduced since he was originally sentenced - at home. ""I escaped from hell to be with my family. I'll behave myself so I can move on,"" he told the news agency. The vice-president of Cuba's highest court, Maricela Sosa, said on TV that those freed had neither received an amnesty nor had they been pardoned and warned that they could be re-arrested if they broke the terms of their parole. There are also still hundreds of families awaiting news as to whether their loved ones will be among the 553 the government has agreed to release. ""They're desperate, all waiting with tremendous anxiety for a call from their children,"" Dariel Cruz García's mother told Reuters."

The situation is particularly dire in the capital, Port-au-Prince, where displacement has risen by 87% between 2023 and 2024, IOM figures show. Gangs control almost the entire city, leading to the collapse of the remaining health services and triggering food insecurity. More than 5,600 people were killed in gang violence in Haiti last year alone. IOM Spokesman Kennedy Okoth Omondi said many of the more than one million displaced people had had to flee multiple times as the gangs expanded their territory in Port-au-Prince. An estimated 85% of the capital is now estimated to be under gang control. Most of those displaced fled Port-au-Prince for rural areas, where resources are limited, the IOM warned. Its Director-General, Amy Pope, said that Haiti needed ""sustained humanitarian assistance right now to save and protect lives"". Half of those displaced are children, according to the IOM's figures. The agency described how families were ""struggling to survive in makeshift shelters while facing mounting health and protection risks"". Haiti has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Moïse. A UN-backed multinational security force arrived in Haiti in June to try and re-establish control but has so far made few inroads into gang-held territory. The international police force, which is meant to bolster the Haitian National Police force, is underfunded and lacks the necessary equipment to take on the heavily armed gangs. Meanwhile, the Transitional Presidential Council (TPC) - the body created to organise elections and re-establish democratic order in Haiti - appears to be in turmoil. The TPC replaced the interim prime minister in November and seems to have made little progress towards organising long-delayed elections."

The Bethania neighbourhood in the city of Ipatinga was the worst affected by the mudslides, which were triggered by torrential rain. The mayor's office said that 204mm (8in) of rain fell in Ipatinga on Sunday morning. Landslides following torrential rains are not uncommon in the rainy season, with neighbourhoods precariously built on steep hillsides the worst hit. Ipatinga Mayor Gustavo Nunes declared a state of emergency. At least 150 people have been left homeless in the city, which is located some 570km north of Rio de Janeiro. The mayor said the city had been surprised by the intense rains. ""There was no time for people to prepare,"" according to Nunes. At least nine people are confirmed to have died in Ipatinga, while another body was found half-an-hour's drive north in Santana do Paraíso. Local media reported that two youths managed to escape alive from a home where five of their relatives died buried under the mud. The city's health centre was also damaged by the landslides, Ipatinga's health minister said. ""At this time, the health centre is in no state to attend to people and all the patients who were here waiting to be transferred have been moved,"" Walisson Medeiros said. He thanked neighbouring cities for offering to help. The governor of Minas Gerais, Romeu Zema, said he would visit the affected area later on Monday."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77j7n4kyy5o,Nostalgia and passion fuel young couple running old-school photo lab,2025-01-12T00:26:52.079Z,Fritz Pinnow,"""It all started as a small passion project,"" says Fabriccio Díaz, 28, who, together with his wife Lucía Ramírez, 25, runs the only fully operational photo film development lab in Central America from their apartment in Guatemala City. ""Now we have over 60 clients a month and have developed over 800 rolls just this year,"" he adds. Arca Film Lab has been in high demand this year and is the only photo film development lab in Central America that develops every type of analogue photography film, which includes the rather complicated process of developing positives in a process known as E-6. Fabriccio, who studied cinematography, explains that the great inaccessibility of high-quality film development services in Central America gave him the first decisive push to learn how to develop his first film. ""When we started experimenting and developing film in our apartment, friends started asking us to develop film for them and it all just took off somehow,"" Lucía recalls. And so, the Arca Film Lab was born in September 2023 as a simple Instagram page offering film development services in Guatemala. The couple have taught themselves most of the skills needed to develop film by watching YouTube videos and by reaching out to other film labs internationally and asking for tips. ""We were surprised that so many people responded to our questions. A lot of the veterans in the photo development world helped us out by sharing their experiences and tricks. We are really grateful for that,"" says Fabriccio. Fabriccio and Lucía's love of photography is not confined to developing film, though. The couple also organise ""photo walks"" in which a group of people get together in Antigua, the old centre of Guatemala City, to take pictures and experiment with old analogue cameras. For young analogue photography enthusiasts like Iván Ortiz, 22, snapping photos with a camera which is older than he is gives him something modern cameras cannot compete with. ""It's like having nostalgia for a generation we were never a part of,"" he tells the BBC. Iván says that older people do not always get the recent hype for old cameras and film. ""They just don't understand our perspective,"" he explains. ""We live in a world where everything is digital and fast. Through analogue photography, I have to make conscious decisions about my photos and focus solely on the act of photographing. And the best part of it is that you have something physical afterwards, and not just another data file,"" he adds. Having physical photos to hold is also something that Steven López from the US highlights as an advantage of analogue photography. The 33-year-old is travelling through Central America to document the last traces of Mayan culture and always carries a 35mm analogue camera with him. ""Photography and especially analogue photography is just the best way to document and experience cultures. Every time I get back from travelling and get the developed film back it's like Christmas!"", he tells the BBC. The community of analogue photography enthusiasts in Central America may be growing quickly, but the challenges are greater than in other places. ""It is really hard to get analogue cameras here and it is even harder to get them in good condition,"" explains 26-year-old Ronald Ottoniel, who went on the photo walk to buy new rolls of film and turn in others to be developed. And there are other hurdles, too. Fabriccio and Lucía explain that the process of buying and importing the chemicals needed to develop positive film has been extremely complicated because the import of these chemicals is closely monitored by the state and requires special permits, which has made it a painstakingly long ordeal. ""Many other labs don't offer the E-6 processing just because it's so complicated to import the chemicals,"" says Fabriccio. Their business may be expanding, but Fabriccio and Lucía are determined to make sure it does not lose the personal touch and passion which inspired it in the first place. Lucía explains how sometimes clients ""put little sweets into the packages they send us and sometimes we send a handwritten note back"". ""It's important to us that this is not a mass-producing business, but that every client is [treated as] an individual,"" she adds. Around the world, photo labs use large machines that develop the film almost completely automatically, but in the humble apartment of Fabriccio and Lucía, the process is very much ""hands-on"". For colour and positive (E-6) film the temperature of the chemicals and the time the film is exposed to them has to be exact, otherwise, the entire film roll will turn out badly. ""The beginning was definitely not easy with this entire process, but after developing over 800 film rolls these processes come like second nature to us,"" recalls Fabriccio. ""But the first time we developed the positive films, the E-6 process, we were so nervous because we had invested so much in the chemicals and the roll. But when it came out well and we were able to see these lively colours of the positive film it's always very exciting,"" he adds. Another indispensable member of the Arca Film Lab is Toto, the four-month-old cat that is, according to Fabriccio and Lucía, in charge of quality control and roves around during the entire development process. The developed film rolls are then transferred from the kitchen to the bathroom, as it is the most dust-free space in the house. There they dry, to be later scanned in a high-resolution Nikon scanner, which Fabriccio says is the highest-resolution film scanner in Central America. Fabriccio and Lucía have now also expanded to El Salvador, where they regularly collect and sell film rolls. The young couple remains ambitious and in the future, they say they hope to establish a strong relationship with CineStill and Eastman Kodak andto expand to developing cine film rolls, which would include a complicated process known as ECN-2. ""It is my dream to revitalise the classical cinematography scene here in Central America! We have so much talent expertise and enthusiasm to offer the world. (...) with Arca Film Lab we have started a movement that we want to push further and further,"" says Fabriccio. All photos by Fritz Pinnow and subject to copyright."

The inauguration ceremony was overshadowed by recrimination from the international community and Venezuelan opposition leaders. Rewards have also been offered for information leading to the arrest and or conviction of Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello. A new reward of up to $15m for Defence Minister Vladimir Padrino has also been offered. The UK also issued sanctions on 15 top Venezuelan officials, including judges, members of the security forces and military officials. The Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office said those sanctioned were responsible for ""undermining democracy, the rule of law, and human rights violations"". Foreign Secretary David Lammy went on to describe Maduro's regime as ""fraudulent"". Also on Friday, the EU said it was extending ""restrictive measures"" against Venezuela because of ""the lack of progress... leading to the restoration of democracy and the rule of law"". The bloc also sanctioned a further 15 Venezuelan officials. Canada also imposed fresh sanctions in what Foreign Minister Mélanie Joly called Maduro's ""shameless actions"". Joly said Canada ""will not tolerate the erosion of the democratic process or the repression of citizens seeking to express their rights"". Maduro and his government have repeatedly denounced many of the allegations made by Western countries and opposition leaders. The reward from the US cites narcotics and corruption charges dating back to 2020. In 2020, the US charged Maduro, and other senior officials in the country with ""narco-terrorism"". It accused them of flooding the US with cocaine and using drugs as a weapon to undermine the health of Americans. Maduro has rejected the accusations. The US also re-imposed oil sanctions last year, after temporarily easing them in the hope Maduro could be incentivised to hold free and fair elections. The Venezuelan president has blamed an economic collapse in his country on US-led sanctions he calls illegitimate and imperial. His critics blame corruption and economic mismanagement. On Friday, President Maduro took the oath of office, vowing his third six-year term in office would be a ""period of peace"". ""This new presidential term will be the period of peace, prosperity, equality, and the new democracy,"" he said. ""I swear by history, I swear by my life, and I will fulfil it,"" he added. The 28 July election results were widely rejected by the international community, including by Brazil and Colombia, some of Venezuela's left-wing neighbours. The inauguration itself was a tightly controlled affair. Most accredited Venezuelan media were not allowed inside and foreign journalists were not allowed in the country. Maduro has a few allies remaining including Iran, China and Russia but is increasingly isolated on the world stage. The Cuban and Nicaraguan presidents were the only leaders present at the inauguration. The 62-year-old was declared the winner of last July's presidential election but the opposition and many countries, including the US, rejected the result and recognised the exiled opposition candidate Edmundo González as the legitimate president-elect. González fled Venezuela in September and has been living in Spain, but this month he went on a tour of the Americas to rally international support. The Maduro government has issued an arrest warrant for him, offering a $100,000 reward for information leading to his detention. On Friday, the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres called for the release of all who have been ""arbitrarily detained"" since the elections.

The official results of July's election have been widely rejected by the international community, including neighbours Brazil and Colombia. The 62-year-old's inauguration comes one day after Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado was briefly arrested and then freed after addressing a protest rally. Information Minister Freddy Nanez dismissed the reports of Machado's detention as a ""media distraction"" after her team said she was ""violently intercepted"" in eastern Caracas. In a speech during his inauguration, Maduro said: ""I swear that this new presidential term will be one of peace, prosperity, equality and new democracy. I swear it by history, I swear it on my life. I will keep my word."" Maduro was declared the winner of July's presidential election by the official electoral commission.

It comes as Maduro was declared the winner of July's presidential election by Venezuela's National Electoral Council (CNE), which is closely aligned with the government. Machado, whom González replaced on the ballot after she was barred from running herself, has also been targeted. She went into hiding soon after the disputed elections, and was last seen in public in August before Thursday's rally.

Machado, 57, was ""violently intercepted"" in eastern Caracas and the motorcycle convoy in which she was riding was shot at, the opposition said, adding that she was forced to record several videos while being held. Venezuela's information minister Freddy Nanez dismissed reports of Machado's detention as a ""media distraction"". Maduro, 62, was declared the winner of last July's presidential election but the opposition and many countries, including the US, reject the result as fraudulent, and recognise the now-exiled opposition candidate Edmundo González as the legitimate president-elect.

Maduro's government has deployed thousands of police officers in Caracas, where the government-allied National Assembly plans to swear Maduro in for a third term in office. The opposition for its part urged its supporters to turn out in droves in an effort to thwart the ceremony. In the city of Valencia, police fired tear gas at protesters, according to Reuters. In western Caracas, 70-year-old Niegalos Payares told the news agency that ""I'm not afraid, I lost my fear a long time ago"". And in the city of Maracay, in central Venezuela, Roisa Gómez told a Reuters reporter that she was ""fighting for my vote, which I cast for Edmundo González. They cannot steal the election."" Maduro was declared the winner of the presidential election by the government-dominated National Electoral Council (CNE) but the CNE has to this day failed to provide detailed voting data to back up this claim. Earlier this month in Washington, González met US President Joe Biden, who said that Venezuela deserved a ""peaceful transfer of power"". In Panama, González deposited thousands of voting tallies which the opposition collected in the country's bank for safekeeping. The tallies have been the key evidence offered by the opposition to show that González, not Maduro won the election. With the help of official election witnesses, they managed to collect 85% of the tallies and uploaded them to the internet. Independent observers and media organisations which reviewed them say they show González beat Maduro by a landslide."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgz5l6l7k7o,'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life,2025-01-09T01:39:09.367Z,Norberto Paredes,"""They have already tortured me and repressed me, but they will not silence me. My voice is the only thing I have left."" This is how Juan, a young man aged around 20, begins his story. He alleges he was physically and psychologically tortured by Venezuelan security forces after being detained in connection with the presidential elections on 28 July. He was one of many hundreds of people arrested during protests after the electoral authorities - which are dominated by government loyalists - announced that the incumbent, Nicolás Maduro, had won. The National Electoral Council (CNE) did not make the voting tallies public and the Venezuelan opposition has described the official result as fraudulent, pointing out that the voting tallies it got hold of with the help of election observers suggest an overwhelming victory for its candidate, Edmundo González. Juan was released from prison in mid-November, days after Maduro called on judicial authorities to ""rectify"" any injustices in the arrests. The BBC spoke to him via video call. For his own safety, we have decided to withhold some of the details of his case and have changed his name. The young man alleges that many of the detainees are mistreated, given ""rotten food"" and that the most rebellious are locked up in ""torture chambers"". He showed the BBC documents and evidence that corroborate his story, which coincides with other testimony and with the complaints of non-governmental organisations. Juan, an anti-government political activist, says the election campaign and the days leading up to the election were ""marked by hope"" and many people were keen to vote for change. But the announcement of Maduro's victory shortly after midnight that Sunday turned what for many was a celebratory mood into confusion and anger. Thousands of Venezuelans took to the streets to protest against a result they decried as fraudulent. The opposition and international organisations say what followed was police repression which caused the deaths of more than 20 protesters. Maduro and some of his officials in turn have blamed the opposition, the ""extreme right"" and ""terrorist"" groups for the deaths. Gonzalo Himiob of Venezuelan non-governmental organisation Foro Penal says people were arrested for as little as ""celebrating the opposition's declaration of Edmundo González as the winner, or for posting something on social media"". ""We also have cases of people who were not even protesting, but for some reason they were near a protest and they were arrested,"" he added. Juan says that is what happened to him. The young political activist says he had been running an errand when a group of hooded men intercepted him, covered his face and beat him, accusing him of being a terrorist. ""They planted Molotov cocktails and petrol on me, and then took me to a detention centre,"" he continued. He was held in a prison in the interior of Venezuela for several weeks until he was transferred to Tocorón, a notorious high-security prison about 140km south-west of the capital, Caracas. There he would go through what he describes as the worst experience of his life. ""When we arrived at Tocorón, they stripped us, beat us, and insulted us. We were forbidden to raise our heads and look at the guards; we had to lower our heads to the floor,"" Juan recounts. Juan was assigned a small cell measuring three metres by three metres, which he had to share with five other people. There were six beds arranged in three bunk beds, and in one corner there was a septic tank and ""a pipe that served as a shower"". That was the bathroom. ""In Tocorón I felt more like I was in a concentration camp than in a prison,"" says the young man. He describes the beds as ""concrete tombs"" with a very thin mattress. ""They tortured us physically and psychologically. They wouldn't let us sleep, they were always coming to ask us to get up and line up,"" he explains. ""They would wake us up around 05:00 to line up behind the cell. The guards would ask us to show our passes and numbers."" He adds that at around 06:00 they would turn on the water for six minutes so they could bathe. ""Six minutes for six people and just one shower, with very cold water. If you were the last one there and you didn't have time to take off the soap, you were left covered in soap for the rest of the day,"" he says. Then, he adds, they waited for breakfast, which sometimes arrived at 06:00 and other times at 12:00. Dinner was sometimes at 21:00, and sometimes at 02:00. ""Apart from waiting for meals, there was nothing else to do. We could only walk around inside the small cell and tell stories. We also talked about politics, but in low voices, because if the guards heard us, they would punish us."" Juan says that many of his fellow inmates were depressed and acted like zombies. ""They gave us rotten food – meat scraps like you would give to chickens or dogs or sardines that had already expired."" Some detainees were routinely beaten or made to ""walk like frogs"" with their hands on their ankles, he says. He describes ""punishment cells"" where those considered the most rebellious would be sent, or those who dared to talk about politics or ask to make a phone call to relatives. Juan says that he had been in one of the punishment cells in Tocorón, and that he had only received one meal every two days. ""It's a very dark cell, one metre by one metre. I was very hungry. What kept me going was thinking about all the injustices that were happening and that one day I would get out of there,"" he says. Another torture cell is known as ""Adolfo's bed"", Juan says, named after the first person who died there. ""It's a dark, oxygen-deprived room the size of a vault. They put you in there for a few minutes until you can't breathe and you faint or start banging on the door in desperation. They put me in there and I lasted just over five minutes. I thought I was going to die,"" he recalls. The young man says that in this prison, inmates have 10 minutes to exercise outside three times a week, but many just stay in their cells. Foro Penal's Gonzalo Himiob describes the conditions in Tocorón as ""deplorable"" and says that detainees' fundamental rights, such as having access to a lawyer of the detainee's choosing, are being violated. ""They all have public defenders - the government knows that if it allows access to a private attorney who is not a public official, he or she can document all the due process violations that are occurring."" In October, United Nations (UN) experts reported serious human rights violations committed in the run-up to the presidential election and during the protests that followed, including political persecution, excessive use of force, enforced disappearances and extrajudicial executions by state security forces and related civilian groups. The International Criminal Court (ICC) is currently investigating the Venezuelan government for possible crimes against humanity. The Venezuelan government denies the accusations and says this investigation ""responds to the intention of instrumentalising the mechanisms of international criminal justice for political purposes"". The BBC requested an interview with the Public Prosecutor's Office about the allegations of mistreatment and torture of detainees, but had not received a response by the time of publication. Juan was released in November, but according to Foro Penal's figures, there were still 1,794 political prisoners in Venezuela as of 30 December. According to Juan, many of those detained in Tocorón have pinned their hopes on one date: that of the presidential inauguration on 10 January 2025. It is the day that opposition candidate Edmundo González, who has been living in exile in Spain, has said that he will return to Venezuela and take up office as president. He bases his claim to the presidency on official voting tallies the opposition managed to gather with help of election observers. These tallies, which amount to 85% of the total, have been uploaded to a website and reviewed by independent observers who say that they suggest an overwhelming victory for González. On Tuesday, US President Joe Biden met González and called him the ""true winner"" of the Venezuelan election. However, it is not clear how González, for whom the authorities have issued an arrest warrant, plans to enter Venezuela or who would swear him in given that the National Assembly is dominated by Maduro loyalists. Nevertheless, Juan says that the prisoners held in Tocorón are hoping against hope that Friday will see a change of government and their release from jail. Meanwhile, the Maduro government has labelled any talk of a political transition as ""a conspiracy"" and has threatened that anyone who backs a change of leader ""will pay for it"". Juan admits feeling a certain sense of guilt for being free when hundreds of his ""comrades are still suffering"" in prison. But he says he is determined to return to the streets to show his support for Edmundo González on 10 January. ""I no longer fear the Venezuelan government,"" he explains. ""They already accused me of the worst crimes, such as terrorism, even though I'm just a young man who has done nothing more than love his country and help those around him."" ""I'm not afraid,"" Juan repeats, before admitting that he has left some written testimony in a safe place ""in case something happens to me"". Illustrations by Daniel Arce-Lopez."

This has made it the frequent object of US attention. The United States supported its secession from Colombia in 1903, and secured a sovereign zone in which to build the Panama Canal - which remained under US control from 1914 until 1999. The US invaded in 1989 to depose a former ally, military ruler Manuel Noriega, over his repressive rule and use of the country as a centre for drug trafficking. Panama has the largest rainforest in the Western Hemisphere outside the Amazon Basin. However, it is for a feat of engineering, the canal connecting the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, that Panama is famous. Every year some 15,000 vessels use the Panama Canal - about 5% of global maritime trade and 40% of US container traffic. However, recently the canal has been hit by drought, as the canal region is receiving less rainfall than normal. It has introduced water-saving measures, meaning fewer ships can pass through each day. Read more country profiles

He originally ran for vice-president but stepped into the presidential race late after his running mate Ricardo Martinelli was disqualified for a money-laundering conviction. Mr Mulino, a conservative, campaigned on a promise to ""close"" the Darién Gap, a stretch of jungle crossed yearly by hundreds of thousands of migrants. He faces the challenge of how to make good on his promise to halt migration but also tackling the drought which has hampered Panama Canal operations. In December 2024, President Mulino denied a claim by US president-elect Donald Trump there were Chinese soldiers stationed at the canal, calling it ""nonsense"" and said there was ""absolutely no Chinese interference"".

In a social media post, Biden said Venezuela deserved a ""peaceful transfer of power"". González fled to Spain in September after turmoil following Venezuela's election, in which incumbent President Nicolás Maduro claimed victory - something disputed by González and many sections of the international community. The Maduro government reacted to the meeting with fury, calling it ""grotesque"" and accusing Biden of backing a violent anti-democratic project, Reuters news agency reports. Tension has been rising in the country as the day of the presidential inauguration - set for Friday - approaches, with both Maduro and González telling their supporters that they will be sworn in. The Maduro government, which has been in power since 2013, has deployed thousands of police and cut off major roads leading into the capital, Caracas, in what is widely seen as a tactic to deter any anti-government protests. But González, who has been living in exile in Spain since September, says he will defy an arrest warrant which has been issued for him and return to his homeland to take up office. However, he has not given any details as to how he plans to enter Venezuela, where the government is offering a $100,000 (£80,000) reward for information leading to his arrest. González has also not said how he plans to be sworn in when the National Assembly - the legislative body where the presidential oath is performed - is firmly in the hands of government loyalists. The opposition has nevertheless remained defiant and called on its supporters to take to the streets on Thursday. It has also rallied key international support with González's visit to the White House - the latest stop in a tour which has also seen him meet with the Argentine and Uruguayan presidents. In all three countries, he was met by cheering crowds of Venezuelans who held up signs reading ""freedom"". Almost eight million Venezuelans have left their homeland in recent years to escape economic hardship and political persecution, and many of them are living in Latin America and the US. Following Biden's meeting with González on Monday, the White House said it would be ""closely"" following the response Venezuela's authority will give to the opposition protests planned for Thursday. In the aftermath of July's election, thousands of Venezuelans who had expressed their anger at Maduro's claim of election victory were arrested and charged with ""terrorism"". Many remain behind bars. Opposition leader María Corina Machado, who was barred from running in the election and who threw her weight behind Edmundo González, told AFP news agency on Monday that all the Maduro government had left was fear. ""If we all come out, millions, how can a few hundred or a few thousand armed people [prevail] against 30 million Venezuelans?"" she asked. Referring to the voting tallies that the opposition has made public, she also insisted that the ""whole world knows"" González is ""the rightful president-elect"". The voting tallies - a detailed official breakdown of the votes from each polling station - have been at the centre of the dispute over who won the election. The government-aligned National Electoral Council declared Maduro the winner on 29 July, the day after the vote, but it has to this day failed to provide the tallies to back up its claim. With the help of accredited election witnesses, the opposition managed to collect and publish more than 80% of the voting tallies. Independent observers and media, including US outlets the New York Times and CNN, have reviewed the tallies and say they suggest that Edmundo González won the election with 67% of the votes, compared to Maduro's 30%. In December, the UN Human Rights Committee ordered Venezuela ""to refrain from destroying"" the voting tallies."

A first group of 75 soldiers arrived on Friday and another 75 on Saturday, all drafted from the military police, according to Guatemala's government. A state of emergency has been in place across the Caribbean nation for months as the government battles violent gangs that have taken control of much of the capital Port-au-Prince. The forces are in Haiti to boost a United Nations-backed security mission led by Kenya that has so far failed to prevent violence from escalating. Kenya sent nearly 400 police officers in June and July last year to help combat the gangs. This was the first tranche of a UN-approved international force that will be made up of 2,500 officers from various countries. A small number of forces from Jamaica, Belize and El Salvador are also in Haiti as part of the mission and the US is the operation's largest funder. In March 2024, armed gangs stormed Haiti's two biggest prisons, freeing around 3,700 inmates. The Ouest Department - a region including Port-au-Prince - was originally put under a state of emergency on 3 March, after escalating violence gripped the capital. Chronic instability, dictatorships and natural disasters in recent decades have left Haiti the poorest nation in the Americas. In 2021, President Jovenel Moïse was assassinated by unidentified gunmen in Port-au-Prince. Since then the country has been wracked by economic chaos, little functioning political control and increasingly violent gang warfare."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0rne2d540lo,Brazil ex-official returns toilet she had removed from office,2025-01-04T09:18:18.753Z,Ruth Comerford,"A former city councillor in Brazil has returned a toilet and two sinks she had removed from her office after losing a bid for re-election. Footage of one of Janaína Lima's employees hauling away the facilities was posted online as her tenure as Sao Paulo councilwoman ended. ""I decided to donate the equipment I acquired with my own resources to the chamber,"" she said in statement on X, following a social media backlash. ""Obviously, neither I nor my advisers need a toilet."" CCTV cameras caught employees in her office removing the facilities that were installed when she took office eight years ago. In a statement posted on social media, Lima said the bathroom renovation was paid for with her own money and therefore not an asset belonging to the council. Lima said she had followed the guidance of the legal department, that had indicated that all personally installed resources should be removed. She told Brazilian media outlet G1 the hydraulics in the building are ""sensitive"". The 41-year-old added that other fixtures she had bought for the office - such as a glass partition and industrial-style light fittings - would remain in place for her successor. Lima served as a councillor for the New Party until 1 January. Adrilles Jorge, of the Brazilian Labour Party, took over Lima's old office after the 2024 elections. At his inauguration, Jorge quipped to G1 that his team would ""use a communal potty"" until the situation is resolved. ""I visited the office and thought the architecture was brilliant. But she took everything out,"" he said. ""They even took out the toilet and the sink. She didn't say [that she was going to take them out]. And it's something that neither she would say, nor would I ask."" The new president of the House, Ricardo Teixeira said ""appropriate measures"" would be taken."

The president said his visit to the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station reaffirmed Chile's own claim to sovereignty over part of the Antarctic. ""This is a milestone for us,"" Boric said in footage shown on Chilean television, before adding ""it's the first time a Chilean president has come to the South Pole and talked about Chile's Antarctic mission"". Boric travelled with a group of scientists and several cabinet members, including ministers for the armed forces and the environment, his office said. Boric said his visit underlined Chile's determination to play a key role in scientific projects in the area, especially those involving climate change. In a statement, the government said research centres, universities, diplomats and the armed forces had united to ensure that Chile becomes the world's gateway to the Antarctic. Leftist President Gabriel Boric won Chile's presidential election in 2021 to become the country's youngest ever leader, at 35 years of age. Only two other world leaders had visited the South Pole before Boric: the prime ministers of New Zealand and Norway. Several countries, including Chile, the UK, France, Norway, Australia, New Zealand and Argentina, have laid claim to parts of Antarctica and many more have a presence there. Antarctica is not a country: it has no government and no indigenous population. Instead, the entire continent is set aside as a scientific preserve. The Antarctic Treaty, which came into force in 1961, enshrines an ideal of intellectual exchange. The Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station is named after Roald Amundsen - the Norwegian explorer who led the first expedition to the South Pole - and also Robert Scott, the UK explorer whom Amundsen beat to the pole in 1911. Scott and four companions died on the return leg of their trek after being caught in a blizzard."

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8dq8n1jn26o,Five charged in connection with Liam Payne's death,2024-12-30T18:56:45.598Z,David Mercer and Vanessa Buschschlüter,"Five people have been charged in connection with the death of One Direction singer Liam Payne in Argentina, the authorities there say. The 31-year-old star died on 16 October after falling from the third-floor balcony of a hotel in Buenos Aires. The hotel's manager, Gilda Martin, and its receptionist, Esteban Grassi, as well as Payne's friend Roger Nores have been charged with manslaughter, Argentina's prosecutor's office says. Ezequiel Pereyra - who also worked at the hotel - and Braian Paiz, a waiter, have been charged with supplying drugs. Under Argentina's legal system, the prosecutor's office gathers evidence which it then presents to a judge, who has to decide whether to proceed to trial. According to a statement released by the prosecutor's office, Judge Laura Bruniard already took the decision to proceed to the next stage on Friday. The defendants' lawyers can appeal against that decision. If their appeals are not successful, the trial phase starts. In court documents, Judge Bruniard listed the charges against the five suspects, who are referred to by their initials, as is the custom in court documents at this stage of the proceedings. Judge Bruniard said that she did not think that Liam Payne's friend, the hotel manager and the receptionist ""had planned or wanted the death of Payne"" but that their actions had created a ""risk"" to his life. If found guilty, the three could face sentences of between one and five years in prison. The sentence for supplying drugs is more severe and ranges between four and 15 years in jail. Judge Bruniard has ordered the two accused of supplying the drugs be remanded in custody. They have been summoned to appear within 24 working hours. Fernando Madeo Facente, the lawyer representing Braian Paiz, told the BBC that he had advised his client not to hand himself in. He said that Braian Paiz posed no flight risk and had in no way hindered the investigation. To the contrary, he had handed over his mobile phone containing chats with Liam Payne to the authorities willingly. The lawyer argued that holding Braian Paiz in pre-trial detention would therefore be completely unnecessary and over the top. He also argued that the prosecution had gone too far when it had accused his client of selling drugs to Payne. Mr Madeo Facente said that his client and Payne had spent time together ""during which they talked and did a lot of things, in private"". ""And one of those things they did was to consume drugs,"" the lawyer said. But he insisted that no money had been exchanged and that allegations to the contrary were ""completely false"" and lacking in evidence. He also emphatically rejected articles in the Argentine media which had described his client as ""Liam Payne's dealer"". In November, the prosecutor's office said toxicology tests revealed traces of alcohol, cocaine and a prescription antidepressant in Payne's body. A post-mortem examination determined his cause of death as ""multiple trauma"" and ""internal and external haemorrhage"", as a result of the fall from the hotel balcony. According to the prosecutor's office, medical reports also suggested Payne may have fallen in a state of semi or total unconsciousness. The prosecutor's office said this ruled out the possibility of a conscious or voluntary act by Payne, and they had concluded the singer did not know what he was doing nor have any comprehension of his actions. Speaking to US celebrity news outlet TMZ after Payne's death, Roger Nores said he was a ""very good friend"" of the singer and they had spent time together on the day the star died. He said Payne ""seemed playful and happy"" when he left him about an hour before the musician fell from the balcony. After Payne's death, police found substances in his hotel room and objects and furniture that had been damaged. Hotel staff had made two calls to emergency services saying they had a guest who had taken ""too many drugs and alcohol"", and was ""trashing the entire room"", it was previously reported. Payne became one of the most recognisable names in pop after appearing on The X Factor and rising to fame with the boyband One Direction in the 2010s before the band went on an indefinite hiatus in January 2016. The singer's funeral was held in Amersham, Buckinghamshire, last month. His former bandmates Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Niall Horan and Zayn Malik were among the mourners, alongside Payne's girlfriend Kate Cassidy and his former partner Cheryl, with whom he shares a son."

President Christine Carla Kangaloo issued the declaration on the advice of Prime Minister Keith Rowley, who had been under growing pressure to take action over worsening crime figures. The twin-island republic has one of the highest homicide rates in Latin America and the Caribbean, with a record murder tally of more than 620 this year so far in a population of 1.5 million people. Organised crime is responsible for the majority of the murders, many of them linked to the international drug trade. According to the US state department, the country's close proximity to Venezuela, porous borders and direct transportation routes to Europe and North America make it ""a prime location for narcotics trans-shipment"". In the latest violent incident, five men were shot dead in a shop in the poverty-stricken Laventille area on Sunday. Police believe the killings were in reprisal for the murder of a prominent gang member the previous day. Under the state of emergency, police will have the authority to arrest people on suspicion of involvement in crimes. They will also have the power to ""search and enter both public and private premises as necessary"". The prime minister's office issued a statement saying the intention was to ""address individuals who pose a threat to public safety, particularly those involved in criminal activities and the illegal use of firearms"". However, it added that there were no plans to impose a curfew. It is unclear how the state of emergency will affect Trinidad's world-renowned Carnival, which is set to culminate in a massive street parade on the Monday and Tuesday before Ash Wednesday in early March. The event is a major tourist attraction which brings in tens of thousands of visitors from overseas, but heightened security measures could put a damper on the festivities. The move comes as Trinidad and Tobago gears up for a general election, which must be held by August 2025. Rowley's governing People's National Movement party, in power since September 2015, faces a strong challenge from the opposition United National Congress, led by former Prime Minister Kamla Persad-Bissessar."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c623lerlr19o,Three dead in suspected Christmas cake poisoning,2024-12-28T22:39:06.131Z,Sofia Ferreira Santos,"Arsenic has been found in the blood of one of three women who died after eating a Christmas cake in a suspected poisoning in Brazil, a police chief has told local media. The highly toxic substance was also identified in the blood test results of a 10-year-old boy and the woman who made the cake - both of whom are still in hospital. Five members of the same family fell ill after eating the cake at a gathering in Torres, in the southern Rio Grande do Sul state, on Monday afternoon. Police have sent the cake for testing, and said several out-of-date food items were also found during a search at the woman's house. They added that it is not yet clear whether the suspected poisoning was intentional. Test results from the cake are expected to be available by next week, according to local media. On Friday, police requested for the body of a man - the late husband of the woman who made the cake - to be exhumed. He died in September from food poisoning, but police said his death was deemed natural at the time. She is not considered a suspect in either of these cases at this time, and investigations are ongoing. Six out of seven people at the Christmas celebration ate the cake on Monday afternoon, including the woman who baked it. Police told Brazilian broadcasters that she is the only one believed to have eaten two slices of her homemade cake, and her tests returned the highest levels of arsenic. Speaking to local media, police chief Marcos Vinicius Veloso said some of the family members complained that the cake had a ""peppery"" taste. The family then began to experience symptoms such as vomiting and diarrhoea, and five of them sought medical help at the Nossa Senhora dos Navegantes Hospital at around 01:00 local time (04:00 GMT) on Tuesday. Hours later, two sisters died from cardiac arrest, the hospital said. They have been named in local media as Maida Berenice Flores da Silva, 58, and Tatiana Denize Silva dos Santos, 43. The third victim, whose blood test presented traces of arsenic, died later on Tuesday evening from ""shock after food poisoning"", the hospital said. She has been named locally as 65-year-old Neuza Denize Silva dos Anjos. Arsenic is a metallic element that occurs naturally. Its inorganic form is highly toxic and classified as a category one carcinogen by the EU - meaning it's known to cause cancer in humans. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), people are exposed to elevated levels of inorganic arsenic through drinking contaminated water or using it in food preparation, as well as irrigation of crops, industrial processes and smoking tobacco. Because arsenic exists in soil, small amounts can get into food, though in general these levels are so low that they are not considered a cause for concern. It is also used, albeit in limited cases, in pesticides and pharmaceuticals."

Two journalists and a police officer were reportedly shot dead, while others were wounded in Tuesday's attack in the general hospital in the capital Port-au-Prince. The site had been recaptured by Haiti's government in July, after being occupied and destroyed by gangs. The Viv Ansanm gang alliance, which controls much of the city, has owned up to the attack. Pictures posted online appear to show several people injured or dead inside the building. Journalists were waiting for the arrival of Health Minister Lorthe Blema when the shooting began. Journalists Markenzy Nathoux and Jimmy Jean were killed during the attack, Robest Dimanche, spokesman for the Online Media Collective, told AFP news agency. Other journalists were wounded, he added. An officer was also killed, police spokesman Lionel Lazarre told AFP. ""It felt like a terrible movie,"" Dieugo André, a photojournalist who witnessed the violence, was quoted as saying by The Haitian Times. ""I have the blood of several injured journalists on my clothes."" In an online video claiming the attack, the Viv Ansanm gang alliance said it had not authorised the reopening of the hospital, which they occupied and destroyed in March. The head of Haiti's presidential transitional council, Leslie Voltaire, said: ""We express our sympathy to all the victims' families, in particularly to the Haiti National Police and all the journalists' associations. ""We guarantee them that this act will not remain without consequences."" People in Haiti continue to suffer with unbearable levels of gang violence, despite the installation of a new transition government in April and the deployment of an international force led by Kenyan police officers six months ago. Haiti has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Moïse. An estimated 85% of Port-au-Prince is still under gang control. The UN says that as many as 5,000 people have been killed in violence in Haiti this year alone, and the country is now on the verge of collapse."

Four people are known to have died, and more than 10 are missing after the central span of the bridge linking Tocantins and Maranhão states gave way on Sunday afternoon. It is not clear if or how much the chemicals have leaked from their containers, but diving operations in the river have been halted while the situation is assessed. Dramatic video filmed by a local councillor who went to the bridge to draw attention to cracks in it showed the start of the collapse. Councillor Elias Junior said he never expected the bridge to actually collapse when he was there and was ""in shock"". Eight vehicles plunged into the river, including the three lorries containing chemicals. People in the cities of Estreito and Aguiarnopolis, on either side of the river, have been told to avoid collecting water from it. Rescue operations are being carried out from boats. Four bodies have been recovered, including the female driver of one of the trucks and an 11-year-old girl, the fire service said. One man was rescued alive from the water on Sunday. The Juscelino Kubitschek de Oliveira bridge - which is more than half a kilometre (1,600ft) long - was built in the 1960s and is the main link between the two states across the Tocantins river.  "

Her mother, Venda, desperately hopes it will alleviate the acute malnutrition the emaciated young girl is suffering from. Shaina is one of 760,000 children who are on the brink of famine in Haiti. Terrified of the gang warfare raging in her neighbourhood, for weeks Venda was too frightened to leave her home to seek treatment for her daughter. Now that she has made it to the paediatric ward, she hopes it is not too late for Shaina. ""I want to get proper care for my child, I don't want to lose her,"" she says tearfully. Haiti has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Moïse, and now an estimated 85% of the capital is under gang control. Even inside the hospital, Haitians are not safe from the fighting, which the UN says has killed 5,000 people this year alone and left the country on the verge of collapse. The hospital's medical director explains that the previous day, police clashed with gang members in the emergency ward among terrified patients. The victims of the violence are everywhere. One ward is full of young men with gunshot wounds. Pierre is one of them. He says he was walking home from work when he was caught in the crossfire of one street battle, with a bullet ripping through his collar bone. ""I think if the government were more stable and had put in place better youth programmes, they would not get involved in the gangs,"" he says of the young men who make up a large proportion of the groups terrorising the capital. To combat the growing violence, the UN Security Council authorised the establishment of a Multinational Security Support Mission (MSS) in October 2023. Funded primarily by the US, the Kenyan-led force deployed to Haiti six months ago tasked with restoring law and order. On a patrol in downtown Port-au-Prince, the ferocity of the gang violence is clear. Kenyan officers drive along the streets in heavily armoured personnel carriers (APC) through once bustling areas of the capital that now lie deserted. Shops and houses are boarded up. Burnt out cars and debris are piled high along the side streets - barricades built by the gangs to block access. The convoy weaves its way through the rubble when suddenly it comes under fire. Bullets slam into the APC's armour as the Kenyan police shoot back with their assault rifles through gun ports in the vehicle's walls. After nearly an hour of back-and-forth gunfire, the convoy moves on. But it is not long before there are signs of more horrific gang violence. A human body burns in the middle of the street. One of the Kenyan police in our APC says he suspects it was a gang member cornered and killed by a rival group, his body set alight to send a gruesome warning. The Kenyan officers on our patrol are by now well accustomed to seeing this sort of brutality on the streets of Port-au-Prince, but they also tell us they are exhausted. Four hundred officers arrived in June - but they are hugely outnumbered. In July, Haiti's government estimated there were 12,000 armed gang members in the country. The Kenyans were promised additional personnel. When the UN authorised the mission, a force of 2,500 was envisioned, but that support, which was supposed to arrive in November, has yet to materialise. Despite the situation, the force's leadership remains optimistic. Commander Godfrey Otunge is under pressure from the Kenyan government to make a success of this mission. The mission commander says there is ""overwhelming support"" for the MSS in Haiti. ""The population are demanding that our team extend and go to other places and pacify,"" he says. The uphill struggle they face is clear at a former Haitian police station, which had been occupied by a gang but has now been re-taken by the Kenyan forces. It is still entirely surrounded by gangs and, as officers head up to the roof, they come under sniper fire. The Kenyan officers shoot back while urging everyone to remain low. The Kenyan officers say some of their much-delayed additional forces will arrive by the end of this year, bringing their total to 1,000. And the support is urgently needed. There are areas in Port-au-Prince which are under such tight gang control they are virtually impenetrable for the police. In one such area, Wharf Jérémie, almost 200 civilians were killed by a single gang over the space of one weekend earlier in December. In total, as many as 100 gangs are estimated to be operating in the Port-au-Prince area, with boys as young as nine joining their ranks. And the problem only appears to be growing. According to the UN children's agency, Unicef, the number of children recruited to the gangs has soared by 70% in a year. One of the gang leaders to whom they flock is Ti Lapli, whose real name is Renel Destina. As head of the Gran Ravine gang, he commands more than 1,000 men from his fortified headquarters high above Port-au-Prince. Gangs like his have exacerbated an already dire situation in Haiti, and are known to slaughter, rape and terrorise civilians. Gran Ravine is infamous for carrying out kidnappings for ransom, a practice which has earned Ti Lapli a place on the FBI's wanted list. Ti Lapli tells us that he and his gang members ""love our country a lot"" - but when pressed on the rapes and murders gangs like his inflict on civilians, he claimed his men ""do things they weren't supposed to do [to members of rival gangs] because the same is done to us"". The reason children join Gran Ravine is simple, he says: ""The government doesn't create any jobs, it's a country with no economic activity whatsoever. We are living on trash, it's basically a failed state."" He failed to acknowledge the strangulating impact gangs like his have on Haiti's economy. Often afraid to leave their homes for work, civilians are regularly extorted for money, too. With 700,000 residents forced to flee their homes due to the violence inflicted by groups such as Gran Ravine, the capital's schools have become camps for internally displaced people. Negociant is one of those who has had to seek shelter. She sits with her five children, squeezed onto the small section of a school balcony they now call home. ""Just weeks ago I was living in my own house,"" she says. ""But gangs took over my neighbourhood."" She explains that she left for an area of the city called Solino, until that too was overrun by gangs and she fled along with hundreds of other people. ""Today, again, I'm on the run to save my life and my children,"" she says."

The children were taken into care on Friday when police raided a farm used by the Lev Tahor movement, which is under investigation in several countries for serious sexual offences. Interior Minister Francisco Jimenez said they were allegedly being abused by a member of the sect. But on Sunday, sect members broke into a care centre where they were being held in an attempt to get them back, leading to scuffles with police. The Lev Tahor sect is known for extremist practices and imposing a strict regime on its followers. It advocates child marriage, inflicts harsh punishments even for minor transgressions and requires women and girls as young as three years old to completely cover up with robes. The sect accuses the Guatemalan authorities of religious persecution. The community settled in Mexico and Guatemala between 2014 and 2017. In 2022, members of the sect were arrested in a police operation in the southern Mexican state of Chiapas, but they were later freed for lack of evidence. The events began when police raided the sect's farm in Oratorio, south-east of Guatemala City, on Friday, taking the children into care. Prosecutors said there were suspicions of ""forced pregnancy, mistreatment of minors and rape"". But two days later, about 100 of the children's relatives - all members of the sect - gathered outside the centre where they were being held to call for their return. Some sect members then forced open the gate and tried to abduct the children and adolescents sheltered there, the Attorney General's Office said. But the children were intercepted by the authorities and put into a white minibus, local media reported. With police help, the centre ""managed to locate and protect everyone again"", the Attorney General's Office added. Officials had previously tried to check on the children's wellbeing, but were prevented from entering the farm by sect members. Authorities estimate that the community is made up of about 50 families residing in Guatemala, the US, Canada and other countries. The Jewish Community of Guatemala has issued a statement disowning the sect, describing it as foreign to its own organisation. It expressed support for the Guatemalan authorities in carrying out necessary investigations ""to protect the lives and integrity of minors and other vulnerable groups that may be at risk""."

Brazilian businessman Luiz Claudio Galeazzi, who was piloting the plane, was killed in the crash alongside his wife, three daughters and other family members, a statement from his company said. The small plane reportedly hit the chimney of a building, as well as a house and a shop as it fell. Local authorities say 17 people on the ground were injured in the accident, including two in a serious condition. Mr Galeazzi, 61, was taking his family on a trip to Jundiaí, in the São Paulo state, according to reports in Brazilian media. All 10 victims of the crash were members of Mr Galeazzi's family, Rio Grande do Sul state governor Eduardo Leite told a press conference. He added that the plane had taken off in unfavourable weather conditions. The plane reportedly flew for 3km (1.8 miles) before falling into the urban area of the city just minutes after take-off on Sunday morning. ""At the time, it was revving up. You could see that it was accelerating a lot,"" an eyewitness, Nadia Hansen, told Reuters news agency. ""Then there was a bang as it hit the building and then it passed close to my house and then it fell, and I thought it had dropped in front of the house,"" she said. Pictures from the scene show emergency workers attending to the smoking wreckage among debris from badly damaged buildings. Mr Galeazzi was the chief executive of Galeazzi & Associados, a corporate restructuring and crisis management firm based in São Paulo. The company issued a statement on LinkedIn, paying tribute to the 61-year-old. ""Luiz Galeazzi will be eternally remembered for his dedication to his family and for his remarkable career as the leader of Galeazzi & Associados,"" the statement said. ""We also sympathize with all those affected by the accident in the region,"" it said, adding that it would co-operate with investigations into the accident. The plane crashed near the centre of Gramado, hitting a house, a furniture store and a hotel, according to Brazilian media. State governor Mr Leite said the cause of the accident was being investigated by the Aeronautical Accident Investigation and Prevention Center (Cenipa). ""The entire state is mobilized here to provide the necessary assistance,"" he told reporters at the scene. Gramado is a popular tourist destination, known for hosting events during the festive period. The region was severely hit in May this year by unprecedented flooding, which claimed dozens of lives and displaced around 150,000 people from their homes."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86w44x083zo,The drug-trafficking Rio gangsters who see themselves as God's 'soldiers of crime',2024-12-21T01:13:57.174Z,"Lebo Diseko, Global Religion Correspondent & Julia Carneiro","When police in Rio de Janeiro seize blocks of cocaine and bundles of marijuana they may well find them branded with a religious symbol – the Star of David. This is not a reference to the Jewish faith, but to the belief of some Pentecostal Christians that the return of Jews to Israel will lead to the Second Coming of Christ. The gang selling these branded drugs is the Pure Third Command, one of Rio's most powerful criminal groups, with a reputation both for making its opponents disappear, and for fanatical evangelical Christianity. They took control of a group of five favelas in the north of the city – now known as the Israel Complex – after one of their leaders had what he believed was a revelation from God, says theologian Vivian Costa, author of the book, Evangelical Drug Dealers. She says the gangsters see themselves as ""soldiers of crime"", with Jesus as ""the owner"" of the territory they dominate. Controversially, some have dubbed them ""Narco-Pentecostals"". One man who has experience of crime and religion – though in his case, not at the same time – is Pastor Diego Nascimento, who became a Christian after hearing the gospel from a gangster holding a gun. Looking at him, it's hard to believe that this boyish looking 42-year-old Wesleyan Methodist minister with a ready smile and dimples, was once a member of Rio's notorious Red Command crime gang and managed its activities in the city's Vila Kennedy favela. Four years in prison for drug dealing weren't enough to make him give up crime. But when he became addicted to crack cocaine his standing in the gang plummeted. ""I lost my family. I practically lived on the street for almost a year. I went so far as to sell things from my house to buy crack,"" he says. It was at that point, when he was at rock bottom, that a well-known drug dealer in the favela summoned him. ""He started preaching to me, saying there was a way out, that there was a solution for me, which was to accept Jesus,"" he recalls. The young addict took this advice and began his journey to the pulpit. Pastor Nascimento still spends time with criminals, but now it is through his work in prisons, where he helps people turn their lives around, as he did himself. Despite having been converted by a gangster, he regards the idea of religious criminals as a contradiction in terms. ""I don't see them as evangelical believers,"" he says. ""I see them as people who are going down the wrong path and have a fear of God because they know that God is the one who guards their lives. ""There is no such thing as combining the two, being an evangelical and a thug. If a person accepts Jesus and follows the Biblical commandments, that person cannot be a drug dealer."" Evangelical Christianity will, by some predictions, overtake Catholicism as Brazil's biggest religion by the end of the decade. As it has grown, the charismatic Pentecostal movement has particularly resonated with people living in the gang-ridden favelas, and now some of those gangs are drawing on elements of the faith they grew up with to wield power. One accusation made against them is that they are using violence to suppress Afro-Brazilian faiths. Christina Vital, a sociology professor at Rio's Fluminense Federal University, says Rio's poor communities have long been living ""under siege"" from criminal gangs, and this is now affecting their freedom of religion. ""In the Israel Complex, people with other religious beliefs cannot be seen to practise them publicly. It's not an exaggeration to speak of religious intolerance in that territory."" Vital says Afro-Brazilian Umbanda and Candomblé religious houses have been shut down in surrounding neighbourhoods too, with gangsters sometimes drawing messages on the walls such as ""Jesus is the Lord of this place."" Followers of Afro-Brazilian faiths have long faced prejudice, and drug dealers are not the only people who have targeted them. But Dr Rita Salim, who heads the Rio police Department for Racial and Intolerance Crimes, says threats and attacks by narco-gangs have a particularly powerful impact. ""These cases are more serious because they are imposed by a criminal organisation, by a group and its leader, who imposes fear on the whole territory it dominates."" She notes that an arrest warrant has been issued for the man thought to be the number one crime boss in the Israel Complex, for allegedly ordering armed men to attack an Afro-Brazilian temple in another favela. While allegations of religious extremism in Rio's favelas first gained attention in the early 2000s, the problem has ""increased dramatically"" in recent years, according to Marcio de Jagun, co-ordinator of Religious Diversity at Rio's City Hall. Jagun, who is a babalorixá (high priest) of the Candomblé religion, says the issue is now a national one, with similar attacks seen in other Brazilian cities. ""This is a form of neo-Crusade,"" he says. ""The prejudice behind these attacks is both religious and ethnic, with outlaws demonising religions from Africa and claiming to banish evil in the name of God."" But religion and crime have long been intertwined in Brazil, says theologian Vivian Costa. In the past, gangsters would ask for protection from Afro-Brazilian deities and Catholic saints. ""If we look at the birth of the Red Command, or the birth of the Third Command, Afro religions [and Catholicism] have been there since their beginning. We see the presence of Saint George, the presence of [the Afro-Brazilian god] Ògún, the tattoos, the crucifixes, the candles, the offerings. ""That is why to call it Narco-Pentecostalism is to reduce that relationship that is so historic and traditional between crime and religion. I prefer to call it 'Narco-Religiosity'."" Whatever one calls this mix of faith and criminality, one thing seems clear: it jeopardises a right that is enshrined in Brazil's constitution – that of religious freedom. And it is yet one more way in which violent drug traffickers cause harm to the communities forced to live under their rule. "

They were found in an expedition to Alto Mayo - which includes the Amazon rainforest - by scientists from the non-profit organisation Conservation International and members of local indigenous groups. Up to 48 other new species may also have been found, although further study will be needed to determine whether they are new, Conservation International says. ""Discovering so many new species of mammals and vertebrates is really incredible, especially in such a human-influenced landscape,"" said Trond Larsen, senior director at Conservation International. Alto Mayo is a protected area in northern Peru with multiple ecosystems and Indigenous territories. It has a relatively high population density, putting pressure on environmentalism through deforestation and agricultural expansion, Conservation International said. Yulisa Tuwi, an Awajún woman who assisted with the research, said the report ""allows the Awajún to protect our culture, natural resources and our territory"", as it gives them a better understanding of the ecosystems. ""[The Awajún] have extensive traditional knowledge about the forests, animals and plants they live side-by-side with,"" Mr Larsen said. The expedition also found a new species of dwarf squirrel, eight types of fish, three amphibians and 10 types of butterfly. This ""blob-headed"" fish is a new discovery to science, but the Indigenous Awajún people who helped with the expedition were already aware of its existence. The fish scientists were particularly shocked by its enlarged head - something they had never seen before. This dwarf squirrel measures just 14cm (5.5in), half the length of an average grey squirrel in the UK, which ranges from 24 to 29cm, according to the UK Squirrel Accord. ""[It] fits so easily in the palm of your hand. Adorable and beautiful chestnut-brown colour, very fast,"" Larsen said. ""It jumps quickly and hides in the trees."" Scientists discovered a new species of spiny mouse - named after the especially stiff guard hairs found on their coats, which function similar to the spines of a hedgehog. They also found a new ""amphibious mouse"", which has partially webbed feet and eats aquatic insects. It belongs to a group of semi-aquatic rodents considered to be among the rarest in the world, with the few species known to exist only spotted a handful of times by scientists."

Canserbero, who had been named best Spanish-language rapper by Rolling Stone magazine, was drugged and stabbed to death by his manager, Natalia Améstica. Améstica and her brother then threw his body from a 10th floor window. The five people sentenced on Tuesday have been found guilty of helping the siblings stage the crime scene so Canserbero's murder appeared a suicide. They have been given jail terms ranging between 15 and 20 years. Natalia Améstica and her brother Guillermo were already sentenced to 25 years in prison back in February for murder. The death on 19 January 2015 of Canserbero, whose real name was Tirone González, shocked the Venezuelan rap scene. It was ruled at the time that the 26-year-old star had killed his friend Carlos Molnar in a knife fight before jumping from a window. But in December 2023, Natalia Améstica confessed to stabbing both Molnar and Canserbero. In a video statement released by the Venezuelan attorney general last year she recounted what had happened on the night. Natalia Améstica claims that she was angry with the rapper after she had learned that Canserbero no longer wanted her as his manager. She described how Canserbero came to her apartment in the Venezuelan city of Maracay on 19 January 2015. He was accompanied by his friend Carlos Molnar, who was also Natalia Améstica's long-term boyfriend. ""The chance arose to make them a tea,"" she explained in the video, adding that she spiked their beverage with a powerful tranquiliser. When her drugged partner Carlos Molnar entered the kitchen, she stabbed him in the neck, in the back and in the arm. Canserbero witnessed Améstica's attack on her boyfriend but, under the influence of the drugs Améstica had slipped him, he collapsed on the sofa. Améstica then proceeded to stab him twice. ""In desperation, I then called my brother Guillermo to help me resolve the situation,"" she said in the video confession. Her brother arrived with the three officers from Venezuela's intelligence agency, Sebin, who have now been sentenced. ""They finished arranging the scene in a way to make it look like a murder-suicide,"" according to Natalia Améstica. She said that the officers ""stabbed Carlos [Molnar] a few more times, my brother Guillermo stabbed him four times. The rest, the Sebin officials did"". ""Then we were told how to throw him out of the window to complete the murder-suicide scene,"" she said in her confession. Her brother Guillermo said that a forensic detective who arrived at the scene became suspicious, remarking that it appeared ""manipulated"". According to Guillermo Améstica, the forensic expert asked for a bribe of $10,000 (£7,880) in exchange for helping the siblings cover up the crime and to make it look like Canserbero had attacked Molnar before jumping out of the window. The fifth man sentenced on Tuesday is Marcos Pratolongo, a music impresario who provided security at some of Canserbero's concerts. At the time of his arrest, Venezuela's attorney general had said that Pratolongo was in possession of the keys to Canserbero's apartment, from which important evidence had disappeared. The attorney general posted on social media on Tuesday that Pratolongo had been found guilty of complicity in Canserbero's murder but did not provide further details of his role in the crime."

Osiel Cárdenas Guillén, 57, led Los Zetas until 2003, when he was cornered by Mexican soldiers near his hometown of Matamoros. Under his leadership, the group became one of the most powerful and brutal hit squads in the Mexican drug wars. US immigration officials handed Cárdenas over to Mexican police at the Otay border crossing, where he was quickly re-arrested and taken to El Altiplano maximum security jail in Mexico state. Mexican prosecutors said he had been arrested on charges of murder and organised crime dating back to his time as one of the most powerful drug lords in Mexico. Cárdenas Guillén made his criminal career in the Gulf drugs cartel in the 1990s, reportedly not shying away from having his allies killed to rise to the top, a practice which earned him the nickname of ""Mata Amigos"" (Spanish for ""killer of friends""). But what he became infamous for was recruiting members of Mexico's elite special forces and using them as hitmen and enforcers for the Gulf cartel. The law enforcers-turned-contract killers became known as Los Zetas. The brutal methods they used, such as decapitating and dismembering their victims, quickly spread terror through the north-eastern part of Mexico which was their stronghold. By the early 2000s, Cárdenas Guillén was one of the most wanted men in Mexico. Mexican security forces managed to apprehend him in his home state of Tamaulipas in 2003 after a bloody gun battle. Aware of the power the gang leader wielded in the area, the security forces quickly flew him to the capital, Mexico City, were he was put into pre-trial detention. In 2007, he was extradited to the US. There, he was charged not just with trafficking tonnes of cocaine into the US but also with threatening to assault and murder federal agents. He pleaded guilty in 2010 and was sentenced to 25 years in jail. Having served a large part of his sentence, he was released in August of 2024 from federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana, and handed over to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This paved the way for his deportation to Mexico on Monday. Mexican prosecutors said there were seven federal cases still open against Cárdenas Guillén and that he could be sentenced to a total of more than 700 years in prison if found guilty on all charges."

The 79-year-old appeared alongside his medical team at a news conference at Sírio-Libanês hospital in São Paulo. ""This here is not an interview, this is simply a session to say thanks. To thank, firstly, God, who has looked after me in a very generous manner,"" he said. Lula was taken to hospital on Monday after he had complained of a severe headache. Doctors performed a craniotomy on the president, a procedure in which part of the bone is surgically removed from the skull to treat the bleed and relieve the pressure. The bone is then replaced. The brain bleed, or intracranial haemorrhage, was caused by a blow to the head he sustained when he fell in his bathroom at the presidential residence in October, according to a hospital statement. ""Thank you very much for the prayers,"" Lula added on Sunday. ""And for those who only have hate, you're forgiven. I am here, alive, whole, and with more desire to work.""  On Tuesday, doctors said the president was in a stable condition following the surgery and was conscious. Lula was ""lucid"" and conversing with medical staff, they added. They also insisted that he had not sustained any brain injury and was not experiencing after-effects from the surgery. Asked when he would return to the capital, doctors had said that if everything went well, they expected Lula to be back in Brasilia ""next week"". While Lula was in hospital, Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin took on some of the president's commitments. The doctors said the bleeding was a result of the fall Lula had sustained in October. They explained that it was not unusual for problems from a blow to the head to appear ""months later"". Lula had slipped in the bathroom in the Alvorada Palace on 19 October and hit the back of his head. On Sunday, he explained he had been cutting his toe nails at the time and had been sitting down. He went on to have five stitches. On his doctors' advice, the president cancelled his planned trip to Russia for a summit of the Brics countries. He returned to full duties days later. Lula has been in power since January last year after narrowly beating the incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, in a bitterly fought election. During the election campaign, he often joked that he had ""the energy of a 30-year-old"". Additional reporting by Malu Cursino"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5y86vv0wneo,"Milei, Musk and Maga: Is Argentina influencing the US?",2024-12-13T22:33:31.861Z,Robert Plummer,"As Argentina's maverick libertarian President Javier Milei marks one year in office, his efforts to revive the economy are still a work in progress - but his policies are proving influential in the US. Milei came to power with a mission to cut state spending in a country that had been living beyond its means for years. Despite his tough austerity measures and a continued rise in poverty rates, he is still supported by just over half the population, according to a survey carried out earlier this month by the CB Consultora organisation. That level of popularity is similar to that of Donald Trump right now. Roughly half of US voters backed the president-elect in last month's presidential contest - and Trump has hailed Milei as a man who can ""make Argentina great again"". Meanwhile, tech billionaire Elon Musk, who looks set to play a key role in the incoming US administration, has also praised Milei, saying Argentina is ""experiencing a giant improvement"" under his leadership. But what is it that Trump and Musk see in Milei? And are they as close ideologically as is often assumed? Milei's biggest achievement so far, the one which is most prized by Argentines, is his success in cutting inflation. But he has caused a stir in the US because of his deregulation drive, which has been seized on by small-government activists keen to shrink the size of the state in Washington along the lines of what is happening in Buenos Aires. In Milei's initial package of measures, he slashed state subsidies for fuel and cut the number of government ministries by half. Now he is trying to force through plans for a mass sell-off of state-run companies, including the country's flagship airline Aerolineas Argentinas, which has already been privatised once before being renationalised in 2008. All this is music to the ears of Elon Musk, who is being tasked with similar cost-cutting initiatives under the banner of the so-called Department of Government Efficiency - a misleading name, since it is an advisory body, not an official government department. Musk and his co-leader in the department, fellow billionaire Vivek Ramaswamy, have said they want to slash federal regulations, oversee mass layoffs and shut down some agencies entirely. Musk has spoken of cutting federal government spending by $2tn (£1.6tn) - about one-third of annual expenditure. According to him, Milei is doing ""a fantastic job"" in Argentina by ""deleting entire departments"" - and he would like to follow suit in the US, with Trump's blessing. But long-time Latin America observers are sceptical. Monica de Bolle, senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics in Washington, says that ""taking inspiration from Milei to reduce the size of government doesn't make any sense"". ""The situation in Argentina is very particular to Argentina, because it was about the removal of decades of mismanagement of public resources. That has nothing to do with the US."" Ms de Bolle says Argentina had no choice but to take action, because government overspending was so excessive that the country was ""bursting into crisis every few years"". ""That is appropriate for Argentina, but for nobody else."" Marcelo J García, Buenos Aires-based director for the Americas at global consulting firm Horizon Engage, says Milei's decision to wield a chainsaw on the campaign trail as a sign of his approach to government was a ""masterpiece"" of political marketing that has ""captured the imagination of small-state activists across the globe"". But he argues that while Musk's own business interests would benefit from less government regulation, that's not necessarily what Trump wants. ""I'm not sure that the Trump platform is compatible with a Milei-type chainsaw small government,"" he told the BBC. He points out that Trump's policies ""require big government in some areas"", such as the building of border walls and mass deportations of illegal immigrants. ""You can't do those kinds of massive programmes with small government."" In Milei's view, infrastructure projects are best left to the private sector and have nothing to do with government. Milei and Trump are on the same side in the global culture wars, denouncing what they see as the ""woke agenda"". But in economic terms, their ideas are very different. Milei is a passionate free-trader, and Argentina is a member of the South American trading bloc Mercosur, which also includes Brazil, Paraguay, and Uruguay. While he is in favour of Mercosur's recent free-trade deal with the European Union, he doesn't like the way that the organisation refuses to let its individual member countries strike their own deals. As a result, he says Mercosur ""has ended up becoming a prison"". ""If the bloc is not a dynamic engine that facilitates trade, boosts investment and improves the quality of life of all the citizens of our region, what is the point of it?"" he said at the Mercosur summit in Uruguay earlier this month where the deal with the EU was signed. Trump also has beef with his own regional trade alliance, the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), but for reasons that are the opposite of Milei's. Trump wants to renegotiate the USMCA, a deal that he himself put together during his first term in office, as a way of protecting US manufacturing and safeguarding US jobs. He has even found a way of weaponising the alliance by threatening to impose a blanket 25% tariff on goods from both Canada and Mexico unless they secure their shared borders with the US. Monica de Bolle doubts that Trump shares Musk's enthusiasm for a smaller state: ""You can't be a populist nationalist and care about the size of government. So Trump doesn't care. He put Elon there because it's kind of fun to have someone there making noise."" The economic debate is set to run and run, in both the US and Argentina. But ultimately, if one half of your population supports you, it means the other half doesn't. Trump will have to deal with that after his inauguration on 20 January, but Milei is already having to cope with his own polarised population. As Marcelo J García sees it, Milei is a ""divisive leader"" who has made no attempt to win over his opponents. ""The other half of the country that did not support him will arguably never support him, no matter how well the economy does, because he doesn't want them to support him,"" he says. ""Leaders tend to want to be liked by everyone. That's not the case with Milei,"" he adds. In his view, this is a real weakness: ""You don't build a long-term sustainable political project if you don't move towards the people who didn't vote for you."" Milei's next big test of public opinion will come in October 2025, when Argentina holds midterm elections. That could prove crucial in deciding whether his small-government revolution determines the country's future - or whether, like previous attempts at reform, it runs out of steam."

Judge Edmundo Román Pinzón was hit by at least four bullets as he was driving out of the courthouse car park on Wednesday afternoon, local time. He was a senior judge who had been president of the highest court in the state of Guerrero, where Acapulco is located. The murder comes amid a surge in deadly attacks on officials in the violence-wracked southern state. Police have been speaking to witnesses and been gathering CCTV footage from the murder scene, but so far no arrests have been made in connection with the case. The security forces have also stepped up their activities in the resort town in order to catch those responsible. According to local paper El Sol de Acapulco, the judge had been in charge of the court which dealt with murders, kidnappings and car thefts. It is not yet known what the possible motive behind the murder may have been. The governor of Guerrero state said the crime demanded ""immediate justice"". The killing of the judge is the latest in a string of extremely violent attacks in Guerrero over the past weeks. Last month, the bodies of 11 people, including two children, were found inside a vehicle in the town of Chilpancingo, 100km (62 miles) north of Acapulco. Acapulco, once a popular beach resort, has not been spared, with rival gangs battling for control of the city's drugs market - and at times leaving mutilated bodies on beaches. "
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg3dl757w6o,"Meet Karol G, Colombia's Taylor Swift",2024-12-12T00:03:09.664Z,Catherine Ellis,"We have all heard of Taylor Swift, but what about Colombian singer Karol G? While Swift has dominated the headlines and concert ticket sales over recent years, it is actually the 33-year-old Latin American pop star whose videos are the most watched online. That's according to Vevo, which is the main provider of official music videos to YouTube. Karol G's were the most streamed around the world for each of the past four years, 2021 to 2024. This year, Karol G's Vevo videos were watched 3.5 billion times, with fellow Colombian Shakira in second place on 1.96 billion, and Swift on 1.95 billion. So who is Karol G, and what has fuelled the success that also saw her sell out Madrid's Bernabéu Stadium over four nights back in July, plus stadiums across the US last year? Born in the Colombian city of Medellín in 1991 her full name is Carolina Giraldo Navarro. She wanted to be a singer from an early age, and when she was 14 she appeared on the Colombian version of the talent show X Factor in 2005. Success did not immediately follow, and instead by 2014 she had moved to the US to live with her aunt in New York City to learn English and do menial work. She almost gave up pursuing a career in music at this time, but her father convinced her that she could make it. While in the US Karol G also attended a music business conference in Boston, which she says was very helpful in helping her understand how the industry worked. She got her breakthrough hit single in 2017, the song Ahora Me Llama, which was a collaboration with Puerto Rican male artist Bad Bunny. Her first album Unstoppable then followed. Since then the hits have just kept on coming, and her 2023 album, Mañana Será Bonito, was the first entirely Spanish-language release by a female artist to top the US album chart. Karol G's style of music is more often described as ""reggaeton"". This combines hip-hop with Latin American and Jamaican music, with the singing and rapping usually done in Spanish. While she is widely reported to be both hardworking and ambitious, Rocío Guerrero, head of Latin music at Amazon Music, says that the singer – and Latin music in general - have been greatly helped by the rise of streaming, both the music and the accompanying videos. ""Streaming democratised the landscape,"" says Ms Guerrero, explaining that it has allowed Latin music, which wasn't being played on mainstream radio stations to travel the world. ""Radio stations were local, but with streaming we brought together all of those audiences [around the globe]. It has given more opportunity to more Latin songs and artist to be exposed. Karol G is a perfect example of this evolution."" Today on Amazon Music more than a third of Latin music is now consumed outside Latin America, and in the last three years alone the listenership for Karol G has grown by more than 250%. Meanwhile, in the US, Latin music is now the fastest-growing genre, hitting a record $1.4bn (£1.1bn) in venues last year, according to the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Streaming accounted for 98% of this. And this year, Karol's G's Mañana Será Bonito album was the fourth most streamed globally on Spotify. This helped to boost interest in her 2023-24 sell-out, global Mañana Será Bonito Tour. This grossed $307m in ticket sales. And while that figure is dwarfed by the $2bn achieved by Taylor Swift's Eras tour, Karol G's earnings were the highest for a female Latin artist. Carlos Balado, a professor at OBS Business School in Barcelona, analyses the economic impact of music concerts. He says that both Karol G and Taylor Swift have benefited from the increased popularity of going to such a big live event. ""There's a growing trend where the public considers that part of their normal spending has to go towards concerts,"" he adds. Leila Cobo, chief content officer for Latin/Español at US music magazine Billboard, which is also known for its music charts, says Karol G has helped to put Colombian music on the map. ""I think music is the biggest ambassador for Colombia. I really do,"" she says. ""And Karol G has tapped into this female Latin female fanbase who really didn't have someone like her. They wanted someone relatable, fun, sexy, had cool songs, but wasn't completely over the top. ""And reggaeton is super danceable, it's super consumable, it's super youth oriented,"" adds Ms Cobo, who is the author of a book on Latin music. Despite winning numerous awards and critical acclaim, Karol G has not been immune to criticism. Her lyrics have been slammed for being too raunchy, and critics have also taken aim at her for calling one of her songs ""Bichota"". This is a slang term meaning big shot or boss, and often associated with drugs and criminality. She argues that she repurposed the word to signify empowerment. As for her lyrics, her defenders say that rather than singing about and objectifying women, she sings on behalf of them. Karol G's estimated net worth had skyrocketed to $25m by 2023 according to Celebrity Net Worth - a figure that's likely increased substantially since her recent tour. Outside of music she earns money by collaborations with shoemaker Crocs, sportswear brand Kappa, Smirnoff vodka, and Spanish fashion label Loewe. Her name has also appeared on the front of FC Barcelona shirts as part of the football club's partnership with music streamer Spotify. Ms Cobo says: ""She's branching out. She's a very bright, inquisitive person and always looking to grow. And she's very aware that it's not just about music."" Karol G's business ventures are controlled by her company Girl Power Inc, which also oversees her charity Con Cora Foundation. This aims to help improve the lives of underprivileged women and children across Latin America by giving educational scholarships to teenage mothers, supporting girls who want to go into science, technology, engineering, and mathematics, providing financial aid to kids' football teams, and society-reintegration projects for female inmates. Meanwhile, Karol G launched her own record label in 2023, Bichota, to have more control over her music, which is subsequently distributed and promoted by US company Interscope, part of the giant Universal Music Group. Yet despite her global success, there are still markets she hasn't yet cracked - the UK, for example, where she's still not widely known. Britain has a small, but fast-growing Hispanic diaspora. However, Amazon's Ms Guerrero thinks it is only a matter of time before Karol G does break the British market. ""It's going to happen. It's just a matter of time,"" she says."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czendjlx849o,Record outbreak of dengue fever in Central and South America,2024-12-11T06:25:55.951Z,Sofia Ferreira Santos,"The number of cases of dengue fever in Central and South America has nearly tripled to a record high this year, the Pan American Health Organisation (Paho) said on Tuesday. More than 12.6m cases and 7,700 deaths were recorded in what Paho says is the biggest outbreak in the region since records began in 1980. Brazil, Argentina, Colombia in South America and Mexico in North America were hit especially hard by the virus, accounting for the majority of cases and deaths. Dengue is a mosquito-borne virus that can cause serious illness or death in some cases. Symptoms include a fever, severe headache, pain behind the eyes, muscle and joint pain, and a blotchy rash. Those with a more severe type of dengue might experience severe stomach pain, fatigue, vomiting, and blood in vomit or stool. Vaccines have been introduced in some countries in the region, while others, such as Honduras, plan to start distribution in 2025. In a statement, Paho urged for stronger mitigation efforts and collaboration across the Americas. Its director, Dr Jarbas Barbosa, said the high number of cases was linked to a hotter, wetter climate and factors such as accumulated water around the home and poor waste management, which create breeding grounds for mosquitoes. He also said the virus was posing a ""higher-than-normal"" risk to children. In Guatemala, 70% of dengue-related deaths were children, while in Mexico, Costa Rica and Paraguay, under-15s made up more than a third of severe cases, Paho data showed. Children and people with pre-existing health conditions are more likely to catch the disease and develop more serious symptoms. Around half the world's population live in areas with a risk of contracting the disease, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It is spread through the bite of an infected mosquito, most commonly the Aedes aegypti."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2w9ppej0xo,Brazil's president 'well' after brain bleed surgery,2024-12-10T11:14:01.931Z,Vanessa Buschschlüter,"Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva is doing ""well"" after undergoing surgery for a brain bleed, his doctors say. The 79-year-old was taken to hospital in the capital, Brasília, on Monday after he had complained of a severe headache. An MRI scan revealed the bleed and Lula was transferred to the renowned Sírio-Libanês hospital in São Paulo to have it drained. The intracranial haemorrhage was caused by a blow to the head he sustained when he fell in his bathroom at the presidential residence in October, according to a hospital statement. Doctors said they had performed a craniotomy on the president, a procedure in which part of the bone is surgically removed from the skull to treat the bleed and relieve the pressure. The bone is then replaced. In a news conference on Tuesday morning local time, the doctors said that the president was in a stable condition following the surgery and was conscious. They said Lula was ""lucid"" and conversing with medical staff. They also insisted that he had not sustained any brain injury and was not experiencing and after-effects from the surgery. Asked when he would return to the capital, doctors said that if everything went well, they expected Lula to be back in Brasilia ""next week"". Earlier, the presidential spokesman, Paulo Pimenta, had said that Lula would likely remain in the intensive care unit for another 48 hours. ""He is stable, conscious and calm,"" Mr Pimenta said. While Lula is in hospital, Vice-President Geraldo Alckmin will take on some of the president's commitments, including welcoming Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico, who is due to arrive in Brazil later today. The doctors said the bleeding was a result of the fall Lula had sustained in October. They explained that it was not unusual for problems from a blow to the head to appear ""months later"". Lula had slipped in the bathroom in the Alvorada Palace on 19 October and hit the back of his head. He had to have five stitches and, on his doctors' advice, cancelled his planned trip to Russia for a summit of the Brics countries. He returned to full duties days later. Lula has been in power since 1 January 2023 after narrowly beating the incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, in a bitterly fought election. During the election campaign, he often joked that he had ""the energy of a 30-year-old""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp3zw2dpqgpo,Haiti gang kills 110 people accused of witchcraft,2024-12-09T13:38:16.970Z,Vanessa Buschschlüter,"At least 110 mostly elderly people have been brutally murdered by gang members in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, according to a human rights group. The National Human Rights Defence Network (RNDDH) said a local gang leader had targeted them after his son fell ill and subsequently died. The gang leader reportedly consulted a voodoo priest who blamed elderly locals practising ""witchcraft"" for the boy's mystery illness. The United Nations said the number of people killed in Haiti so far this year in spiralling gang violence had reached ""a staggering 5,000"". Warning: This story contains details some readers may find upsetting While details from the massacre are still emerging, the UN's human rights chief Volker Türk on Monday put the number of people killed over the weekend ""in violence orchestrated by the leader of a powerful gang"" at 184. The killings happened in the Cité Soleil neighbourhood of the capital. According to reports, gang members seized scores of residents aged over 60 from their homes in the Wharf Jérémie area, rounded them up and then shot or stabbed them to death with knives and machetes. Residents reported seeing mutilated bodies being burned in the streets. RNDDH estimated 60 were killed on Friday while another 50 were rounded up and murdered on Saturday, after the gang leader's son had died of his illness. While RNDDH said that all the victims were over 60, another rights group said some younger people who had tried to protect the elderly had also been killed. Local media said that elderly people believed to be practitioners of voodoo had been singled out because the gang leader had been told his son's illness had been caused by them. Rights groups said the man who had ordered the killings was Monel Felix, also known as Mikano. Mikano is known to control Wharf Jérémie, a strategic area in the port of the capital. According to Romain Le Cour Grandmaison, a Haiti expert at the Global Initiative against Transnational Crime (GI-TOC), the area is small but hard for the security forces to penetrate. Local media said that residents had been prevented from leaving Wharf Jérémie by Mikano's gang, so news of the deadly killings was slow to spread. The group forms part of the Viv Ansanm gang alliance, which controls much of the Haitian capital. Haiti has been engulfed in a wave of gang violence since the assassination in 2021 of the then-president, Jovenel Moïse. Data gathered by GI-TOC shows there was a decline in the murder rate between May and September of this year, after rival gangs had reached an uneasy truce. But attempts by the gangs to expand their territory beyond their strongholds in the capital have led to particularly bloody incidents in the past two months, with ordinary residents rather than rival gang members being increasingly targeted. On 3 October, 115 locals were killed in the small town of Pont-Sondé in the Artibonite department. That massacre was reportedly carried out by the Gran Grif gang in retaliation for some residents joining a vigilante group to resist attempts by Gran Grif to extort locals. If confirmed, the death toll given by the UN for this weekend's killings in Cité Soleil, would make it the deadliest incident so far this year. With gangs in control of an estimated 85% of Port-au-Prince and increasingly large swathes of the countryside, hundreds of thousands of Haitians have been forced to flee their homes. According to the International Organization for Migration, more than 700,000 people - half of them children - are internally displaced across the country. Gang members often use sexual abuse, including gang rape, to sow terror among the local population. In a report published two weeks ago, Human Rights Watch researcher Nathalye Cotrino wrote that ""the rule of law in Haiti is so broken that members of criminal groups rape girls or women without fearing any consequences"". Attempts by the Kenyan-led Multinational Security Support Mission to quell the violence have so far failed. The international police force arrived in Haiti in June to bolster the Haitian National Police but is underfunded and lacks the necessary equipment to take on the heavily armed gangs. Meanwhile, the Transitional Presidential Council (TPC) - the body created to organise elections and re-establish democratic order - appears to be in turmoil. The TPC replaced the interim prime minister last month and seems to have made little progress towards organising elections. ""They reign over a mountain of ashes,"" GI-TOC's Romain Le Cour Grandmaison writes of the council in his report."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn9gg220xzjo,Dominican Republic records largest cocaine seizure,2024-12-07T09:29:08.173Z,Jake Lapham,"Authorities in the Dominican Republican say cocaine discovered in the country's largest-ever seizure was headed to Europe. Hidden in a banana shipment, officials found 9,500kg of the drug at a port in the capital, Santo Domingo. The cocaine was hidden in 320 bags with an estimated street value of $250 million (£196 million). At least 10 people linked to the port are under investigation with early investigations showing the bananas had arrived from Guatemala, according to the National Drug Control Directorate. Communications chief Carlos Denvers said: ""Many unknown individuals tried to transfer the drugs to another container that would be shipped on a vessel to Belgium."" The haul far exceeds the 2,580kg seizure made by Dominican authorities at the same port in 2006. Monitoring agencies have reported that the Caribbean is resurfacing as a major drug trafficking route from Colombia to Europe. A report last year found the use of cocaine is increasing in several western European countries including the UK, Belgium, France and Spain. Europe accounted for 21% of the world's cocaine users in 2020, according to a United Nations report. Evidence suggests use of the drug is bringing dire health consequences, with recent data showing drug-poisoning deaths in England and Wales hit the highest level in 30 years, fuelled by a 30% rise in fatalities involving cocaine."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdr0dg4g11do,Disappearances double in Sinaloa amid Mexican cartel rift,2024-12-05T14:38:06.519Z,Vanessa Buschschlüter,"The number of people who have been reported missing in the violence-wracked Mexican state of Sinaloa has doubled since two rival factions of a drugs cartel started a bloody battle for control of their criminal organisation. According to official figures, more than 200 people have disappeared since the two factions of the Sinaloa cartel declared war on each other almost three months ago. The feud broke out after the arrest in the US of Ismael ""El Mayo"" Zambada. His followers, known as ""Los Mayos"" or ""La Mayiza"", say he was betrayed by the son of the infamous founder of the Sinaloa cartel, Joaquín ""El Chapo"" Guzmán, and have turned on members of his faction, known as ""Los Chapitos"". Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has despatched her security chief, Omar García Harfuch, to Sinaloa state to quell the violence. The spike in murders and disappearances in Sinaloa has overshadowed Sheinbaum's first months in office. She was sworn in as Mexico's first female head of state on 1 October after a campaign in which she had promised to maintain the approach taken by her predecessor in office, who avoided direct confrontations with the cartels. ""There will be no return to the irresponsible drug war,"" she had said in her inaugural speech, ruling out a more militaristic approach. But faced with growing criticism in her own country and pressure from US President-elect Donald Trump, who wants Mexico to do more to curb the trafficking to the US of the synthetic opioid fentanyl, Sheinbaum on Wednesday appeared to make tackling the violence in Sinaloa her priority. In a news conference, she said her Administration would take a ""zero tolerance"" approach. She also praised the security forces for making Mexico's biggest fentanyl bust to date. ""This is an investigation that has been going on for a long time and yesterday, it gave these results. It is the largest seizure of fentanyl pills ever made,"" she said. Earlier, Mexico's top security official, Omar García Harfuch, had announced on X, formerly known as Twitter, that the fentanyl pills seized at two properties in Sinaloa were worth $394m (£309m) and weighed more than a tonne. ""These actions will continue until the violence diminishes in the state of Sinaloa,"" he said in the post [in Spanish]. News of the massive fentanyl bust came just over a week after Trump threatened to impose 25% tariffs on goods coming from Mexico and Canada on day one of his presidency. He said the tariffs would remain in place until ""until such time as drugs, in particular fentanyl, and all illegal aliens stop this invasion of our country"". Mexican officials also announced on Wednesday that they had detained more than 5,200 migrants across the country the previous day, in what appeared to be a response to President Sheinbaum's promise to Trump to stop a migrant caravan moving north through Mexico from reaching the US border."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86wl5ex6gzo,Selling sex for gold in the Amazon's illegal mines,2024-12-05T01:28:46.277Z,Thais Carrança and Emma Ailes,"Dayane Leite never wanted to become a sex worker but at the age of 17 her husband died of a heart attack and she couldn’t pay for the funeral. Her home town, Itaituba in Brazil’s northern Para state, is at the heart of the country’s illegal gold-mining trade, so a friend suggested raising the money by having sex with miners, deep in the Amazon. “Going to the mines is a roll of the dice,” she says. “The women are seriously humiliated there. They may be slapped in the face and yelled at. “I was sleeping in my bedroom and a guy jumped through the window and put a gun to my head. And if they pay, they want to own the women.” Dayane successfully gathered the money for the funeral, and at the age of 18 she had her first child. For the last 16 years, like many women in Itaituba, she has been returning periodically to the mines to work as a cook, a washerwoman, a barmaid and a sex worker. She now has a family of seven to support. “I'm not going to say that all the women in the city do it, but a fair share of them do sex work. So it’s kind of normal. We don’t really care,” says Natalia Cavalcante, who became a sex worker in a remote mining settlement at 24. Four years later, after marrying the owner of a bar, she became the madam of a brothel – a job she only gave up recently, to look after her nieces in the city. Life in mining villages in the rainforest is harsh - most consist of just a dirt track, saloon bars and a church. But the miners themselves live even further out, in shacks made of wood and canvas, surrounded by snakes and jaguars, and in total darkness once the generator is switched off. Women working as cooks have to live in these camps, alongside the men. The miners appear in the village whenever they have found gold and have money to spend, Natalia adds. Sometimes they have to be persuaded to have a shower before sex, women say. Running a brothel is illegal under Brazilian law, but Natalia says she took no commission, she just employed bar staff and rented out rooms. Young women would contact her asking for work, and she sometimes lent them money for the journey, a seven-hour drive from Itaituba. Asked whether she had misgivings about involving other women in the work, she replied: “Sometimes I think: ‘I’ve been through that, and I know it’s not that nice.’ But then I think: ‘The girl has a family, sometimes a child to raise. Many of the girls who go have one or two children.’ So we accept it.” Even before marrying, Natalia had made a lot of money. She now has her own house in Itaituba, a motorbike, and considerable quantities of gold that she sometimes received as payment for sex, two or three grams at a time. Her goal is to study, to become a lawyer or an architect. Some women in Itaituba, nicknamed Gold Nugget City, have set themselves up in business with the money they made, she says. But it’s a big risk to venture as a woman into the violent and lawless mining settlements. While the environmental harm of the mines is well known, the human cost - which the UN says includes violence, sexual exploitation and trafficking - goes largely unreported. A dealer in precious metals told the BBC that the illegal gold from these mines would typically be relabelled as gold from a licensed mining co-operative, before being exported and turned into jewellery and components for mobile phones, or other electronic goods. The three largest customers of Brazilian gold are Canada, Switzerland and the UK. More than 90% of all exports to Europe are from areas where illegal mining occurs, according to the Instituto Escolhas think tank. It’s not unknown for women to be murdered in mining villages. The dead body of 26-year-old Raiele Santos was found last year in the room where she had been living near the Cuiú-Cuiú gold mine, 11 hours’ drive from Itaituba. Her elder sister, Railane, says a man had offered her money for sex and she had refused, so he found her later and beat her to death. “A lot of women die on a daily basis, a lot of women,” Railane says. “I was born in the mines, I grew up in the mines, and now I'm afraid to live in the mines.” A man has been arrested in connection with Raiele’s murder, but has not yet been tried. He denies all the charges against him. The land covered by Brazil’s illegal gold mines more than doubled in the 10 years to 2023, to 220,000 hectares – an area larger than Greater London. No-one knows how many women work in this area, or even how many illegal miners there are. The Brazilian government says the latter figure could be anywhere from 80,000 to 800,000. Under President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, the government has taken steps to close illegal mines and to stop dealers buying the gold they produce, but high gold prices continue to drive many men to try their luck. Dayane wants to stop working in the mining areas because of the risks and the toll the hardship takes on her body, but she is planning what she hopes will be one last trip. Her goal is to earn enough in two or three months to open a snack bar on her return, though she realises she may not succeed. Whenever she is alone, walking in the forest, she will worry about her children, she says. “I will keep trying, until I can’t any more,” she says. “Because I think that one day, my children will say: ‘My mum worked so hard. She went through what she went through for us, and she never gave up.’” Additional reporting by Mariana Schreiber, BBC Brasil You can watch the BBC 100 Women documentary, Sex for Gold, on the BBC iPlayer from Saturday 7 December BBC 100 Women names 100 inspiring and influential women around the world every year.

The voting tallies - a detailed official breakdown of the votes from each polling station - have been at the centre of the dispute over who won the election. The government-aligned National Electoral Council (CNE) declared the incumbent, President Nicolás Maduro, the winner but failed to provide the voting tallies to back up its claim. The opposition, which with the help of accredited election witnesses collected and published more than 80% of the voting tallies, says these prove that its candidate, Edmundo González, was the overwhelming winner. The Human Rights Committee - a UN body made up of 18 independent experts - said it was investigating allegations of electoral fraud following a complaint brought by a law firm on behalf of a Venezuelan voter. As part of that investigation, the committee demanded that the Venezuelan state preserve the detailed voting data from the presidential election on 28 July. There has been huge pressure on the CNE - which is stacked with government loyalists - to release the voting tallies. But more than four months on from the election, it still has not done so, blaming an alleged computer hack on election night for its unprecedented failure to provide the data within 30 days of the election date. In contrast, the opposition quickly uploaded the voting tallies it had gathered onto a website. Independent observers and media, including the New York Times and CNN, say those tallies suggest that Edmundo González won the election with 67% of the votes compared to Maduro's 30%. But Nicolás Maduro has dismissed the tallies published by the opposition as ""fraudulent"" and maintains that he is the election winner. He is ploughing ahead with preparations for 10 January, when he says he will be sworn in to his third consecutive term in office. This has pitted him against a growing number of countries, including the United States, Italy, Argentina, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Panama, Peru and Uruguay, which have recognised González as the president-elect of Venezuela. IHR Legal, the international law firm which brought the complaint before the UN Human Rights Committee, said the case was ""pioneering"" and ""historic"" and could lead to the committee ""confirming that Nicolás Maduro is not the president-elect of Venezuela""."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c89v4w51dzyo,Mexico leader responds to Trump claim she agreed to stop migration,2024-11-28T19:46:17.147Z,Will Grant and Vanessa Buschschlüter,"Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum has sought to clarify details of a conversation she had with US President-elect Donald Trump, after the two leaders offered differing accounts of the call. Following Wednesday's call, Trump said Sheinbaum had ""agreed to stop Migration through Mexico, and into the United States, effectively closing our Southern Border"". This prompted Sheinbaum to say she had merely reiterated Mexico's position, which she said was ""not to close borders but to build bridges between governments and people"". The call followed Trump's announcement on Monday that, upon taking office in January, he would slap an across-the-board tariff of 25% on Mexico and Canada, and a 10% tariff on China. He said the import duties on Mexico and Canada would only be removed once illegal immigration and drug trafficking to the US had stopped. The announcement was initially met with combative language from President Sheinbaum, who vowed earlier on Wednesday to retaliate if the US triggered a trade war. ""If there are US tariffs, Mexico would also raise tariffs,"" she said of the proposed duties, which appear to breach the USMCA trade deal that Trump himself struck in 2018 during his first presidency between the US, Mexico and Canada. Speaking to reporters on Thursday, the Mexican president said she did not specifically discuss tariffs in the phone call with Trump but that they had addressed immigration and fentanyl trafficking - the reasons Trump had named for imposing the tariffs in the first place. She said she had reassured him that a migrant caravan he had expressed concern about was ""not going to reach the [northern] Mexican frontier"" with the US but she stressed that ""it has never been our plan to close the border with the US"". Sheinbaum insisted that the conversation had been ""very amiable"" and that they had agreed they would ""continue with our talks"". In what appeared an altogether more conciliatory tone compared to her initial reaction to Trump's import tax announcement, she also insisted there was now ""no possibility of a tariff war"" between Mexico and the US. The flow of migrants from Mexico in the US has long overshadowed relations between the two neighbours and became a defining issue in the 2024 White House election race that culminated in Trump’s resounding victory this month. Under US diplomatic pressure, Mexico has been conducting its largest ever migrant crackdown, bussing and flying non-Mexican migrants to the country’s south, far from the US border. But Trump campaigned on a promise to seal the US-Mexico border and his threat to impose 25% tariffs was seen as an attempt to force Mexico into doing more to stop the migrants from reaching the US southern border. The Mexican government has in turn demanded that the US take action to stop the flow of weapons being smuggled from the US into Mexico. Sheinbaum told reporters on Thursday that she would raise the issue of guns with Trump ""in due time"". Earlier this week Trump spoke with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. On Wednesday night, Trudeau held an emergency meeting with the leaders of the country's provinces and territories to discuss the tariff threat. According to a summary of the call, they were urged to ""make use of all of their contacts, channels, and abilities to relay important information and messages to Americans and people of influence"" about the deep economic and security ties between the US and Canada."
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-20041847,Uruguay country profile,2024-11-25T12:20:03.000Z,,"Uruguay has traditionally been more affluent than other countries in South America, and is known for its advanced education and social security systems and liberal social laws. It was the first nation in Latin America to establish a welfare state, maintained through relatively high taxes on industry, and developed a democratic tradition that earned it the sobriquet ""the Switzerland of South America"". But economic and political turmoil, in particular left-wing urban guerrilla attacks in the early 1970s, led the government of the day to suspend the constitution and launch a period of repressive military rule that lasted until 1985. Since the restoration of democratic government, successive governments have liberalised the economy. Colonial towns, beach resorts and a year-round mild climate have contributed to a growing tourist industry. Read more country profiles

Orsi struck a business-friendly note in his campaign, saying that he planned to avoid raising taxes that could scare off investors. After his victory, he stressed he wanted to be a president for all Uruguayans, saying he would ""call for a national dialogue again and again"" and that he would listen to those who had voted for his rival. ""I'm going to be the president who builds a more integrated country, where we set aside our differences and nobody is left behind, neither economically, socially or politically."" Uruguay's election - which pitted two moderates against each other - bucked the trend seen in other countries in the Western Hemisphere, such as Argentina, Brazil and the US, where deep divisions came to the fore. Uruguayans can access a wide range of views via hundreds of privately-owned media outlets. The state of media freedom is healthy and Uruguay has been praised for setting up an independent broadcasting regulator.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9qlryz9xg1o,Former history teacher Yamandú Orsi wins Uruguay election,2024-11-25T11:17:27.146Z,Vanessa Buschschlüter,"A left-wing former history teacher, Yamandú Orsi, has won the presidential election in Uruguay. Orsi beat Álvaro Delgado, the candidate for the governing conservative coalition, by more than three percentage points in Sunday's run-off. Delgado conceded defeat and congratulated Orsi and his Broad Front coalition, which will now return to power after five years of conservative rule. The Broad Front governed Uruguay for 15 years from 2005 to 2020 before being beaten by outgoing President Luis Lacalle Pou - who under Uruguay's constitution was barred from standing for a second consecutive term in this election. Orsi, 57, is seen as a protege of former President José Mujica, who won the hearts of many in Uruguay through his modest lifestyle, prompting many to label him ""the world's poorest president"". Orsi himself comes from a humble background, having grown up in rural Uruguay in a house without electricity. While working as a school history teacher, he became active in local politics, eventually becoming mayor of Canelones, Uruguay's second-most populous department. During Orsi's time at the helm in Canelones, tech giant Google announced it would build a huge data centre in the department. Orsi struck a business-friendly note in his campaign, saying that he planned to avoid raising taxes that could scare off investors. Addressing his supporters on Sunday evening, he stressed he wanted to be a president for all 3.4 million Uruguayans, saying he would ""call for a national dialogue again and again"" and that he would listen to those who had voted for his rival. ""I'm going to be the president who builds a more integrated country, where we set aside our differences and nobody is left behind, neither economically, socially or politically."" Outgoing President Luis Lacalle Pou said he would work with Orsi to ensure a smooth transition ahead of the swearing-in of the new president on 1 March next year. Orsi's Broad Front also won a majority in the Uruguyan Senate, but his coalition did not clinch a majority in the Chamber of Representatives. Uruguay's election - which pitted two moderates against each other - has bucked the trend seen in other countries in the Western Hemisphere, such as Argentina, Brazil and the US, where deep divisions came to the fore."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c98e29yvl88o,Brazil police formally accuse Bolsonaro of alleged coup plot,2024-11-21T22:07:07.498Z,Amy Walker,"Ex-Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro and some of his closest allies have been formally accused of allegedly plotting a coup, after he lost the 2022 presidential election. Bolsonaro's vice-presidential candidate Walter Braga Netto and 35 other people have also been indicted by federal police for attempted violent abolition of the democratic rule of law, coup d'état and criminal organisation. It comes after a nearly two-year-long investigation into whether Bolsonaro incited a failed coup after claiming the election was fraudulent. In a post on X, Bolsonaro said he would mount a legal ""fight"" against the claims, and accused investigators of being ""creative"" and doing ""everything that the law does not say"". In a statement, police said their probe ""found the existence of a criminal organisation that acted in a coordinated manner, in 2022, in an attempt to keep the then president of the republic in power"". Police have forwarded the report with the indictment of the 37 people to the court. The country's top prosecutor will now decide whether to press charges. Among those accused of being part of a criminal conspiracy to stage a coup are Bolsonaro's former spy chief Alexandre Ramagem, as well as former ministers Anderson Torres and Augusto Heleno. The indictment is a fresh blow for Bolsonaro's hard-right backers, who had hoped to overturn a ban blocking him from office in time to him to run for president in 2026. Earlier this week, federal police in Brazil arrested five people who are suspected of plotting to kill then president-elect Lula in the days before he took office. In the last few months, federal police have also formally accused Bolsonaro of tampering with his Covid-19 vaccination cards while in office and of benefiting from an illegal scheme to sell jewellery gifted to his government by Saudi Arabia. Bolsonaro was banned from running for office for eight years after being accused of undermining Brazilian democracy by falsely claiming that electronic ballots used in the October 2022 poll were vulnerable to hacking and fraud. The bitterly fought election was won by an extremely narrow margin by left-winger Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva. Mr Bolsonaro never publicly acknowledged his defeat and left Brazil for the US two days before Lula was sworn in as president. His supporters, who refused to accept the outcome of the election, stormed Brazil's Congress, the presidential palace and the building housing the Supreme Court on 8 January 2023. Parts of the buildings were ransacked and police arrested 1,500 of the rioters. In his X post, Bolsonaro added that he would wait to see what was in the indictment. ""I will wait for the lawyer. This, obviously, will go to the attorney general's office. It is at the PGR [Prosecutor General of the Republic] that the fight begins,"" he added."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c75l9rl124po,MSF halts work in Haitian capital over attacks,2024-11-20T04:15:27.016Z,Will Grant,"The humanitarian medical organisation Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) has suspended its operations in the Haitian capital, Port-au-Prince, following a violent attack on its staff and the alleged killing of two patients they were treating by Haitian police officers. The incident took place last week as violence continued to worsen in the country. An estimated 25 people were killed in Port-au-Prince on Tuesday alone in what police say was a foiled attempt at a gang invasion of a wealthy neighbourhood. Politically, the situation also remains critical with interim Prime Minister Garry Conille fired this month by the country's ruling council - less than six months after he took office. MSF says that on 11 November one of its ambulances carrying three young men with gunshot wounds was stopped by Haitian law enforcement officers. Apparently supported by a paramilitary self-defence group, the men attacked the vehicle, removed two of the patients, took them outside hospital grounds and executed them. The humanitarian group denounced the violence in a strongly worded statement last week, saying their personnel had been tear-gassed and held against their will for several hours. While that incident appears to have been the final straw for MSF in Port-au-Prince, at least for the time being, it was not the only recent example of extreme aggression against their staff. The announcement comes amid a worsening climate of violence in Haiti with some 25 suspected gang members killed in the capital on Tuesday. The police say that residents helped officers to fight off an attempted attack on the upscale suburb of Pétion-Ville. The neighbourhood was cordoned off after residents barricaded streets, some armed with machetes and makeshift weapons, in an apparent effort to prevent a gang invasion."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c79zj9279nlo,Brazil arrests soldiers over 'plot to kill' President Lula in 2022,2024-11-19T14:10:32.474Z,Vanessa Buschschlüter,"Police in Brazil have arrested five people suspected of planning to kill Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva shortly before he was sworn in as president. Four of those detained on Tuesday are soldiers and one is a police officer, local media reported. The five were allegedly part of a plot to kill President-elect Lula and his vice-presidential running mate, Geraldo Alckmin, on 15 December 2022, just over two weeks before the presidential inauguration. Lula was elected in October 2022, narrowly defeating incumbent Jair Bolsonaro, who never publicly accepted defeat. A week after Lula was sworn in, Bolsonaro supporters stormed Congress, the Supreme Court and the presidential palace and vandalised the buildings. Police eventually cleared the buildings of the rioters and detained thousands. Investigations into the events of 8 January 2023 as well as previous alleged attempts to prevent Lula from being sworn in have been under way since. However, this is the first time that police have revealed an alleged attempt to assassinate Lula. Speaking after news of the arrests broke, Social Communications Minister Paulo Pimenta said that the alleged plot to assassinate Lula and Alckmin had almost gone ahead. ""It was just details which stopped it [from being carried out],"" the minister said. Brazilian news site G1 said that what was particularly worrying was that four of those arrested were active members of the military and the fifth a serving member of the police force. AFP news agency quoted a federal police source as saying that the four soldiers ""were arrested in Rio, where they were participating in the security operation for the G20 leaders' meeting"" currently under way in the Brazilian city. According to G1, the four soldiers, who had had special forces training, are accused of forming part of a criminal organisation plotting against Lula. Brazil's federal police said in a statement that its investigations ""indicate that the criminal organisation used a high level of technical-military knowledge to plan, coordinate and execute illicit actions in the months of November and December 2022"". According to the statement, the plotters had not just planned to assassinate the president-elect and the vice-president-elect but also wanted to arrest and execute a member of the Supreme Court once their coup was successful. Police said the plotters had nicknamed the operation ""green and yellow dagger"", in reference to the colours of the Brazilian flag. According to the federal police, the plotters had debated how to best ""neutralise"" Lula and Geraldo Alckmin and had allegedly settled on poisoning the president-elect. The arrests were carried out in the early hours of Tuesday morning local time and were authorised by Supreme Court Justice Alexandre de Moraes."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly0jzekw84o,Hundreds of Honduran villages cut off by torrential rain,2024-11-18T11:33:53.749Z,Vanessa Buschschlüter,"Torrential rain caused by Tropical Storm Sara has cut off more than 1,700 communities in Honduras. The slow-moving storm caused widespread flooding across the Central American nation. So far, Honduran officials have confirmed only one death but said that more than 110,000 people had been affected by the storm. Forecasters say Sara is likely to further weaken on Monday as it moves over the southern Mexican state of Quintana Roo. Sara formed in the Caribbean Sea on Thursday. The tropical storm was extremely slow moving, dumping huge amounts of rain on northern Honduras for four days running before moving north to Belize and Mexico. Some areas saw 500mm (19.7 inches) of rain fall causing rivers to swell. Nine bridges were destroyed by fast flowing waters and another 19 damaged, Honduran emergency services said. Several highways also became impassable following landslides. Honduran President Xiomara Castro had warned citizens living near rivers as early as Thursday to take shelter elsewhere and thousands heeded her call. More than 2,500 homes were damaged and more than 200 destroyed, officials said. Sara is the 18th named storm of the Atlantic hurricane season and the third this month. Less than two weeks ago, Hurricane Rafael caused a nationwide blackout when it hit Cuba. Meteorologists say the storms have been fuelled by high sea surface temperatures. While hurricanes and tropical storms occur naturally, human-caused climate change is supercharging them and exacerbating the risk of major damage,” Kevin Trenberth, a distinguished scholar at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colorado, has warned."

While advocating for tougher social media regulation on a panel about disinformation, Janja Lula da Silva appeared to be startled by a loud noise, joking, ""I think it's Elon Musk."" ""I'm not afraid of you,"" she went on to say, then swore at the billionaire, who owns Tesla and social media platform X. Musk, who was picked to lead the Department of Government Efficiency in incoming US President Donald Trump's administration, has a complicated relationship with Brazil and its left-wing government. X was briefly banned there this year. He reposted a video of the incident, captioned ""lol"". In another post, Musk added two laughing emojis and wrote: ""They are going to lose the next election"", apparently referring to President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva's Workers Party. Earlier this year, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered a nationwide ban on X, after it failed to name a legal representative in the country and suspend accounts for allegedly spreading disinformation. The ban was lifted after the platform paid a $5.1m (£3.8m) fine more than a month later. But Musk is also an ally of Brazil's former far-right President Jair Bolsonaro, who was found guilty of discrediting the electoral system after losing in 2022. Despite the eight-year ban stopping him from running in an election, he has declared his intent to run again in the next elections, to be held in 2026. Bolsonaro, who reposted a screenshot of the video and Musk's response, said, ""We now have another diplomatic problem."" Leaders of the G20 nations will be meeting for the summit, which starts on Monday."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yx5qzzypgo,Venezuela frees more than 100 arrested after disputed election result,2024-11-17T02:22:49.220Z,Ido Vock,"Venezuelan authorities have released more than 100 people arrested following July's contested presidential election, according to a local rights group. ""Up to now, we have verified 107 political prisoners, due to the post-electoral situation, released in Venezuela,"" said Alfredo Romero of NGO Foro Penal. The group said more than 1,800 people were arrested for their role in mass protests after the July election. Electoral authorities loyal to President Nicolás Maduro announced him the victor, but the claim has been widely rejected by the international community. After Maduro claimed victory, anti-government protests erupted. Hundreds have been charged with crimes including terrorism, incitement to hatred and resistance to authority, according to Human Rights Watch. Foro Penal said prisoners had been released at four different prisons. Videos published on social media showed prisoners being released to cheers from onlookers. Maduro is set to begin his third six-year term in January. Official results for July's election published by the National Electoral Council (CNE) claimed Maduro, 61, won 52% of the vote to opposition candidate Edmundo González's 43%. The opposition, however, said it had evidence González had won by a comfortable margin, and uploaded detailed voting tallies to the internet which suggest González beat Maduro convincingly. The CNE said it could not publish the voting records because the data had been corrupted by hackers. González was granted political asylum in Spain in September."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3demgg542do,Argentina orders arrests of pro-Bolsonaro rioters,2024-11-16T02:26:01.693Z,Frances Mao,"Argentina's courts have ordered the arrest of 61 Brazilians facing jail sentences for their involvement in the Brasilia riots last year. In January 2023, supporters of Brazil's former far-right president Jair Bolsonaro stormed Congress in an attempted overthrow of the new left-wing government led by Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, commonly known as Lula. Hundreds of the rioters were arrested, charged and released on bail. Some were convicted and sentenced. But others fled to Argentina to escape their sentences - particularly after far-right politician Javier Milei was elected president in December 2023. Judge Daniel Rafecas said the warrants would apply to those who had ""convictions with definite prison sentences,"" Brazilian news outlet Globo reported. In June this year, Brazilian authorities issued an extradition request to Argentina seeking help in extraditing more than 140 prosecuted rioters. But many in Brazil questioned whether the Milei government would agree. The Argentine president is a friend of Bolsonaro's and has been a staunch critic of Lula. However, in October, Argentina cancelled political asylum for people who have been convicted of crimes in their home country. And on Friday, an Argentine Federal Court judge ruled that the arrest warrants should be issued, noting the request of Brazil's supreme court. Local media also reported that local police on Friday had arrested one fugitive in La Plata city, about 60km (37 miles) from the Argentine capital Buenos Aires. It is unclear if the whereabouts of the other rioters are known. The Brazilian government believes the January 2023 riots were part of a coup attempt orchestrated by Bolsonaro following his defeat in a tightly contested presidential election the previous October. He denies any involvement. But in the weeks following the election, he made repeated claims on social media questioning the results of the vote and the integrity of Brazil's electronic voting system. Less than a week after Lula was inaugurated in January 2023, thousands of Bolsonaro supporters stormed the Congress building, the Supreme Court and Presidential Palace in Brasília. The arrest warrants come just two days after another attack in Brasilia's Three Powers Plaza, where a former political candidate committed a suicide bomb attack outside the Supreme Court. Police have named the man as Francisco Wanderley Luiz, who stood unsuccessfully in council elections for Bolsonaro's Liberal Party."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0j8el1q1gjo,One dead after attack on Brazil's Supreme Court,2024-11-14T15:33:29.376Z,Matt Murphy and Vanessa Buschschlüter,"A man who tried to attack Brazil's Supreme Court in the capital Brasilia on Wednesday evening has died after apparently detonating the explosives he was carrying. Police have named the man as Francisco Wanderley Luiz, who stood unsuccessfully in council elections for ex-President Jair Bolsonaro's Liberal Party (PL). Bystanders said they heard two explosions at around 19:30 local time (22:30 GMT), the second of which is believed to have killed Luiz. Nobody else was hurt in the incident, officials said. The explosions caused particular alarm because of where they occurred, on Praça dos Três Poderes - the square in the capital where the Supreme Court, the presidential palace and Congress are located. The Praça dos Três Poderes was the scene of mass disorder in January 2023, when supporters of Jair Bolsonaro ransacked the buildings days after President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva had been sworn into office. Brazil's solicitor general, Jorge Messias, described Wednesday's incident as a deliberate attack. Police said the first blast came from a car which belonged to Luiz. Shortly afterwards, a security guard saw a man carrying a rucksack throw a cloth over a statue representing the Lady of Justice, which is located in front of the building housing the Supreme Court. The guard said that when he approached him, the man opened his shirt to reveal what looked like explosives strapped to the man's body. According to the security guard, the man lobbed something at the building, lay down on the floor and appeared to set off an explosive device he had placed underneath his neck. Military police officers who secured the scene said the man ""had apparently taken his own life with explosives"". Sniffer dogs and bomb disposal robots were used to secure the area and the Supreme Court building was quickly evacuated. Local media reported that President Lula had left the area shortly before the blasts occurred. Justice Minister Ricardo Lewandowski said police were investigating the possible motive behind the attack which came just days before Brazil is due to host the G20 summit in Rio de Janeiro and a scheduled visit to Brasilia by the Chinese president, Xi Jinping. Police have since revealed that Luiz was 59 years old and originally from Rio do Sul, in southern Santa Catarina state, where he had stood as a councillor for Liberal Party in 2020 but received just 98 votes. The attack was widely condemned, including by members of the Liberal Party. Jair Bolsonaro’s adviser, Fabio Wajngarten, wrote on X: “There are crazy people everywhere, across all political spectrums, supporters of all teams, of all beliefs and religions.” Bolsonaro himself called for an ""environment of unity,"" saying that Brazil needed to ""once again cultivate an environment suitable for different ideas to confront each other peacefully"". Brasilia's Deputy Governor Celina Leão said Luiz ""could have been a lone wolf, like others we’ve seen around the world” but that police would carry out a thorough investigation."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c937n1xq34ko,"Ambulance patients killed in Haiti attack, charity says",2024-11-13T16:54:36.357Z,Frances Mao,"Doctors' charity Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) says at least two of its patients have been killed in Haiti after police and vigilantes attacked their ambulance in the capital Port-au-Prince. The charity said its crews had been transporting three patients with gunshot wounds to a MSF hospital on Monday when they were stopped by authorities and forced to go to a public hospital instead. When they arrived, officers and ""members of a self-defence group"" attacked the vehicle, slashing its tyres and forcing occupants out through tear-gas. The wounded patients were then taken away from the hospital grounds where ""at least two of them were executed"", the charity said. The condition of the third patient is unclear from MSF's statement. But the group said its ambulance staff were also assaulted in the incident by ""law enforcement officers and members of a self-defence group"". MSF said staff were ""violently attacked, insulted, tear-gassed, threatened with death"" and held hostage for more than four hours before being released. The motive behind the attack is unclear. ""The act is a shocking display of violence and it seriously calls into question MSF's ability to continue delivering essential care to the Haitian people,"" said Christophe Garnier, the group's head of mission in the country. MSF, also known as Doctors Without Borders, is one of the last humanitarian non-government organisations (NGOs) still operating in Haiti, where violent chaos has gripped the capital. Since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in 2021, armed gangs have seized power in many areas, leading to a spike in street violence in the poorest country in the Americas. A UN Security Council briefing last month heard that criminal gangs had gained control of 85% of the capital. More than 3,600 people have been killed in Haiti since January and more than 500,000 have had to leave their homes, according to the UN. A UN-backed international policing operation, largely made up of Kenyan police, is in Haiti and is said to have secured some key sites in the capital including the national hospital, seaport and airport. However, several US airlines suspended flights to the country this week after three planes approaching or departing the airport this week were hit by gunfire. A new prime minister was sworn into office in Haiti earlier this week. Alix Didier Fils-Aimé said his priority was ""restoring security"" in the country."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cyvee8vr7l1o,"Israel's military failed to protect civilians, first report on 7 October attack says",2025-02-27T20:19:25.512Z,Paul Adams,"Israel's military has published its first official account of the mistakes that led to its failures during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack, which triggered the Gaza war. The report concludes that the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ""failed in its mission to protect Israeli civilians"". The 19-page report contains much that is already known about what led to catastrophic loss of about 1,200 lives when approximately 5,000 gunmen from Hamas and other Palestinian groups stormed into Israel, also taking 251 hostages in the process. There are no dramatic revelations, but it is still sobering to see the military's conclusions about how it misjudged Hamas's intentions and underestimated its capabilities laid out in black and white. The report says the military regarded Gaza as a secondary security threat, with priority given to Iran and Hezbollah. Its policy towards Gaza, it says, was ""paradoxical: Hamas was illegitimate, yet there was no effort to develop an alternative"". The military had chosen a ""conflict management"" approach to dealing with Gaza, it says. And had assumed that Hamas was ""neither interested [in] nor preparing for a large-scale war"" - a perception reinforced by Hamas's own deception tactics. Evidence from 2018 onwards suggesting that Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist group by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - was indeed developing an ambitious plan was interpreted as ""unrealistic or unfeasible"", reflecting ""Hamas's long-term aspirations rather than an actionable threat"". The report says that in the months leading up to the war, the Military Intelligence Directorate began to develop a new assessment, suggesting that Hamas's plan was not merely a vision but ""a concrete framework for operational planning"". However, this emerging assessment was not brought to the attention of senior officials in military intelligence. The report identifies a broad streak of complacency within the military about Hamas's intentions and how to deal with the threat it posed. ""There was no deep discussion of the question: What if we are wrong?"" the report says. Over time, ""a significant and continuous gap between the intelligence assessments of Hamas and reality"" had developed. The report also highlights what it says was ""a decline in deep familiarity with the enemy's different worldview, including its culture, religion, language and history"". It calls for deep reform of the intelligence directorate's culture, ""fostering intellectual openness, scepticism, listening, learning, debate, and constructive disagreement"". It says the desire to protect highly valuable intelligence sources contributed to the military's failure to raise the alert level immediately before 7 October. The Gaza Division, it says, ""was effectively defeated for several hours"" on 7 October, significantly impairing its ability to understand what was going on and respond effectively. It says the Air Force responded quickly, but that ""there was significant difficulty distinguishing between IDF troops, civilians and terrorists"". The report also says that in some incidents, wounded soldiers were evacuated before civilians. After presenting the findings to commanders on Monday, the IDF's outgoing chief of staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, said he took full responsibility for the failures. ""I embrace my responsibility. It is mine. I was the commander of the army on 7 October and I have my responsibility and I have all of your responsibility. I see that as mine too. And I see that in every command of mine that went wrong, there is also a part of me,"" he said in a video. Last month, the general announced his resignation over the failures and called for a commission of inquiry to carry out a broader investigation that would help prevent another attack. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who has not acknowledged any responsibility for what happened on 7 October, has said such a state inquiry should wait until the end of the war. His critics accuse Mr Netanyahu of being unwilling to admit any personal fault. Israel responded to the 7 October attack by launching an air and ground campaign in Gaza, during which at least 48,365 people have been killed, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67477240,Who are Israeli hostages released and rescued from Gaza?,2025-02-27T15:10:54.000Z,,"A total of 25 hostages held by Hamas in Gaza have been released alive as part of a long-awaited ceasefire deal with Israel, which began on 19 January 2025. The bodies of another eight hostages have also been handed over by Hamas under the deal, which has seen around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails freed in exchange. Five living Thai nationals have also been released outside the framework. On 22 February, Eliya Cohen, Omer Shem Tov and Omer Wenkert were released in Nuseirat, central Gaza, while Avera Mengistu and Tal Shoham were freed in Rafah, southern Gaza. The sixth and final hostage Hisham al-Sayed was handed over to the Red Cross in a private exchange in Gaza City. The final exchange of the ceasefire deal's six-week-long first phase took place on 26 February, when the bodies of four Israeli hostages were returned. Negotiations on the second phase are yet to begin. Last updated on 27 February 2025 Eliya Cohen, 27, and his girlfriend Ziv Abud fled the attack on the Supernova music festival on 7 October 2023 and hid in a bomb shelter with relatives and friends. However, Hamas gunmen found the shelter and opened fire. Eliya was discovered and driven away, but Ziv escaped. Omer Shem Tov, 22, initially made a getaway from the festival in his car but was captured when he tried to rescue his friends, Maya and Itai Regev. All three were taken captive - the Regev siblings were released during a week-long ceasefire in November 2023. His mother said he was kept alone in an underground tunnel for the vast majority of his time in captivity. Tal Shoham, 40, was taken from Kibbutz Be'eri. His wife, Adi, their two young children, and his mother-in-law, Dr Shosham Haran, were also captured but released in November 2023. Dr Haran's husband, Avshalom, was killed during the 7 October attack. Omer Wenkert, 23, sent a message to his family to say he was going to a safe shelter after the Supernova music festival was attacked, but he then lost contact with them. His family said they saw Hamas video footage of Omer, including a photo of him handcuffed and wearing only underwear. In an Instagram post published following his release, Omer said the first thing he had told his mother upon their reunification was: ""I defeated captivity."" Hisham al-Sayed, 37,is a Bedouin Arab Israeli who had been held by Hamas since he entered Gaza on his own in 2015. Hamas said he and Avera Mengistu were soldiers, but Israeli documents seen by Human Rights Watch show that both were civilians exempted from military service. Hisham's family said he was diagnosed with schizophrenia and entered Gaza while in mental distress.

However, after their bodies handed over, the Israeli military's spokesman said post-mortem exams and intelligence showed the boys had been murdered by their captors ""with their bare hands"". The Israeli prime minister said later that Shiri was also murdered. At the start of February 2024, Shiri's husband, Yarden Bibas, was released by Hamas without his immediate family.

In January 2025, the body of Yousef Zyadna, a 53-year-old Bedouin dairy farmer, was found by the Israeli military in an underground tunnel in the southern Rafah area.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4gdx1rpel6o,Israel confirms Hamas handed over hostages' bodies as Palestinian prisoners released,2025-02-27T12:39:05.198Z,David Gritten & George Wright,"Israel has completed forensic tests confirming the identities of four dead Israeli hostages whose bodies were handed over by Hamas in exchange for the release of Palestinian prisoners. On Wednesday night, Hamas passed four coffins to the Red Cross from Gaza. Israel's prime minister confirmed on Thursday that they contained the remains of Shlomo Mansour, 86, Ohad Yahalomi, 50, Tsachi Idan, 50, and Itzik Elgarat, 69, and said all four men had been murdered. The handover cleared the way for the delayed release of more than 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees. It was the last exchange of the six-week-long first phase of the Gaza ceasefire deal, leaving questions over what happens next. Hamas has said it is ready to start delayed indirect negotiations on the second phase, which aims to end the war and secure the release of the remaining Israeli hostages. The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu - who faces pressures from his political allies to resume fighting and crush Hamas - said he had instructed negotiators to depart for Cairo on Thursday for talks. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy the Palestinian armed group in response to its unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. At least 48,365 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population of 2.1 million has been displaced multiple times. Almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed. The healthcare, water, sanitation, and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are severe shortages of food, fuel, medicine, and shelter. Hamas handed over the four men's bodies late on Wednesday night, with no public ceremony, unlike in previous exchanges during the current ceasefire. Israeli authorities carried out initial forensic testing close to the Israel-Gaza border before transferring the remains to the Abu Kabir Institute of Forensic Medicine in Tel Aviv. It came after the body of a Palestinian woman from Gaza was handed over by Hamas to Israel instead of the body of hostage Shiri Bibas last week, prompting fury in Israel. Hamas said it was a mistake and transferred Bibas's body the following day. Following the identification of the bodies received overnight, the Israeli prime minister's office announced that military officials had informed the Mansour, Yahalomi, Idan and Elgarat families that their loved ones ""were murdered and have been returned for burial in Israel"". ""Pursuant to the intelligence and all of the information at our disposal, Ohad Yahalomi, Tsachi Idan and Itzik Elgarat were murdered while held hostage in Gaza,"" it added. ""Shlomo Mansour was murdered in the 7 October 2023 massacre and his body had been held in the Gaza Strip."" There was no immediate response to the allegations from Hamas. Tsachi Idan was taken by Hamas gunmen from his home in Nahal Oz, a kibbutz near the Gaza border on 7 October 2023. His eldest child, Maayan - who had just turned 18 - was shot and killed in front of her siblings and parents. His family said that ""the unbearable journey to bring back our beloved and dear Tsachi from the inferno in Gaza has ended with the identification of his body"". Itzik Elgarat was kidnapped from Nir Oz, another kibbutz, and reportedly shot in the hand during the attack. Ohad Yahalomi, a French-Israeli dual national, was abducted from Nir Oz, along with his 12-year-old son, Eitan, who was released during a week-long ceasefire in November 2023. Iraq-born Shlomo Mansour was killed by Hamas at Kibbutz Kissufim on 7 October 2023 and his body was taken to Gaza as a hostage. His sister, Hadassah Lazar, told Israel's Channel 12 that ""we've reached an absurd situation where we take comfort in receiving a body to bury"". But, she added: ""The circle is not yet closed. We will continue fighting until the last hostage returns home."" President Isaac Herzog said: ""Together with the entire nation, we share in the immense grief and sorrow of the bereaved families and [their] communities. ""The return of our brothers' bodies from captivity underscores our moral obligation to do everything in our power to bring back all the hostages - the living to their loving families, and the fallen to be late to rest."" The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents the hostages' families, insisted that Ohad Yahalomi, Tsachi Idan and Itzik Elgarat could have returned alive if the Israeli government had agreed to the ceasefire deal sooner. ""[They] endured a prolonged period in Hamas captivity in Gaza. They should have returned alive; they could have been saved and brought back through an agreement."" It urged Israel's leaders to ensure the return of the 59 hostages remaining in captivity - 35 of whom are presumed dead - by the start of next week, warning that they ""have no time left"". Netanyahu promised Israeli authorities would ""act relentlessly until we bring everyone back"". Following the handover of the hostages' bodies, buses carrying Palestinian prisoners were seen leaving Ofer prison in the north of the occupied West Bank and then arriving in Ramallah, where a large crowd gathered to celebrate their release. ""We have been taken out of suffering as if we have been dug out from our own graves. No prisoner has had the experience of having their own release delayed twice,"" one of the prisoners, Yahya Shrida, told reporters. ""What we have been through is a situation that the mountains can't carry. It is very hard to explain."" Later, dozens more Palestinians were seen getting off buses outside the European Gaza hospital in Khan Younis, southern Gaza. Many of them said they had endured harsh conditions while in detention. ""During the first period in jail, we were handcuffed and blindfolded for 90 days, you see no-one and no-one sees us. And we used to sit on our knees or on our buttocks for 18 or 20 hours,"" Eyad al-Saudi said. He added: ""We left behind young detainees, and our joy will not be complete until the remaining detained prisoners are released from prison."" The Israeli military and prison service have previously said that detainees and prisoners are treated in accordance with the law. The Palestinian Prisoners Media Office said a total of 642 Palestinians in Israeli jails were supposed to be released in the exchange. Among them were 445 Gazans who were detained by Israeli forces without charge during the war and 46 women and children, it said. The 151 prisoners include dozens convicted of carrying out deadly attacks on Israelis who are being sent abroad. Israel had delayed the releases since last Saturday in protest at what it said were ""Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes"". Hamas said Israel's decision was a ""blatant"" violation and said indirect talks about further steps in the ceasefire deal were conditional on the prisoners being released. After days of impasse, Egyptian mediators secured the new exchange, with the Israeli prime minister's office saying the hostages' bodies would be handed over ""in an agreed-upon procedure and without Hamas ceremonies"". A Hamas official meanwhile said the handover would take place ""without public presence to prevent the occupation from finding any pretext for delay or obstruction"". It remains unclear whether the truce will be extended or progress to a planned second phase, which would see the release of all remaining living hostages in Gaza in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners. Indirect negotiations for the second phase were due to start earlier this month but they have not yet got under way. Hamas affirmed the group's ""full commitment to the ceasefire agreement"" on Thursday and its ""readiness to enter into negotiations for the second phase"". Later, the Israeli prime minister's office said he had ""instructed the negotiation delegation to depart for Cairo today to continue the talks"", without giving any details. ""Our delegation will go to Cairo and see whether we have a common ground to negotiate,"" Foreign Minister Gideon Saar told reporters. ""We said we are ready to make the framework longer in return to release more hostages. If it is possible we'll do that."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2d437ddp28o,Israel and Hamas exchange to take place after ceasefire impasse resolved,2025-02-26T20:48:19.299Z,David Gritten,"Israel and Hamas say the bodies of four Israeli hostages held in Gaza will be returned on Wednesday night, after mediators resolved the latest ceasefire dispute. Israel is set to free in exchange 602 Palestinian prisoners, whose release it had delayed since last weekend in protest at what it said was the cruel treatment of hostages being handed over by Hamas. The Israeli prime minister's office announced the four bodies would be returned ""without Hamas ceremonies"", while the Israel Prison Service said it was preparing to free prisoners and detainees from Gaza. Hamas also confirmed the exchange, and the Prisoners' Media Office said a hospital in Gaza was preparing to receive released Palestinians. This would clear the way for US Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff to visit the region. He has said he wants Israel and Hamas to begin delayed talks on the second stage of the ceasefire, with the first due to expire on Saturday. News of the breakthrough came as thousands of Israelis gathered along roads in central and southern Israel to watch the funeral procession of hostages Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir, whose bodies were returned by Hamas last week. They were killed in captivity after being kidnapped during Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, which triggered the war in Gaza. Israel has said they were murdered by their captors, rejecting Hamas's claim that they died in an Israeli air strike. On Tuesday night, Hamas said a delegation led by the group's Gaza leader, Khalil al-Hayya, had concluded talks with Egyptian officials in Cairo after reaching an agreement to resolve the problem over the delayed release of the Palestinian prisoners. ""They will be released simultaneously with the bodies of the Israeli [hostages] agreed to be handed over during the first phase, in addition to the corresponding Palestinian women and children,"" it added. Hayya also reiterated that Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK, and other countries - was committed to the ceasefire deal ""with all its stages and clauses"". Israeli officials also said an agreement had been reached with the mediators, but it was not until Wednesday afternoon that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office put out a brief statement confirming that. ""Four of our deceased hostages will be returned tonight in the framework of the first stage, in an agreed-upon procedure and without Hamas ceremonies,"" it said, without naming them. The spokesman of Hamas's military wing later announced: ""Within the framework of the deal, the Izzedine al-Qassam Brigades has decided to hand over the bodies of four [hostages] tonight."" He identified them as Shlomo Mansour, 86, Ohad Yahalomi, 50, Tsachi Idan, 50, and Itzik Elgarat, 69. The Israel Prison Service confirmed it was ""making preparations for the process of releasing imprisoned terrorists in accordance with the agreement"". Operational units would escort the Palestinian prisoners and detainees to Ofer prison in the occupied West Bank, and Ketziot prison in southern Israel, where they would be identified by the Red Cross and await the handover of the Israeli hostages, a statement said. Once their release was approved, they would be driven by the Red Cross to release points in the West Bank and the Kerem Shalom crossing with southern Gaza, it added. The Palestinian Prisoners' Media Office meanwhile said the European Gaza Hospital in the southern city of Khan Younis was preparing to receive those returned to Gaza. It has previously said the 602 Palestinians include 445 Gazans detained by Israeli forces during the war and 50 prisoners serving life sentences in Israeli jails. They should have been released last Saturday in return for six living and four dead hostages who had been handed over by Hamas, including Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas. However, the Israeli prime minister's office said early on Sunday that the release would be postponed ""in light of Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes"". Hamas said Israel's decision was a ""blatant"" violation and said indirect talks about further steps, including on the deal's second phase, were conditional on the prisoners being released. A total of 33 Israeli hostages are supposed to be exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza during the ceasefire deal's first phase lasting six weeks. So far, 25 living hostages and four dead hostages have been released. Both Israel and Hamas have said the last four hostages are dead. Five living Thai hostages have also been freed outside of the deal. The agreement has seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been allowed to return to the north, and hundreds of aid lorries are now being allowed into the territory each day. The ceasefire's second phase should see the 59 remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal from Gaza, and a permanent ceasefire. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the 7 October attack, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. At least 48,348 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population of 2.1 million has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g039ergplo,'It'll be a disaster': Uncertainty for thousands forced from West Bank camps by Israeli raids,2025-02-26T18:25:12.553Z,Paul Adams,"""The army forced us out. Me, my wife and family. We took nothing with us."" Alaa Ofi is trying to figure out how to manage his drastically changed circumstances. ""We left behind our documents, clothes and everything we had at home."" It's been a month since the Israeli army raided the Tulkarm refugee camp, causing thousands of residents to flee. At the local Palestinian governor's office we found displaced camp residents looking for assistance. Some were struggling to find affordable places to rent. Others, like Mr Ofi, needed to retrieve important belongings but had been prevented from returning to their homes by the Israeli army. ""My wife is expecting a baby next week,"" Mr Ofi said. ""I can't take her to hospital because I need insurance papers and my ID, but they were left behind at home."" What Israel is calling ""Operation Iron Wall"" against Palestinian armed groups has triggered an exodus of around 40,000 people from four camps in the north of the occupied West Bank: Tulkarm, Nur Shams, Jenin and Far'a. Aid agencies are calling it the largest forced displacement of Palestinians in the West Bank since it was captured by Israeli forces during the 1967 Six Day War. It's also the first time any of the camps, which were established in the early 1950s for Palestinians who fled or were driven from their homes during Israel's War of Independence, have been almost completely evacuated. Since the operation began in January, Israeli forces have ploughed up roads and demolished homes. On the eastern edge of Tulkarm camp, a broad scar is visible where once there were tightly packed houses. Israeli soldiers can be seen patrolling what now looks like a street. Elsewhere, roads into the camp have been churned up, armoured bulldozers creating piles of earth and pools of muddy rainwater. Pavements and shop fronts have been left mangled. A concrete UN sign that used to stand over the camp's now impassable main entrance has been knocked down. At least 51 Palestinians, including seven children, have been killed by Israeli forces in the northern West Bank since the beginning of the operation, according to the UN. Three soldiers have also been killed by Palestinian gunmen, one of them during an exchange of fire in Jenin and two others in an attack on a checkpoint in Tubas, it says. The Israeli army says it's tackling Palestinian militant groups, based inside the camps - groups it blames for a string of roadside bomb attacks on Israeli soldiers and civilians. On Sunday, Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, said the army was ""at war with Islamic terrorism in Judea and Samaria"" - the term Israel uses to describe the West Bank. He said he had instructed the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) ""to prepare for a prolonged stay in the camps that have been cleared for the coming year"". At the same time, Katz ordered tanks to take up positions in Jenin camp and the surrounding city, for the first time in more than 20 years. Beyond underlining the government's tough message, it's not clear what role the four tanks will perform. ""The IDF is operating within very complex urban environments,"" a military official said, on condition of anonymity. ""We've done that in Gaza, we've done that in the villages of southern Lebanon,"" the official said, referring to Israel's wars with Hamas and Hezbollah. ""We're doing that in those neighbourhoods in Judea and Samaria because of the threat that we're facing."" Military officials say there have been no orders to evacuate civilians. ""The IDF has allowed local residents who wish to distance themselves from combat areas to leave safely through designated crossings,"" the army said in a statement. But residents of the camps say they were forced to leave, some of them under fire. Others say instructions to leave were delivered by drone. One video from Jenin shows a drone flying over the camp, seemingly broadcasting a message. ""Get out of your homes, the army will be here,"" the message says. The recently-appointed Palestinian governor of Tulkarm, Dr Abdullah Kmeil, calls Operation Iron Wall ""a declaration of war"". ""You are talking about an operation of destruction,"" he told the BBC. ""Financial and mental destruction of the residents. These are things the Israelis have planned precisely."" The aim, he says, is to create ""a hostile environment"" for the camps' residents, in the hope that they leave and are absorbed into the general Palestinian population. In the meantime, Palestinians find themselves struggling with a host of new difficulties, large and small. In the village of Qabatiya, just south of Jenin, we found a driver frantically trying to reverse out of a muddy pothole left by Israeli bulldozers that had dug up the street. His car was stuck in the middle of the road, holding up traffic in both directions. In the centre of a nearby roundabout, a miniature replica of Jerusalem's iconic Dome of the Rock had been smashed to pieces. Despite Israel Katz's warning, no-one knows how long the operation, and the restrictions on civilians, will last. ""If we can't go back to our house for a year, it's going to be a disaster,"" says Alaa Ofi. ""We'll be left stranded in the streets with the kids."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg178g4nrwo,Israelis pay last respects to hostage mother and sons killed in Gaza,2025-02-26T17:34:46.456Z,Yolande Knell,"In a display of deep public grief, thousands of Israelis, many with orange balloons and Israeli flags, lined the roads of southern Israel for the funeral procession of three hostages who were killed in captivity in Gaza - Shiri Bibas, and her two red-haired sons, Ariel and Kfir. Israeli TV channels carried a live feed of the scenes and - after a private burial - the public eulogies by relatives, with crowds gathering to watch on large screens in Tel Aviv's Hostages' Square. ""This trio settled in my heart, and I believe in all of our hearts,"" a woman called Neta told Channel 12. She said she had come from the north to pay her final respects to the Bibas family at the procession. ""I set out this morning at 04:30. I saw that I couldn't fall asleep, so I headed south. I wanted to come here to be as close as possible to the Gaza border communities, to be part of this farewell."" Kfir, aged nine months, from Kibbutz Nir Oz, was the youngest of the 251 hostages snatched in the Hamas-led 7 October 2023 attacks. His brother, Ariel, was just four. Images of the two boys became among the most recognisable symbols of the struggle to return the hostages. There was deep anguish in Israel at the sight of Yarden Bibas, Shiri's husband, being released by Hamas at the start of this month without his immediate family. On Wednesday, Yarden Bibas paid tribute to Shiri, who was 32, as ""the most amazing wife and mother"", saying he would always love her. ""I want to tell you everything that's happening in the world and here in Israel,"" he went on. ""Shiri, everyone knows us and loves us. You have no idea how surreal this madness is."" Wearing an orange kippah, or skullcap, he shared touching memories of his children and spoke of how he and his wife had been happily surprised on giving birth to their second red-headed boy. The Israeli president's residence was lit up in orange - the colour that has come to represent the family. At the procession's start, the Bibas family thanked Israelis for their show of support and expressed longing for days ""when we can once again gather in moments of joy, not sorrow"". Wrapped in an orange flag to watch the convoy of cars passing en route to the cemetery, Shontal expressed sympathy with the bereaved. ""I wanted to come and be close to them, to offer my condolences to Yarden and the family. I hope he manages to recover - not only from the captivity he endured but also from grasping and understanding this terrible tragedy,"" she told Channel 12. ""His tragedy is all of ours."" A haunting video of Shiri Bibas was filmed during the Hamas assault in southern Israel over 16 months ago. She appears terrified as she clutches onto her children surrounded by armed men before they are taken away from their home. Hours later, surveillance camera footage showed them in Khan Younis. In November 2023, Hamas said that an Israeli air strike in Gaza had killed Shiri and her sons. However, that was never verified by the Israeli military, which only expressed ""serious concern"" for them. As recently as last week, the Bibas family continued to hold out hope that the mother and her sons could be returned to Israel alive. They asked the public to ""refrain from eulogising our loved ones"" until a government post-mortem examination was completed. Then, last Friday, after the first handover of the remains of dead hostages by Hamas since its deadly 2023 attack, under the terms of the Gaza ceasefire deal, news came through that devastated many Israelis. The Bibas boys were dead, their identities confirmed by DNA tests. The Israeli military spokesman said pathological exams and intelligence showed they had been murdered by their captors ""with their bare hands"". In addition, the remains of Shiri Bibas were not found in the coffin labelled with her name that had been handed to the International Committee of the Red Cross. This was said to contain the remains of a Palestinian woman from Gaza instead. Hamas suggested that there may have been a mix up in the aftermath of the Israeli bombardment. Two days later, the Bibas family announced that Shiri's body had been returned to Israel and that she too had been murdered in captivity. The upsetting confusion over the bodies, along with the grim handover ceremony for the dead hostages staged by Hamas, were among what Israel said were truce violations, leading it to postpone the agreed release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners last Saturday. Hamas responded that this was a ""serious violation"" by Israel which threw the ceasefire process into a new crisis. Hours before the funeral, Israeli and Hamas officials said the crisis had been resolved by mediators, with the bodies of another four Israeli hostages now expected to be returned later on Wednesday or on Thursday at the same time as the Palestinian prisoners are freed. However, the fallout triggered fresh anxiety for the relatives of some 60 remaining hostages who remain unsure if their loved ones - or their bodies - will ever be returned from Gaza. A pledge by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to avenge the Bibas family's deaths only increased their relatives' worries. The family have criticised the Israeli media and Netanyahu for ignoring their wishes not to release more details of the circumstances of their loved ones' deaths. In a Facebook post on the eve of the funeral, Ofri Bibas Levy, the sister of Yarden Bibas, told the prime minister to ""shut up"" after he repeatedly described the murders. She said publication of the information was ""outright abuse of a family that has gone through 16 months of hell and still has the worst ahead"". The Bibas funeral came a day after that of Oded Lifshitz, who was also from Nir Oz and was 83 when he was abducted. His body was also returned last week. Netanyahu has said he was murdered in captivity by Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Shiri Bibas and her children were buried in a single casket next to the final resting place of her parents, Yossi and Margit Silberman, who lived in the same kibbutz and were killed there on 7 October. In total, some 1,200 people were killed on Israel's deadliest ever day. It ignited the deadliest ever war in Gaza, in which more than 48,000 people have been killed, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. At the funeral, Ofri Bibas Levy called on Israeli officials seeking forgiveness for their failure to protect Shiri, Ariel and Kfir that day to instead hold themselves accountable. ""Forgiveness means accepting responsibility and committing to act differently, to learn from mistakes. There is no meaning to forgiveness before the failures are investigated, and all officials take responsibility. ""Our disaster as a nation and as a family should not have happened, and must never happen again."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0w0x28yxo,'We are still at war': Syria's Kurds battle Turkey months after Assad's fall,2025-02-26T00:59:59.869Z,Jiyar Gol,"To reach north-east Syria, we cross a rickety floating bridge over the River Tigris. Our minibus rattles as it takes us from Iraqi Kurdistan through Syrian oil fields, where jacks pumping crude oil line the roads. This part of Syria is controlled by Kurds, who call it Rojava - meaning western Kurdistan. Since 2012, after the outbreak of civil war, they have run it as a self-declared autonomous region, protected by Kurdish-led armed forces. But Bashar al-Assad's regime never recognised it and, despite his fall from power, its future remains uncertain. As well as more than a decade of civil war, the Syrian Kurds have faced years of conflict with its northern neighbour, Turkey - a battle they are still fighting. A decade ago, the Islamic State group (IS) swept through this region, capturing cities and villages with little resistance - until it reached the city of Kobane, next to the Turkish border, in September 2014. IS militants didn't manage to enter the city, but they imposed a brutal siege that lasted for months. Kurdish-led factions, supported by the US-led military coalition, broke the siege in early 2015. This January, I join the city's residents as they mark the 10-year anniversary. At the entrance to Kobane, women in their 50s, armed with AK-47 assault rifles, guard the checkpoints. Women played a crucial role in the fight against IS - many volunteered in the all-female Women's Protection Units (YPJ).  As we drive around the city, the scars of war are still visible, along with posters of young men and women who lost their lives. But in the main square, the mood is festive. Young girls and boys, dressed in colourful Kurdish outfits dance hand in hand, singing as they celebrate. For the older generation, though, it is a bittersweet moment. ""Last night I lit candles for my martyred brother and others killed in Kobane,"" says Newrouz Ahmad, a 45-year-old mother of four. ""It is a joyful day, but also a painful one. I wish he was here to see it."" The Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) declared victory over IS in north-east Syria in 2019. But freedom from IS hasn't brought lasting peace. Turkey and a coalition of Turkish-backed rebel groups known as the Syrian National Army (SNA) have launched several military operations against SDF-controlled territories since 2016, and captured a swathe of territory running along hundreds of kilometres of the border. Turkey considers the largest component in the SDF - the People's Protection Units (YPG) - an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish rights in Turkey for decades and is listed by Ankara as a terrorist organisation. The country wants to push the SDF back from its border. As the Assad regime collapsed in late 2024, the Turkish-backed SNA launched a new offensive to capture territory west of the River Euphrates from the SDF. Now battles have reached areas near Kobane. A Kurdish commander in the city quietly tells me: ""Don't film here, we have built tunnels beneath the city to prepare for another siege."" In the city, the smell of gasoline fills the air, and the deafening sound of generators can be heard everywhere. Locals tell me that most of the power stations, refineries, and even telecommunications antennas have been destroyed by Turkish air strikes over the past two years. Newrouz Ahmad says that having ""defeated IS in Kobane… we won't allow Turkey and its proxies to occupy our city, we will defeat them too"". At a restaurant, the moment people realise we are not locals, they surround us. I ask an old man with grey hair and a stick in his hands how old he is. I guess he is about 80, but the answer he gives embarrasses me. ""I am 60,"" he says. It's clear that people here have been exhausted by war, having witnessed so much death and bloodshed. And now the threat of another battle is looming. Turkish-made drones and Turkish jets have targeted SDF positions and supply routes around the city. Even civilians protesting have been hit. In a regional hospital, I find one of the wounded - Lea Bunse, a 28-year-old German peace activist who has been volunteering at a women's shelter in Rojava for over two years. She shows me a video of an attack on a demonstration she says she was part of in January. The footage shows two projectiles dropping from the sky and hitting a crowd of people dancing. The protest was held near the strategic Tishreen Dam, where fighting has been ongoing. The SDF says six civilians were killed, and dozens more injured. ""An old man next to me was also injured,"" she tells me from her bed. ""I lost some blood… but when we got into the ambulance, another drone attack was carried out next to our ambulance,"" she adds. Human Rights Watch has condemned an attack that hit a Kurdish Red Crescent ambulance as an ""apparent war crime"" by the Turkish-SNA coalition. The Turkish foreign ministry told the BBC that ""reports claiming Turkey is involved in the attacks against civilians and critical infrastructure do not reflect the truth"" adding that the SDF sends civilians to a ""conflict-ridden area on purpose"" to use them as ""human shields… in order to not to lose control on the said dam"". It accused the SDF of using ""violence and terror"" to pursue ""its own separatist agenda"", violating a ceasefire and stopping technical teams from getting access to the dam for repairs. Syria's new leader, Ahmad al-Sharaa, is stuck between a rock and a hard place. The interim president - whose Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad - has been promising to form an inclusive government in Damascus, and he has asked all armed factions to lay down their weapons. Negotiations are reportedly being held with the SDF to find a solution for the north-east. But the inclusion of the Kurdish factions puts Sharaa in a difficult position with one of his main allies – Turkey. And when Sharaa opened a conference for national dialogue on Syria's future on Tuesday, the Kurdish autonomous administration was absent - it said it had not been invited. Speaking to me from a discreet location near an American base in Hassakeh province in the north-east of Syria, SDF commander Gen Mazloum Abdi tells me he has met Sharaa in Damascus before. But the two sides have still not reached an agreement. ""In reality, we are still at war with Turkey and its proxies. Turkish jets and drones continue to bomb us,"" he says, adding: ""In Damascus, it remains unclear what steps the new government will take. Their statements are positive, but they are under pressure from Turkey to act against the areas under our control. ""But the US, France, and some Arab nations are pushing them to recognize Kurdish rights,"" he says. For the US, SDF fighters have been the most reliable allies in the fight against IS. Today, hundreds of US troops remain in Kurdish-controlled areas, to counter IS sleeper cells. But the Kurds now fear President Donald Trump might withdraw these troops, leaving the region vulnerable to any Turkish military operation, and a possible IS resurgence. It's estimated that there are still about 40,000 IS family members and up to 10,000 jihadist fighters held in SDF-controlled camps and prisons in the north-east, says Gen Abdi. ""If Turkey attacks, we will have no choice but to redirect our forces,"" he warns. ""That would give IS an opportunity to attack prisons and free its fighters."" There is further uncertainty for the women who fought against IS in the all-female YPJ ranks. The walls in the office of 29-year-old YPJ spokesperson Roksana Mohamed are covered with pictures of fellow female commanders killed in battle. ""So far, we haven't seen any roles given to women in Damascus' new leadership,"" she says. ""Why shouldn't a woman be defence minister?"" Ms Mohamed says women fought for their rights in this region. They have been actively involved in every aspect of political, social, and military life. ""If our rights are not respected, how can we be expected to lay down our arms?"" she asks. So while some believe stability in Syria is on the horizon, for the Kurds, the future remains unclear. Will they be recognised as partners in a new Syria, or face another existential battle?"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c62k676gk34o,"Six babies have died from cold in Gaza over two weeks, medics say",2025-02-25T21:31:42.406Z,David Gritten,"At least six babies have died in the past two weeks in Gaza due to the cold weather and lack of adequate shelter and heating, Palestinian medics and health officials say. Doctors at the Patient's Friends Benevolent Society hospital in Gaza City, in the north, said nine newborn babies suffering from cold injuries had been admitted, five of whom had died, with one other in a critical condition. The family of a two-month-old girl also said she had died due to the cold near the southern city of Khan Younis overnight. The PFBS hospital called for the urgent delivery of caravans and fuel to improve conditions for the estimated 945,000 displaced Palestinians living in tents and makeshift shelters. The Palestinian armed group Hamas has accused Israel of failing to allow in agreed amounts of tents, caravans and other shelter supplies during a ceasefire that began five weeks ago. Israel has denied this. Most of Gaza's 2.1 million population has been displaced multiple times during the 16-month war between Israel and Hamas and almost 70% of buildings in the territory are estimated to be damaged or destroyed. The healthcare system has also collapsed, with only 18 of the 35 hospitals partially functional and shortages of essential medical equipment. According to meteorological websites, the night-time temperature in Gaza has regularly fallen below 10C (50F) over the past two weeks. It dropped to 3C (37F) on Monday night, after the PFBS hospital's medical director Dr Saeed Salah had warned in a video that three babies suffering from cold injuries, including hypothermia, had died over the same period. He said the babies were only one or two days old, and had weighed between 1.7kg and 2kg (3.7-4.4lbs). On Tuesday, Dr Salah and a paediatrician at the hospital, Dr Samer Lubad, reported that another two newborns had died. ""The last several weeks we [had] nine neonates in our hospital. And they came with case that they call 'cold injury' or hypothermia,"" Dr Lubad told Al Jazeera TV. ""Three babies survived and were treated successfully and discharged home. There is still one baby in our neonatal ICU in a critical general condition."" He added: ""Of course, this condition is because of the cold weather and lack of safe shelters, lack of central heating, and lack of electricity in the Gaza Strip."" Meanwhile, the head of the paediatric department at the Nasser Hospital in Khan Younis told the Associated Press that it had received the body of a two-month-old girl who had died of hypothermia on Tuesday. A video posted by a local journalist appeared to show the girl being buried by her father and uncle, who said she was named Sham Yousef al-Shambari. He said she had been healthy and that her mother had found her ""stiff as wood from the cold"" when she tried to wake her for feeding during the night inside the family's tent in the al-Mawasi area. Dr Muneer al-Boursh, director general of the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza, said in a statement a total of 15 children had died due to the cold since the start of the winter. He also alleged that Israel had ""failed to comply with humanitarian protocols, including allowing the entry of medical equipment, heating supplies, tents, and mobile homes"" since the ceasefire began on 19 January. Hamas has previously said that Israel was required to allow in about 300,000 tents and 60,000 caravans during the six-week-long first phase of the deal. Israeli military body Cogat said Israel was ""committed to and complies with the obligation to allow the entry of 4,200 humanitarian aid trucks per week"" into Gaza, including those carrying tents and shelter supplies. ""Based on the data available to us, hundreds of thousands of tents have entered the Gaza Strip since the agreement came into effect,"" it added. It comes amid continued uncertainty over whether the ceasefire will continue past Saturday, when the deal's first phase is set to expire. On Sunday, Israel postponed the release of some 600 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in exchange for 10 hostages who had been handed over by Hamas, accusing the group of cynically using its hostages for propaganda purposes. Hamas accused Israel of a ""blatant"" violation of the deal and said indirect talks about further steps, including on the deal's second phase, were conditional on the prisoners being released. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. At least 48,348 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's health ministry."

Ahmed al-Sharaa also stressed the need for armed groups to integrate into the military and for the state to have a monopoly on weapons, saying Syria's ""strength lies in its unity"". The 600 delegates have been asked to provide recommendations on transitional justice, the economy, the new constitution and other topics to guide a new transitional government. But there has been criticism that the process has been rushed, and the Kurdish-led militia alliance and autonomous administration which control north-eastern Syria were not invited. The Assad family ruled Syria for more than 50 years with an iron fist, with Bashar becoming president in 2000 after the death of his father Hafez. In 2011, Bashar brutally crushed a peaceful pro-democracy uprising, sparking a devastating civil war in which more than 600,000 people were killed and 12 million others forced to flee their homes. On 8 December, he fled to Russia after a rebel alliance led by Sharaa's Islamist group Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) swept down from north-western Syria and entered Damascus in the space of only 12 days. Seven weeks later, Sharaa was named president for the ""transitional period"" by his fellow rebel commanders. They also announced the cancellation of the 2012 constitution, the dissolution of the parliament, army and security agencies, and the integration of all rebel groups into the new state institutions replacing them. Sharaa promised to hold a national dialogue conference to discuss Syria's future, which he said would be followed by a ""constitutional declaration"" to serve during the transition. ""Syria liberated itself on its own, and it suits it to build itself on its own,"" Sharaa said in a speech at the national dialogue conference in Damascus on Tuesday. ""What we are living today is an exceptional, historic and rare opportunity. We must take advantage of every moment of it to serve the interests of our people and our country."" The organising committee said six working groups would be formed to discuss a transitional justice system, the new constitution, reforming and building state institutions, personal freedoms, the role of civil society, and the country's future economic model. The groups would agree non-binding recommendations, which would be presented to the new transitional government set to take power on Saturday and help shape the constitutional declaration, according to the committee. Sharaa said a transitional justice body would soon be formed to ""restore people's rights"" and start holding to account those who committed crimes against Syrians during the civil war. He also reiterated that non-state armed groups had to disarm and hand over their territory. ""The unity of arms and their monopoly by the state is not a luxury but a duty and an obligation,"" he said. ""Syria is indivisible; it is a complete whole, and its strength lies in its unity."" The interim government's forces control Syria's biggest cities, but large parts of the country are still held by various armed groups. They include the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a militia alliance supported by the US, which controls most of the north-east and serves as the armed forces of the Autonomous Administration of North and East Syria (AANES). The SDF has so far refused to integrate its forces into the new Syrian army, although negotiations have been taking place in recent weeks. Organisers of the conference said the SDF and AANES had not been invited because of that refusal, and that Kurds would be represented in Damascus even if they were not. However, SDF spokesman Farhad Shami told AFP news agency that ""the exclusion of the SDF and large sections of Syrian society confirm that the conference serves to please the outside world and not to seek a better future"". Thirty-five parties in the AANES also criticised what they claimed was the ""token representation"" of Kurds and other minorities, saying such events were ""meaningless, worthless, and will not contribute to finding real solutions to the country's ongoing crisis"". Moutasem Sioufi of The Day After, an independent civil society group that is participating in the conference, told the BBC that it was important that all groups were involved. ""We need to have dialogue with all the Syrian groups, with all Syrian powers, especially those who have great influence on the ground. Without that Syria would face a very hard time maintaining itself together,"" he said. The outcomes of the conference will be closely watched by the international community, which has called for an inclusive political process that represents the country's many ethnic and religious communities. During the civil war, the US, the UK, and the European Union imposed a wide range of sanctions on Syria targeting Assad's government and its allies in response to atrocities committed during the civil war. They have lifted some of the sanctions that crippled the Syrian economy since Assad's fall, but made further steps dependent on Syria's new leaders keeping promises to respect minority rights and move towards democracy. On Monday, the EU announced that it was suspending sanctions on its energy, transport and banking sectors to facilitate humanitarian assistance and reconstruction. Syrian Foreign Minister Asaad al-Shibani welcomed that decision, but he criticised the international sanctions still in place in a speech to the national dialogue conference. ""These sanctions are illegitimate and are not based on any legal or moral foundations,"" he said. ""They are being used as a means of pressure on the will of the Syrian people."" HTS, a former al-Qaeda affiliate, is subject to separate sanctions because it continues to be proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UN, US, EU and UK."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgenz02lp8o,Israel demands complete demilitarisation of southern Syria,2025-02-24T21:31:48.351Z,Sebastian Usher,"Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has demanded the complete demilitarisation of much of southern Syria. It is an announcement that could make conflict between Israel and the new leadership in Syria, after the toppling of President Bashar al-Assad, more likely. In a speech to Israeli military cadets on Sunday, Netanyahu said that Israel would not allow the forces of Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) - the Islamist group that led the overthrow of Assad - nor the new Syrian army that is being formed to ""enter the area south of Damascus"". ""We demand the complete demilitarisation of southern Syria in the provinces of Quneitra, Deraa and Suweida from the forces of the new regime,"" he added. ""Likewise, we will not tolerate any threat to the Druze community in southern Syria."" He also said that Israeli forces would remain indefinitely inside the Syrian territory that they have seized since Assad's fall last December - which would be a shift in Israeli strategy. Until now, Israel had described its move into a UN-monitored demilitarised buffer zone in the Golan Heights as a temporary measure to ensure the security of Israelis on the other side. The rationale appeared to be to prevent extremist groups from moving down to the Golan in the power vacuum. But with his latest comments, Netanyahu has made it clear that he believes that the new authorities in Syria - with their background in jihadism - could represent a similar danger. Israel seized most of the Golan from Syria during the 1967 Middle East war and later annexed. The move was not recognised internationally, although the US did so in 2019. Syria's new interim President, HTS leader Ahmed al-Sharaa, has tried to reassure Israel that he does not want conflict and that he is ready to uphold the long-standing disengagement agreement between the two countries concluded after another war in 1973. He has also stressed that he will not allow Syria to be used as a base for attacks against Israel. But Sharaa has also called on Israel to withdraw from the buffer zone it has taken, as he tries to assert sovereignty across the whole of Syria's fractured landscape. Clearly, Netanyahu does not trust these assurances. Like much of the international community, the Israeli prime minister is waiting to see if Sharaa makes good on his moderate, emollient stance in action as well as words. From the perspective of the new Syrian leadership, freeing the country from the influence of all the foreign powers that jockeyed for position during the long years of civil war is seen as vital to ensuring a more positive future for the country and a definitive break with the past. Some foreign players, such as Iran and Russia, have seen for now at least the curtailment of the overweening influence they once had. Under President Donald Trump, the US might also further disengage from Syria - a role which has helped underpin Kurdish-led forces in the north-east of the country. There has, though, been growing influence from Turkey - which provided essential support for HTS in its lightning campaign against Assad. How big a part it chooses to play could be a determining factor in how Syria develops in the post-Assad era. But Israel may present a more immediate challenge to the independence of Syria's new leadership. To have Israeli troops increasingly infringing on the country's territory - as well as carrying out numerous strikes on targets associated with what's left of Assad's military arsenal - does not fit with the vision of a re-unified, sovereign state that Sharaa is trying to convince Syrians both inside and outside the country that his leadership can provide. Netanyahu's move to forbid Syrian forces from operating freely within the country's borders may be a step too far for the new order in Damascus to stomach, however non-confrontational an image it is trying to maintain."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgw7rrlvmjo,Hamas says no Gaza ceasefire talks unless Israel releases prisoners,2025-02-24T16:12:21.962Z,David Gritten,"Hamas says talks with Israel about further steps in the Gaza ceasefire deal are conditional on Palestinian prisoners being freed as agreed. Israel said on Sunday it was delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinians in return for six living and four dead hostages who had been freed, accusing Hamas of repeated violations including ""humiliating"" handover ceremonies. A senior Hamas official said the decision exposed the entire agreement to ""grave danger"" and called on mediators, especially the US, to pressure Israel. The deal's first phase and temporary six-week truce is set to expire on Saturday but indirect negotiations on the second phase and an end to the war have not yet begun. UN Secretary General António Guterres warned that the ceasefire was ""precarious"" and that a resumption of hostilities must be avoided at all costs. He also called for the ""dignified release of all remaining hostages"". On Saturday - the start of the sixth and final week of the ceasefire deal's first phase - Hamas released six living Israeli hostages. As with many of the previous handovers, five of them were led onto stages beside armed fighters before being transferred to the Red Cross and then taken to Israel. Later, Hamas posted a video of two other hostages in a vehicle watching one of the handover ceremonies and appearing to plead with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to get them out too. A forum representing the hostages' families condemned the video as a ""sickening display of cruelty"". There was already fury in Israel after Hamas returned the bodies of four hostages earlier in the week, including those of Shiri Bibas and her two young sons Ariel and Kfir, who were abducted during the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel. It emerged on Friday that Hamas had handed over the remains of a Palestinian woman rather than those of Ms Bibas. The group said there had been a mistake and transferred Ms Bibas's body later that day. Israeli authorities also said a post-mortem had shown that Ariel and Kfir's captors killed the boys ""with their bare hands"", contradicting Hamas's claim that they died in an Israeli air strike. Israel was scheduled to free 620 Palestinian prisoners in exchange for the 10 hostages. More than 400 were Gazans detained by Israeli forces during the war, while 50 of the prisoners were serving life sentences in Israeli jails. They had reportedly already boarded buses at a prison in the occupied West Bank when the order came to suspend their release while Netanyahu consulted ministers. In the early hours of Sunday, the prime minister's office said the release would be postponed ""in light of Hamas's repeated violations, including the ceremonies that humiliate our hostages and the cynical exploitation of our hostages for propaganda purposes"". ""It has been decided to delay the release of terrorists that was planned for yesterday until the release of the next hostages has been assured, and without the humiliating ceremonies."" Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, UK and other countries - denounced Israel's decision as a ""blatant violation"" of the deal and warned US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators that there could be no talks on extending the ceasefire until the prisoners were released. ""We have conveyed a clear and strong message to the mediators - we cannot continue discussing any further steps if these 620 Palestinians are not released,"" Hamas political bureau member Basem Naim said in an interview with Al Jazeera on Monday. Asked if the scheduled release of the bodies of another four Israeli hostages on Thursday could be affected, he replied that ""all options are on the table"". ""Before going to the next step, we have to be sure that the past step [will happen],"" he added. ""Netanyahu is clearly sending strong messages that he is intentionally sabotaging the deal, he is preparing the atmosphere for returning back to the war. Therefore, what are the guarantees that he might take the other four bodies and again not release the agreed-upon number of Palestinians, plus the 620 Palestinians?"" Naim said Hamas had discussed Israel's complaints about the hostage handover ceremonies, but denied they had been humiliating and alleged that Israeli authorities had mistreated Palestinian prisoners before they were released. The White House backed Israel's decision to delay the prisoner release, saying it was an ""appropriate response"" to what it called the ""barbaric treatment"" of hostages by Hamas. But President Donald Trump's Middle East envoy, Steve Witkoff, said he would travel to the region this week with the aim of getting ""an extension of phase one"". ""We're hopeful that we have the proper time... to begin phase two, and finish it off and get more hostages released,"" he told CNN on Sunday. A total of 33 Israeli hostages are supposed to be exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza during the ceasefire deal's first phase. So far, 25 living hostages and four dead hostages have been released, while the bodies of the last four hostages are scheduled to be handed over this week. Five living Thai hostages have also been freed outside the deal. The agreement has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza. Hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians have been allowed to return to their homes in the north and hundreds of aid lorries are now being allowed into the territory each day. The ceasefire's second phase should see the remaining hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. At least 48,346 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g0dv7rxxvo,The unseen map that promised to bring peace to the Middle East,2025-02-24T01:04:43.214Z,Paul Adams,"""In the next 50 years, you will not find one Israeli leader that will propose to you what I propose to you now. ""Sign it! Sign it and let's change history!"" It was 2008. Israel's Prime Minister Ehud Olmert was imploring the Palestinian leader to accept a deal he believed could have brought peace to the Middle East. It was a two-state solution - a prospect which seems impossible today. If implemented, it would have created a Palestinian state on more than 94% of the occupied West Bank. The map Olmert had drawn up now has an almost mythical status. Various interpretations have appeared over the years, but he has never revealed it to the media. Until now. In Israel and the Palestinians: The Road to 7th October, the latest series from documentary filmmaker Norma Percy available on iPlayer from Monday, Olmert reveals the map he says he showed to Mahmoud Abbas at a meeting in Jerusalem on 16 September 2008. ""This is the first time that I expose this map to the media,"" he tells the filmmakers. It shows, in detail, the territory which Olmert proposed to annexe to Israel - 4.9% of the West Bank. That would have included major Jewish settlement blocs - just like previous proposals dating back to the late 1990s. In return, the prime minister said Israel would give up an equal amount of Israeli territory, along the edges of the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The two Palestinian territories would be connected via a tunnel or highway – again, something that had been discussed before. In the film, Olmert recalls the Palestinian leader's response. ""He said: 'Prime minister, this is very serious. It is very, very, very serious.'"" Crucially, Olmert's plan included a proposed solution to the thorny issue of Jerusalem. Each side would be able to claim parts of the city as their capital, while administration of the ""holy basin"" - including the Old City, with its religious sites, and adjacent areas - would be handed over to a committee of trustees consisting of Israel, Palestine, Saudi Arabia, Jordan and the US. The implications of the map, for Jewish settlements, would have been colossal. Had the plan been implemented, dozens of communities, scattered throughout the West Bank and Jordan Valley, would have been evacuated. When the previous Israeli prime minister, Ariel Sharon, forcibly removed a few thousand Jewish settlers from the Gaza Strip in 2005, it was regarded as a national trauma by those on the Israeli right. Evacuating most of the West Bank would have represented an infinitely greater challenge, involving tens of thousands of settlers, with the very real danger of violence. But the test never came. At the end of their meeting, Olmert refused to hand over a copy of the map to Mahmoud Abbas unless the Palestinian leader sign it. Abbas refused, saying that he needed to show his experts the map, to make sure they understood exactly what was being offered. Olmert says the two agreed to a meeting of map experts the following day. ""We parted, you know, like we are about to embark on a historic step forward,"" Olmert says. The meeting never happened. As they drove away from Jerusalem that night, President Abbas's chief of staff, Rafiq Husseini, remembers the atmosphere in the car. ""Of course, we laughed,"" he says in the film. The Palestinians believed the plan was dead in the water. Olmert, embroiled in an unrelated corruption scandal, had already announced that he was planning to resign. ""It is unfortunate that Olmert, regardless of how nice he was… was a lame duck,"" Husseini says, ""and therefore, we will go nowhere with this."" The situation in Gaza also complicated matters. After months of rocket attacks from the Hamas-controlled territory, Olmert ordered a major Israeli assault, Operation Cast Lead, at the end of December, triggering three weeks of intense fighting. But Olmert tells me it would have been ""very smart"" for Abbas to sign the deal. Then, if a future Israeli prime minister tried to cancel it, ""he could have said to the world that the failure was Israel's fault"". Israeli elections followed in February. Likud's Benjamin Netanyahu, a vocal opponent of Palestinian statehood, became prime minister. Olmert's plan, and map, faded from view. The former prime minister says he's still waiting for Abbas's reply, but his plan has since joined a long list of missed opportunities to end the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In 1973, the former Israeli diplomat, Abba Eban, quipped that the Palestinians ""never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity"". It's a phrase that Israeli officials have frequently repeated in the years since. But the world is more complicated than that, especially since the two sides signed the historic Oslo Accords in 1993. The peace process ushered in by a handshake on the White House lawn between former Israeli prime minister Yitzhak Rabin and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat had moments of genuine hope, punctuated by tragedy. Ultimately, it resulted in failure. The reasons are complex and there's plenty of blame to go around but in truth, the stars were never properly aligned. I witnessed this non-alignment at first hand 24 years ago. In January 2001, at the Egyptian resort of Taba, Israeli and Palestinian negotiators once again saw the outlines of a deal. A member of the Palestinian delegation drew a rough map on a napkin and told me that, for the first time, they were looking at the rough outlines of a viable Palestinian state. But the talks were irrelevant, drowned out by the violence raging on the streets of the West Bank and Gaza, where the second Palestinian uprising, or ""intifada"", had erupted the previous September. Once again, Israel was in the midst of a political transition. Prime Minister Ehud Barak had already resigned. Ariel Sharon comfortably defeated him a few weeks later. The map on the napkin, just like Olmert's map eight years later, showed what might have been."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9vynvzwyw4o,Huge crowds gather for Hezbollah leader Nasrallah's funeral,2025-02-23T16:44:46.940Z,Anna Lamche,"Large crowds have gathered for the funeral of Hezbollah's former leader Hassan Nasrallah, who was killed in an Israeli air strike in Beirut in September. Mourners dressed in black flocked to a stadium on the outskirts of the Lebanese capital on Sunday. They also paid their respects to Hashem Safieddine, Nasrallah's successor, who was killed in a separate Israeli strike before he could assume his post. Nasrallah, the former leader of the Lebanese militant Shia Islamist group, was one of the most influential figures in the Middle East. Hours before the funeral began at 13:00 local time (11:00 GMT), Israel launched air strikes in southern Lebanon targeting Hezbollah rocket launchers. People braved the cold to attend the funeral, which was held at the 50,000-capacity Camille Chamoun Sports City stadium. Nasrallah's coffin was draped in Hezbollah's flag and paraded along with Safieddine's casket through huge crowds of black-clad mourners. Excerpts of Nasrallah's speeches were played to the gathered supporters, who chanted, waved flags and held portraits of the leaders. Hezbollah's current leader, Naim Qassem, addressed mourners via video link from an undisclosed location, saying Hezbollah remained ""strong"" and ""would not submit"". One mourner, 55-year-old Umm Mahdi, told the AFP news agency that the funeral was the ""least we can do"" for Nasrallah, ""who gave up everything"" for his cause. Prior to his death, he had not been seen in public for years because of fears of being assassinated by Israel. The late leader had close personal links to Iran and played a key role in turning Hezbollah into the political and military force it is today. He was revered by the group's supporters. Under Nasrallah's 30-year leadership, Hezbollah - which is banned as a terrorist organisation in the UK, US and other countries - helped train fighters from the Palestinian armed group Hamas, as well as militias in Iraq and Yemen, and obtained missiles and rockets from Iran for use against Israel. He died aged 64 in Dahieh, a closely-guarded suburb of Beirut. After Nasrallah's death, Hezbollah allowed open access to the area for the first time for a public memorial. The mass funeral is an apparent show of strength for Hezbollah, which suffered a series of major setbacks during Israel's campaign in Lebanon last year. Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz wrote on X that Israeli planes were flying over the stadium while the funeral took place to ""convey a clear message: whoever threatens to destroy Israel - that will be the end of them"". Israel's incursion into Lebanon came after almost a year of cross-border hostilities sparked by the war in Gaza. Lebanon was subject to an intense Israeli air campaign and a ground invasion of the country's south. Dozens of senior figures were killed when Israeli-made walkie-talkies were detonated in a surprise attack in September 2024. Many of Hezbollah's most senior military and political leaders were also killed during the latest conflict with Israel. The offensive killed around 4,000 people in Lebanon - including many civilians - and led to more than 1.2 million residents being displaced before a ceasefire deal was struck in November. Representatives from Iran, Iraq and Yemen attended the funeral, which was delayed to allow time for the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon - though some troops still remain. Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi described the slain leaders as ""two heroes of the resistance"" in a speech."

Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz said the camps in Jenin, Tulkarm and Nur Shams were now ""empty"" and would be occupied by the Israeli military for the coming year. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said it has deployed a tank division around the city of Jenin - the first time it has done so since 2002. The Palestinian Authority condemned the move. The UN said earlier this month that Israel's operation, which began on 21 January and was intensified in recent days, had led to the ""forced displacement"" of 40,000 people. ""So far, 40,000 Palestinians have evacuated from the refugee camps of Jenin, Tulkarem, and Nur Shams, which are now empty of residents,"" Israel Katz said in a statement. ""I have instructed [troops] to prepare for a prolonged presence in the cleared camps for the coming year and to prevent the return of residents and the resurgence of terrorism."" He also said that Israel had instructed the UN's Palestinian refugee agency (Unrwa) to stop operating in the area. Nabil Abu Rudeineh, a spokesman for Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, described the decision to deploy tanks as a ""dangerous Israeli escalation that will not lead to stability or calm"". The IDF said in a statement that its forces are ""continuing the operation to thwart terrorism"" and are expanding their ""offensive activity"" - which so far has involved drones, tanks, special forces, border police, and operatives from the intelligence agency Shin Bet. The UN said on Thursday that since Israeli operations began on 21 January, 51 Palestinians, including seven children, have been killed in Jenin, Tulkarm and Tubas governorates, as well as three Israeli soldiers. The offensive has caused severe damage to water and sanitation infrastructure, disrupting access to water to ""tens of thousands of people"", it said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu visited Tulkarm refugee camp on Friday and ordered the army to intensify ""operational activity"", his office said. ""We are entering terrorist strongholds, flattening entire streets that terrorists use, and their homes. We are eliminating terrorists, commanders,"" Netanyahu said. His visit followed the explosion of three buses in Tel Aviv, which Israeli officials described as a ""suspected terror attack"" that was caused by bombs of the kind previously found in the West Bank. Israel occupied the West Bank in the 1967 Six Day War and has since built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8x4pxwne1yo,Gaza ceasefire once again in doubt as first phase nears end,2025-02-23T11:42:44.547Z,Sebastian Usher,"As the first phase of the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas in Gaza is meant to be drawing to an end, it has once again been put in doubt. After the last six living Israel hostages due to be released in this phase were freed, more than 600 Palestinian prisoners were due to be released by Israel in exchange - the biggest number so far to be freed in one go. But that has now been delayed indefinitely by the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, with his demand that Hamas must stop what he called its ""cynical use of hostages for propaganda purposes"". Hamas has in turn accused Israel of deliberately trying to disrupt the ceasefire agreement. It's the latest big bump in the road that's intended ultimately to lead to a permanent end to hostilities and the start of rebuilding Gaza. Israel complained about the chaotic scenes in one of the first handovers, saying the physical safety of the hostages had been put in jeopardy. Then, Israel said Hamas had broken the terms of the agreement by not releasing a female civilian hostage, Arbel Yehud. In response, it delayed opening access for hundreds of thousands of Palestinians to return to the north of Gaza for 48 hours. That was resolved when Arbel Yehud was freed in an extra handover before the next scheduled for the following Saturday. Hamas later accused Israel of not living up to its commitments to permit heavy machinery, tents and caravans into Gaza. It then said it would not carry out the next hostage handover as scheduled. That prompted threats from both Netanyahu and the US President Donald Trump that all out war would resume in Gaza if the hostages weren't freed as agreed. With the clock ticking down, Hamas agreed to release them. And just in the past few days, the discovery that the body Hamas handed over on Thursday as that of Shiri Bibas turned out not to be her. That set off new anger and shock in Israel, where the images of Shiri trying to shield her two young children as they were abducted on 7 October, 2023, is seen as the most potent symbol of the horror of that day. Netanyahu denounced Hamas for what he called a ""cruel and evil violation"" of the agreement. Once again, the ceasefire was kept on track only at the last moment by Hamas providing another body within a day that this time did indeed prove to be hers. All these incidents have shown how fragile the ceasefire process remains. They may also have contributed to the fact talks on the second phase - due to start earlier this month - have not yet got under way. Time is running out, with the first phase due to end in a week's time. Hamas has offered to release the remaining hostages due to be freed in the second phase in one go, but only if Israel pulls all its forces out of Gaza and there is a permanent end to the war. Israel has demanded the complete disarmament of Hamas, which it has so far rejected. The stage-managed ceremonies at each hostage handover, which Netanyahu has so strongly condemned, are intended to show it is still a force to be reckoned with in Gaza. In Israel, voices on the right demand the government resumes its war against Hamas, while the families of the hostages - backed by much of Israel - say securing the release of the remaining hostages is what matters above and beyond all else. Trump's plan for Gaza has brought new uncertainty into the equation. The third phase of the ceasefire is meant to set Gaza on the path towards reconstruction and renewal. Arab states are hurriedly trying to come up with a concrete alternative proposal in which Palestinians would continue to live in Gaza while it is rebuilt, rather than being removed from the enclave as envisaged in Trump's plan. The future governance of Gaza also remains a key sticking point, with Israel, Hamas, the Palestinian Authority and Arab countries all so far appearing to have contradictory proposals. These issues will require difficult negotiations, which will be conducted amid the constant risk of a return to war, for which some on both sides continue to advocate. But for now, the mediators from Egypt, Qatar and the US may have their work cut out just getting the first phase of the ceasefire over the line."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjry4nqw4z0o,Israel indefinitely delays Palestinian prisoner release as hostages freed,2025-02-23T10:04:45.216Z,Sebastian Usher Lucy Clarke-Billings,"Israel says it is indefinitely delaying the release of more than 600 Palestinian prisoners, in another potentially major setback in the ceasefire process. Benjamin Netanyahu said the release was now going to be delayed until the next handover of hostages by Hamas was guaranteed - and without what the Israeli prime minister called the degrading ceremonies Hamas has put on each week. Only one more handover - of the bodies of four hostages who died in captivity - is due to take place in the first phase of the ceasefire deal, which is due to end on 1 March. No arrangements for the release of other living hostages, due to take place in the second phase, have yet been made. Delegations from Israel and Hamas were due to negotiate the exact terms of the second phase while the first was ongoing - but have yet to meet. Mediators will be working overtime to get the deal back on track and avert a possible collapse, after both Israel and Hamas accused one another of breaking the terms of the agreement. Netanyahu accused Hamas of ""repeated violations"", including the ""cynical use of the hostages for propaganda purposes"". In response, Hamas official Izzat al-Rishq strongly condemned the decision to postpone the release of the prisoners in a statement on Sunday morning. He said that Israel's claim that the handover ceremonies were humiliating was a ""false claim and a flimsy argument"" aimed at evading its obligations under the ceasefire agreement. Netanyahu's statement came after four hostages taken captive on 7 October - Tal Shoham, Omer Shem Tov, Eliya Cohen and Omer Wenkert - were released on Saturday. The two other released hostages, Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, were held in Gaza for years - Mr Mengistu since 2014 and Mr al-Sayed since 2015. In exchange, Israel was supposed to release 602 Palestinian prisoners. Hamas accused Israel of violating the agreement by delaying the release. The six Israeli hostages are the final living hostages to be returned as part of the first phase of a ceasefire agreement. Meanwhile, outside the Ofer Prison in the occupied West Bank, family and friends waited for the release of Palestinian prisoners. According to Palestinian authorities, 50 prisoners who were going to be released were serving life sentences, 60 had long sentences, and 445 were detained by Israel since 7 October. There are 62 hostages taken on 7 October 2023 still being held by Hamas, about half of whom are believed to be alive. Hamas began releasing hostages, facilitated by the Red Cross, in exchange for Palestinian prisoners after the ceasefire agreement took effect on 19 January. Initial chaotic scenes have become more choreographed, with hostages flanked by fighters on stages before the handovers. On Saturday, Mr Shoham, 40, and Mr Mengistu, 39, were passed to the Red Cross in Rafah in southern Gaza before being transferred to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF). Mr Shoham was visiting family at Kibbutz Be'eri in October 2023 when he and others, including his wife and two children, were kidnapped by Hamas. His captured family members were released after 50 days. In a statement, his family said: ""This is an unforgettable moment, where all emotions are rapidly mixing together. Our Tal is with us."" Mr Mengistu, who is Ethiopian-Israeli, had been held by Hamas since September 2014 when he crossed into northern Gaza. He and Mr al-Sayed, a Bedouin Arab Israeli who entered Gaza in 2015, had both suffered with mental health problems in the past, according to their families. Mr al-Sayed's release was conducted privately in Gaza City on Saturday. ""After nearly a decade of fighting for Hisham's return, the long-awaited moment has arrived,"" his family said in a statement. ""During these days, we need privacy for Hisham and the entire family so we can begin to care for Hisham and ourselves."" Separately, at Nuseirat in central Gaza, Mr Shem Tov, 22, Mr Cohen, 27, and Mr Wenkert, 23, were freed in another public show by Hamas. All three were taken captive at the Nova music festival. Mr Shem Tov had initially escaped by car when Hamas fighters descended on the festival, but was captured when he went back to rescue his friends. Mr Cohen had hidden with girlfriend Ziv Abud in a shelter at the festival, but was found and driven away. The shelter was bombed, but Ms Abud survived and escaped. Mr Wenkert managed to send text messages to his family when festival-goers were being attacked, to tell them he was going to a safe shelter, but they lost contact with him. Crowds in Tel Aviv's Hostages Square greeted the public releases with cheers as they watched them unfold on a live feed. Families celebrating the return of the six men called for all remaining hostages to be released. ""Our only request is to seize this window of opportunity to secure a deal that will... return all hostages home,"" Mr Shoham's family said. Remaining hostages include Edan Alexander, a 21-year-old Israeli-American soldier captured on 7 October. His mother, Yael Alexander, who was watching Saturday's hostage release, told the BBC it was ""amazing"" to see them freed, but for her family it is ""very tough"" waiting. ""There are more than dozens of young men alive, like my son, still waiting to be released,"" she said. ""This is the main goal, to release the live people now from Gaza."" Saturday's joyful scenes contrasted with earlier this week, when the bodies of hostages Shiri Bibas, her two young sons and another captive Oded Lifschitz were returned to Israel. About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,319 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry."

Dr Chen Kugel, director of Israel's National Institute of Forensic Medicine, said an examination found ""no evidence of injuries caused by bombing"". On Friday, Israel said that the two children of Shiri Bibas - Ariel and Kfir - had been killed with ""bare hands"" and that evidence of this had been sent to Israel's partners around the world. The BBC has not seen or verified this evidence. Hamas has said the children and their mother were killed by Israeli bombing, without providing evidence. ""Our Shiri was murdered in captivity and has now returned home,"" the Bibas family said in a statement. The remains of Ariel, Kfir and another hostage, Oded Lifschitz, were handed over by Hamas on Thursday - alongside a fourth body which it said was that of Shiri Bibas. Israel's forensic testing then showed that these remains were in fact of a different unidentified woman. Hamas spokesman Ismail al-Thawabta said in a post on X on Friday that Shiri's remains seemed to have been mixed up with other bodies under rubble after the air strike. Hamas released the correct remains on Friday evening. The Bibas family said: ""For 16 months, we sought certainty, and now that we have it, there is no comfort in it, but we hope for the beginning of a closure."" Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari told a press conference ""forensic findings"", which have not been seen by the BBC, suggested Ariel and Kfir had been killed ""deliberately"". He said evidence had been shared with ""partners around the world so they can verify it"". Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas were aged 32, four and nine months respectively when they were kidnapped during the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023. They were taken hostage along with the children's father, Yarden Bibas, 34, who was released alive by Hamas on 1 February. Under the first phase of a ceasefire deal, which began on 19 January and lasts for 42 days, Hamas agreed to hand over 33 hostages in return for Israel freeing 1,900 Palestinian prisoners. On Saturday, the armed group released Eliya Cohen, 27, Omer Shem Tov, 22, Tal Shohan, 40, and 23-year-old Omer Wenkert - all of whom were taken during the 7 October attacks. Ethiopian-Israeli Avera Mengitsu, who was captured by Hamas in 2014, was also released. Hisham al-Sayed, a Bedouin Arab-Israeli held in Gaza since 2015, was handed over separately. Israel is due to free 602 Palestinian prisoners. In subsequent stages of the agreement, Hamas will release the remaining living hostages from Gaza and return the bodies of dead hostages. Israel has pledged to release more Palestinian prisoners. In the 7 October attacks, about 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. In response, Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas which has killed at least 48,319 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run Gaza health ministry."

Israel Defense Forces (IDF) spokesman Daniel Hagari said ""forensic findings"", which have not been seen by the BBC, suggested the boys had been killed with ""bare hands"". He said evidence had been shared with Israel's ""partners around the world so they can verify it"". Hamas has said the children and their mother were killed by Israeli bombing, without providing evidence. The bodies of the two boys were returned to Israel on Thursday, alongside the body of another hostage, Oded Lifschitz. Hamas said a fourth body handed over was that of the boys' mother, Shiri Bibas - but Israel said forensic testing showed it was not her. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu alleged Hamas ""put the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin"" instead of the body of Shiri Bibas. The IDF posted on X that ""during the identification process, it was determined that the additional body received is not that of Shiri Bibas, and no match was found for any other hostage. This is an anonymous, unidentified body."" ""This is a violation of utmost severity by the Hamas terrorist organisation, which is obligated under the agreement to return four deceased hostages.""  A Hamas spokesman, Ismail al-Thawabta, said on X on Friday that Shiri's remains seemed to have been mixed up with other bodies under the rubble of a structure after an Israeli air strike. The group told Reuters news agency they would investigate what had led to the wrong remains being sent to Israel. Israel demanded that Hamas return Shiri along with the other remaining hostages. ""Whether she is alive or not, they need to bring back Shiri Bibas,"" IDF international spokesperson Lt Col Nadav Shoshani told BBC Radio 4's Today Programme. Netanyahu said ""we will act with determination to bring Shiri home along with all our hostages - both living and dead - and ensure that Hamas pays the full price for this cruel and evil violation of the agreement"". In a statement, Hamas said it affirmed its ""seriousness and full commitment to all our obligations"" and had no interest in ""non-compliance"". Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas were aged 32, four and nine months when they were kidnapped during the Hamas attacks on Israel on 7 October 2023. They have become a symbol for many in Israel and the news that their bodies would be returned to Israel was met with an outpouring of grief. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said it was ""horrified and devastated"" that Shiri had not been returned, ""despite the agreement and our desperate hopes"". The children's father Yarden Bibas, 34, was released by Hamas on 1 February. Israel has confirmed that the fourth body returned on Thursday was that of veteran peace activist, Oded Lifschitz. The release of hostages' bodies was agreed as part of the ceasefire deal which came into effect on 19 January, and Israel has confirmed it expects eight bodies will be handed over. The two sides agreed to exchange 33 hostages for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners by the end of the first six weeks of the ceasefire. Talks on progressing to the next phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month, but have not yet begun. Twenty-eight hostages and more than 1,000 prisoners have so far been exchanged. Sixty-six hostages taken on 7 October are still being held in Gaza. Three other hostages, taken more than a decade ago, are also being held. About half of all the hostages still in Gaza are believed to be alive. About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023 and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,319 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Also on Thursday, three buses exploded in Bat Yam, south of Tel Aviv, in what Israeli police said is a suspected terror attack. Devices in two other buses failed to explode, they said. No casualties were reported. In response, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office announced he had ordered the IDF to carry out an ""intensive operation against centers of terrorism"" in the West Bank."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ce8mv5dp0r3o,'The smallest coffins are the heaviest': Israel grieves youngest hostages,2025-02-21T19:30:11.687Z,Lucy Manning,"Kfir and Ariel Bibas were last seen on 7 October with their mother Shiri's hands around them, holding onto her boys surrounded by gunmen and violence, trying to protect them. She couldn't. According to the Israeli army, Kfir and Ariel's last moments were at the ""bare hands"" of their captors. How do you eulogise children who have barely lived their lives? Kfir Bibas, a hostage at just nine months old, did not live to take his first steps or celebrate his first birthday. Ariel Bibas had only experienced four years of a life that should have been much longer. A statement from Kibbutz Nir Oz, where the boys were taken hostage from, described Kfir as ""a calm and smiley baby, with ginger hair and a laugh that would make anyone's heart melt. Wherever he went he lit it up with his smile and joy."" Ariel, they said, was ""a playful boy with ginger hair, curious eyes and a big smile. He loved superheroes, tractors and cars, and ran non-stop, climbing and exploring the world."" The two brothers became the greatest symbol of the hostage nightmare Israelis are enduring. Bringing home the Bibas family was a country's fervent hope. Throughout the last 16 months they have been remembered, prayed for, kept in the hearts of people, not just in Israel but by Jews and others across the world. Images were shared of the boys in their Batman costumes with Ariel's cape flying in the wind; of older brother Ariel hugging his baby brother Kfir when he was born; of Kfir giggling and gurgling as his father Yarden played with him. And then the image seared into the minds since Hamas's attack on 7 October: the boys clutching onto their mother Shiri Bibas, her face tormented in fear, as they were surrounded by gunmen and taken to Gaza. No one in Israel wanted this ending; where Kfir and Ariel returned, not to their innocent childhood, but with their tender years already over. And where their mother who protected them until the last moment has not even returned with them. In Israel, there is communal pain and grief. In a video statement, the Israeli Prime Minister said Ariel and Kfir Bibas and 84-year-old Oded Lifschitz, whose body was also returned on Thursday, were ""brutally murdered by Hamas savages."" Holding up a picture of the boys, Benjamin Netanyahu said: ""Today is a tragic day. It's a day of boundless sorrow, of indescribable pain. ""Their bodies return home to a nation in mourning. A nation that will never forget and never forgive the evil that cut down these beautiful souls…The Bibas children in particular became the symbol of who we are, and who we're fighting against."" Netanyahu said: ""Who kidnaps a little boy and a baby and murders them? Monsters. That's who."" Israel's President Isaac Herzog said in a statement: ""Agony. Pain. Our hearts — the hearts of an entire nation — lie in tatters."" He asked for forgiveness on behalf of the country for not protecting them and bringing them home. Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas were aged 32, four and nine months when they were kidnapped during the 7 October attacks. About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the attacks and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry. This week, in Israel and abroad, people across social media posted images of broken orange hearts to represent the boys with the striking ginger hair. On Thursday, as the vehicles with the bodies of the Bibas children and Oded Lifschitz crossed into Israel, people lining the streets with Israeli flags shouted out ""sorry"". In October 2023 just weeks after they were kidnapped, the aunt of the Bibas brothers spoke to the BBC. Ofri Bibas Levy described how Kfir had just started crawling and eating solid food. ""They are civilians and are not supposed to be there. The longer they are there the harder it's going to be to recover them and the less chance they're going to come out alive,"" she said. On Friday she wrote on Facebook: ""I'm sorry Luli [Ariel], I'm sorry Firfir [Kfir]. ""You did not deserve any of this. We will miss you forever. We are not giving up on your mum Shiri."" In a video statement she added: ""Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir were taken alive by a murderous terrorist organization, and it was Israel's responsibility and obligation to bring them back alive. ""There is no forgiveness for abandoning them on October 7 and no forgiveness for abandoning them in captivity. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, we did not receive an apology from you in this painful moment. For Ariel and Kfir's sake, and for Yarden's sake, we are not seeking revenge right now. We are asking for Shiri."" Yarden Bibas, who was only recently released as a hostage, must now bury his two young boys, with his wife Shiri still not returned by Hamas. In Israel they are quoting words that painfully resonate: ""The smallest coffins are the heaviest."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckgznx04kgko,Hamas failure to return body is new ceasefire setback,2025-02-21T17:56:04.416Z,Sebastian Usher,"Israel's announcement that a body returned from Gaza on Thursday was not that of Shiri Bibas, as Hamas had said, throws up another stumbling block in this ceasefire deal. It was thought the remains of Shiri, a mother of two, had been handed over along with those of her children. But the Israeli military said forensic testing could only confirm the bodies of Ariel and Kfir, who would have been aged five and two, and not those of their mother. Instead, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Hamas had ""put the body of a Gazan woman in a coffin"", with Ismail al-Thawabta, a spokesman for Hamas, suggesting Shiri's remains had been mixed up with other bodies under rubble after an Israeli air strike. In a separate statement, the group said it affirmed its ""seriousness and full commitment to all our obligations"" under the ceasefire - and that it had ""no interest in non-compliance"". It also said an investigation was under way, and called for the remains of the alleged Palestinian woman mistakenly handed over to Israel to be returned. The Bibas family were among 251 people taken hostage during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, along with Shiri's husband, Yarden, who was released earlier this month. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Ariel and Kfir, the youngest of the Israeli hostages, were aged four and nine months when they were kidnapped. Their mother was 32. Netanyahu has threatened that Hamas will pay the ""full price"" for failing to hand over Shiri's body, calling it a ""cruel and evil violation"" of their agreement. No measures have yet been announced beyond Netanyahu saying Israel will act ""with determination to bring Shiri home"". But a further claim from Israel that Ariel and Kfir had been ""murdered by terrorists in cold blood"" will further inflame feelings in Israel.  In November 2023, Hamas claimed the boys and Shiri had been killed in an IDF air strike. The BBC has not been able to independently verify this. On Friday, Israeli military spokesperson Daniel Hagari claimed forensic tests had revealed that Hamas killed Ariel and Kfir ""with their bare hands"". ""Afterwards, they committed horrific acts to cover up these atrocities,"" he said, without giving specifics about the alleged injuries. Hamas has not yet responded to these accusations. For Israeli politicians inside and outside Netanyahu's government who have been demanding a resumption of the war in Gaza, these claims will be seen as more evidence that Hamas must be utterly eradicated.  The ceasefire is entering a new period of uncertainty, with the first phase drawing to an end - while negotiations on the next stage have yet to begin in earnest.  The second phase - in which all the remaining hostages, alive or dead, are due to be released - has been seen from the start as potentially more challenging than the first one. Israel is demanding the complete disarmament of Hamas, while Hamas rejects the prospect of Israel continuing to maintain tight security control over Gaza.  Any major breakdown in the deal could see a return to fighting.  On the other side, though, is perhaps the majority of public opinion in Israel - that nothing should get in the way of all the remaining hostages being returned. In expressing his condemnation of the latest developments, Israel's President Isaac Herzog made clear that Israel must remember what he called its ""highest duty - to do everything in our power to bring every one of our kidnapped sisters and brothers home"". The Hostages and Missing Families Forum echoed this, saying ""every step"" must be taken with ""careful responsibility"" to ensure the safe return of all hostages. A fourth body was returned to Israel, from Gaza, on Thursday - that of 84-year-old peace activist Oded Lifschitz. Just like Ariel and Kfir Bibas, the Israeli military said Oded's remains had been confirmed by forensic testing."

Israel accused Hamas of violating the ceasefire after forensic testing revealed the body returned on Thursday was not Shiri. A Hamas spokesman said her remains seem to have been mixed up with other bodies under rubble after an Israeli air strike. The group said it was investigating and affirmed its ""full commitment to all our obligations"" in the ceasefire. The three other bodies given back to Israel on Thursday have been identified as Shiri's sons Ariel and Kfir, who would have been aged five and two, and peace activist Oded Lifschitz, 84, the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said. Hamas previously said the mother and her two children were killed in an Israeli air strike. However, Israel said on Thursday intelligence and forensics show the boys ""were brutally murdered by terrorists in captivity in November 2023"". Ms Bibas Levy, sister of Shiri's husband Yarden Bibas, who was released by Hamas on 1 February, said: ""We are still waiting for Shiri and fear for her fate."" The events of recent days ""emphasizes the urgent need to bring Shiri back to us, save the lives of the living hostages, and return all the fallen for burial"", she said, Her statement came after Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel would ""take revenge"". ""For Ariel and Kfir's sake, and for Yarden's sake, we are not seeking revenge right now,"" Ms Bibas Levy said. ""We are asking for Shiri."" Ms Bibas Levy said it was ""Israel's responsibility and obligation"" to bring her family members back alive after they were taken hostage during the Hamas attacks on 7 October 2023. ""There is no forgiveness for abandoning them on October 7, and no forgiveness for abandoning them in captivity,"" she said. In a statement earlier on Friday, Netanyahu said: ""Ariel, Kfir and Oded: I am so sorry we couldn't save you from the monsters who did this."" The ""devastating news"" that Shiri's body had not yet been returned has brought ""profound grief"" to the family, her sister-in-law said. To her deceased nephews, Ms Bibas Levy said: ""I'm sorry I cannot yet cry for you. We are waiting for Mommy Shiri."" Shiri, Ariel and Kfir Bibas were aged 32, four and nine months when they were kidnapped during the 7 October attacks.

It happened in an area where the buses were parked in the city of Bat Yam on Thursday night. There were no casualties. Devices on two other buses failed to explode, police said. Local media reported that one of these carried a message referring to ""revenge"" for a recent Israeli raid on a refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has ordered the Israeli military to carry out ""an intensive operation against centres of terrorism"" in the West Bank in response. Footage on social media showed at least one bus on fire, with a large plume of smoke rising above. Speaking shortly after the explosions, police spokesperson Aryeh Doron urged the public to be on alert for ""every suspected bag or object"". ""We may be lucky if indeed the terrorists set these timers to the wrong hour. But it's too early to determine,"" he said on Israel's Channel 12 TV. In a separate televised briefing, police commander Haim Sargarof said the devices used to set off the blasts were similar to those previously found in the West Bank, where Israel has been carrying out months of raids against militants, AFP news agency reported. According to local media, one of the unexploded mechanisms, weighing 5kg (11lbs), carried a message saying ""Revenge from Tulkarm"", an apparent reference to a recent Israeli military raid on a refugee camp in northern West Bank. Following the explosions, the Palestinian militant group Tulkarm Brigade released a statement that said ""Revenge for the martyrs will not be forgotten as long as the occupier sits on our land"", Israeli news site Haaretz reported. The statement did not claim responsibility for the attack. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) have been carrying out operations against Palestinian militant groups in the West Bank for months, especially focusing around Tulkarm and Jenin in the north. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed as Israeli forces have intensified their raids."

He was a man of peace, a campaigner for, and a friend of, Palestinians. He was dragged from his home by Palestinian gunmen on 7 October and killed in captivity after being taken to Gaza alive. The return of his body on Thursday was devastating news for Ms Lifschitz and her family, particularly her mother Yocheved who was also a hostage but returned alive and now will not be able to reunite with her husband of 63 years. After identifying Oded's body, the head of Israel's National Institute of Forensic Medicine said he had been killed in captivity more than a year ago. The Israeli Prime Minister's Office said he ""was murdered in captivity by the Islamic Jihad terrorist organization."" The BBC were with Sharone, a filmmaker and academic, at her home when the ceasefire was announced last month. She shed tears of joy and hope as at last she saw an opportunity where she would discover what had happened to her father. After more than a year of him being held hostage, she didn't know if he was alive or dead. Sharone Lifschitz admitted then that at his age the hopes for his survival were slim, but she also believed ""miracles can happen"". Ms Lifschitz has been an eloquent and dignified voice for the release of her father and the other hostages, and shed light on the trauma the hostage families have faced since their ordeal began. ""One way or another, we will know. We will know if he's still with us, if we can look after him. We will know who we are grieving for… My father didn't deserve this. But she recognised there were ""more graves to come."" And now, one will be for her father. Oded Lifshitz was a journalist and veteran campaigner for peace who drove sick Palestinians to hospitals in Israel for treatment. In his campaign for Palestinian rights he met Yasser Arafat, then head of the Palestine Liberation Organisation (PLO). He helped to found Kibbutz Nir Oz, where he lived and was taken hostage from. It was a place where he was well-known for the cacti that he grew, the piano he played and the grandchildren he adored. In a tribute, UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer said he was ""deeply saddened"" by Oded's death, and sent his ""heartfelt condolences"" to his family. ""When I met Sharone in Downing Street, she showed remarkable strength in the face of the most difficult circumstances,"" Sir Keir said. ""The news of her father's death is a tragedy. It is my hope that the peace he worked to see in the region through his charity work and activism will be achieved."" About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the 7 October attacks and 251 others, including Oded and Yocheved, taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry. As well as Oded, three other bodies were released by Hamas on Thursday - who Hamas said were Shiri Bibas, 33, and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir. But on Thursday night, Israel's military accused Hamas of handing over the body of an unidentified person instead of that of Ms Bibas. ""During the identification process, it was determined that the additional body received is not that of Shiri Bibas, and no match was found for any other hostage,"" the Israel Defense Forces said. Oded's wife Yocheved, who was freed as a hostage by Hamas in 2023, met then-Hamas leader Yahya Sinwar while held in the tunnels under Gaza - and told him he should be ashamed of himself. The British lawyers supporting the family said ""Yocheved must be the only person to have met Sinwar, Netanyahu and the Pope, and given them all a piece of her mind. That is the kind of extraordinary person she is."" On Wednesday, as she received a peace award for her campaigning for the hostages, she said: ""Oded was a great fighter for peace. He had very good relations with Palestinians and the thing that hurts the most is they betrayed him."" His family said they could now mourn for a husband, father, grandfather and great grandfather, but after ""503 agonising days of uncertainty"", they had ""hoped and prayed for a different outcome""."

Israel has confirmed only the identity of the fourth - Oded Lifschitz, 84, a veteran peace activist - after a forensic examination. President Herzog wrote ""there are no words"" in a post on social media platform X, asking the four for forgiveness ""for not bringing you home safely"". It is the first time Hamas has returned captives dead since the ceasefire began last month. Following Hamas's handover of the four bodies, thousands of Israelis gathered at Hostages Square in Tel Aviv and observed a minute's silence. Six living hostages are due to be freed on Saturday. The news that Shiri Bibas, 33, and her sons, who would now be aged five and two, were dead triggered an outpouring of grief across the country. Hamas claimed in November 2023 they had been killed in an Israeli air strike, without providing evidence. The Israeli government never confirmed the claim. Addressing Israelis in a video statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the country was ""united in unbearable grief. Every home in Israel bows its head today. ""We all rage over the monsters of Hamas,"" he said. A lawyer for Dr Sharone Lifschitz, the British-based daughter of Oded Lifschitz, said the day was ""one of immense sadness, and of failure"". Early on Thursday morning, in choreographed scenes reminiscent of recent handovers of living hostages, four black coffins were laid out on a stage decked with propaganda in Khan Younis in southern Gaza in front of crowds of spectators. One of the backdrops depicted a ghoulish image of Benjamin Netanyahu with fangs looming over a picture of the four hostages when they were alive. Another read: ""The Return of the War = The Return of your Prisoners in Coffins"". One of those present, Ikram Abu Salout, told the BBC she was against handing over the bodies. ""They didn't remove the rubble and we don't even know where our children and families are."" A Red Cross official appeared to sign documents at a table alongside armed Hamas fighters before the four coffins transferred to vehicles belonging to the humanitarian organisation. United Nations Human Rights Chief Volker Türk said the handover was ""abhorrent and cruel, and flies in the face of international law"". ""We urge that all returns are conducted in privacy, and with respect and care,"" he added. The International Committee of the Red Cross echoed his words, saying: ""These operations should be done privately out of the utmost respect for the deceased and for those left grieving."" After the handover, the bodies were transferred to Israeli forces in Gaza and brought to Israel. People - many with Israeli flags and yellow ones representing the hostages - lined the streets as a police convoy with the coffins passed by. The bodies have been taken to the Abu Kabir forensic institute in Jaffa, Israel, for post-mortems. The Bibas family, and Oded Lifschtiz and his wife, were among residents taken from kibbutz Nir Oz when hundreds of Hamas gunmen burst through the border with Israel and attacked communities, security forces sites and a music festival. About 1,200 people - mostly civilians - were killed in the attack and 251 others taken back to Gaza as hostages. Israel launched a massive military campaign against Hamas in response, which has killed at least 48,297 Palestinians - mainly civilians - according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Yarden Bibas, 35, was released on 1 February along with two other hostages as part of an exchange for 183 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Oded Lifschitz, a retired journalist, had been held by the armed Palestinian group Islamic Jihad. His wife Yocheved was freed by Hamas on 23 October 2023. The release of hostages' bodies was agreed as part of the ceasefire deal which came into effect on 19 January. Israel has confirmed there will be eight. The two sides agreed to exchange 33 hostages for about 1,900 prisoners by the end of the first six weeks of the ceasefire. Talks on progressing to the next phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month but have not yet begun. Twenty-eight hostages and more than 1,000 prisoners have so far been exchanged. Sixty-six hostages taken on 7 October are still being held in Gaza. Three other hostages, taken more than a decade ago, are also being held. About half of all the hostages still in Gaza are believed to be alive."

The broadcaster has been criticised for Gaza: How To Survive A War Zone, which centred on a 13-year-old boy who is the son of Hamas's deputy minister of agriculture. Hamas is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by the UK, Israel and others. The BBC said it had not been informed of the family connection in advance by the film's production company and has apologised ""for the omission of that detail"". The broadcaster has added a message to the start of the programme on its iPlayer streaming service, making clear the family link, and saying the production team had ""full editorial control"". Culture Secretary Lisa Nandy said she would discuss the matter with the BBC's director general and chairman, ""particularly around the way in which they sourced the people who were featured in the programme"". A number of prominent TV figures including actress Tracy-Ann Oberman, Strike producer Neil Blair, former BBC One controller Danny Cohen and producer Leo Pearlman have written to the BBC to call for an investigation. They said: ""Given the serious nature of these concerns, the BBC should immediately postpone any broadcast repeats of the programme, remove it from iPlayer and take down any social media clips of the programme until an independent investigation is carried out and its findings published with full transparency for licence-fee payers."" They raised concerns about the ""editorial standards of this programme and the BBC's compliance with the Ofcom Broadcasting Code, its own Editorial Guidelines and English law"", and asked the corporation to explain what had happened. ""If the BBC was aware that Abdullah Al-Yazouri was the son of a terrorist leader, why was this not disclosed to audiences during the programme?"" they asked. ""If the BBC was not aware that Abdullah Al-Yazouri is the son of a terrorist leader, what diligence checks were undertaken and why did they fail?"" The BBC has kept the programme on iPlayer and the new message at the start reads: ""The narrator of this film is 13 year old Abdullah. His father has worked as a deputy agriculture minister for the Hamas-run government in Gaza. ""The production team had full editorial control of filming with Abdullah."" In a statement, the BBC said: ""Since the transmission of our documentary on Gaza, the BBC has become aware of the family connections of the film's narrator, a child called Abdullah. ""We've promised our audiences the highest standards of transparency, so it is only right that as a result of this new information, we add some more detail to the film before its retransmission. We apologise for the omission of that detail from the original film."" It added: ""We followed all of our usual compliance procedures in the making of this film, but we had not been informed of this information by the independent producers when we complied and then broadcast the finished film. ""The film remains a powerful child's eye view of the devastating consequences of the war in Gaza which we believe is an invaluable testament to their experiences, and we must meet our commitment to transparency."" Nandy said the matter was ""a conversation I'll definitely be having with the BBC"". Speaking to LBC on Thursday, she said: ""I watched it last night. It's something that I will be discussing with them, particularly around the way in which they sourced the people who were featured in the programme. ""These things are difficult, and I do want to acknowledge that for the BBC, they take more care than most broadcasters in terms of the way that they try to portray these things. They've been attacked for being too pro-Gaza, they've been attacked for being anti-Gaza. But it is absolutely essential that we get this right."" The documentary, which aired on BBC Two on Monday, was made by Hoyo Films, which has not commented."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c93npgqlzvpo,Return of bodies marks day of anguish for Israel,2025-02-20T13:50:46.056Z,Paul Adams,"On a bleak late winter's day, under leaden skies and occasional driving rain, this was the moment all Israelis had been dreading. The return of the dead. It began, as all the handovers so far have begun, with a politically charged display by Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups involved in holding Israeli hostages for over 500 days. Once again, there was a stage, flanked by huge posters highlighting the catastrophic consequences of Israel's military campaign in Gaza and the Palestinian determination to stay put. But instead of haunted, sometimes emaciated, survivors, there were four black coffins, each bearing a photograph and a name – Oded Lifschitz, Shiri Bibas and her two young sons, Ariel and Kfir - accompanied by the image of Israel's Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu. Missile casings bore the slogan: ""They were killed by US bombs"". Hamas has long argued that all four were killed by Israeli air raids on Gaza, something which has not been verified. As previously, Red Cross officials were on hand to oversee the process. In a rare public statement on the matter, they had urged Hamas to conduct the handover in a private, dignified fashion. Their efforts had clearly been in vain, but they attempted to screen the coffins from public scrutiny, draping each one in a white sheet before driving them away. The watching crowd was smaller than usual, perhaps because of the heavy rain. After Thursday morning's handover, at a military ceremony on the edge of the Gaza Strip, the coffins carrying the hostages were draped with Israeli flags and prayers offered by the army's chief rabbi. A convoy of vehicles then made its way north towards the Abu Kabir forensic institute, in Jaffa, where formal identification of the bodies is taking place. Along the route, small groups of Israelis stood silently in the rain, carrying Israeli flags and yellow banners - the colour associated with the hostages and their supporters. In Karmei Gat, where displaced members of kibbutz Nir Oz are living, waiting to go home, the vigil was particularly sombre. All four of Thursday's released hostages were seized from Nir Oz on 7 October 2023. Tel Aviv's Hostages Square was a study in grief, with people crying or sitting on the ground, heads in hands. The faces of the red-headed Bibas boys - Ariel and Kfir - are plastered on walls, road signs and in windows up and down the country. Fearing the worst, Israelis have nevertheless clung to the hope that the brothers might have survived, along with their mother, Shiri. ""We were devastated by the news,"" Orly Marron said, outside Abu Kabir. ""I have red-headed grandchildren and seeing the photographs is really very heartbreaking."" Oded Lifschitz's son, Yizhar, meanwhile told Israel Radio that he had always feared for his father's health, since his violent abduction in October 2023. Oded was 84 years old at the time. He and his wife, Yocheved, were both taken to Khan Younis in Gaza, where they were separated, never to see each other again. Yocheved was released by Hamas two weeks after the attack. ""We need to close this wound and move forward,"" Yizhar said, adding that his father, a noted journalist and peace activist, had long had a vision about how to resolve the conflicts of the Middle East. ""It's sad that we went through this whole cycle and didn't solve it,"" Yizhar said. ""We left it as something simmering, and look where we are now."" Meanwhile, back in Gaza, some Palestinians expressed their anger that Israeli bodies had been handed over, while an unknown number of Palestinians killed in Israel's military campaign remain buried in the apocalyptic wreckage of the Gaza Strip. In addition, as many as 665 bodies are being held by Israel in numbered cemeteries, according to a Palestinian protest group, The National Campaign to Recover the Bodies of the Martyrs. It says some have been held for decades. ""I don't like this agreement at all,"" Ikram Abu Salout said in Khan Younis. ""They didn't remove the rubble and we don't even know where our children and families are."" As she was speaking, bulldozers flying Egyptian flags were finally arriving in northern Gaza. Israel allowed the equipment to enter, in exchange for Thursday's handover and the release of six more living hostages this coming Saturday."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cly48reeg55o,'I cried for days': Office raids and arrests shock aid workers in Yemen,2025-02-20T01:08:10.778Z,Sally Nabil,"When Hanaa arrived at work a few months ago, she found ""drawers and doors smashed, and the boss surrounded by security personnel"". Computers, phones, cameras and documents were all confiscated, her boss was arrested and the organisation's bank account was eventually frozen. Hanaa works for a US-funded non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Yemen, that supports women's empowerment and trains people to solve problems through negotiation. But the country's civil war, which has lasted more than a decade and created one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world, has made life for NGO workers increasingly dangerous. Twenty-four UN employees, along with workers from other local and international NGOs have been detained by Houthi rebels in the past few months. A wave of arrests in January has intensified the climate of fear - one person from the World Food Programme who was detained died in custody. The situation has left humanitarian workers feeling their freedom of movement has been greatly restricted. As a result, many organisations, including the UN, are scaling back operations, threatening to make life for people already devastated by war even worse. Ten years ago, Iranian-backed Houthi militants seized control of much of the west of Yemen, including the capital Sanaa, from the internationally-recognised government. Saudi Arabia, has since carried out intensive air raids on its neighbour - with logistical and intelligence support from the US and UK - to try to prevent the Houthi rebels from taking control of the whole country. It was Houthi officials who raided Hanaa's office and detained her boss, and she fears retribution if she speaks out. So, for their safety, we have changed the names of Hanaa and others in Yemen who we interviewed for this article. By cracking down on humanitarian workers, Hanaa believes the Houthis aim to spread fear among the public. But what hurts her deeply is how the public reacted. ""When I checked social media, it was appalling to find out that people see us as spies,"" she says. A day after her boss was detained, Hanaa was glued to her TV, watching a pro-Houthi channel airing what it described as confessions of espionage, made by nine local people who had once worked at the long-closed US embassy in Sanaa. They were arrested in 2021. That was the moment she feared things would get worse for her, as she worked for a US-funded NGO. She decided to leave her home in northern Yemen. By the time she reached the south, she felt traumatised. ""For three days I couldn't eat, I couldn't sleep. I couldn't stop crying,"" she says. Now she's worried that US President Donald Trump's decision to re-designate the Houthis as a terrorist organisation could lead them to target everyone who works in US-funded projects. Once someone is arrested, it can be hard for them to get any support, according to Yemeni lawyer Abdulaziz, who represents 14 detainees. They have been behind bars for several months - three are UN staff, while the others are employed by local NGOs. ""During the first three months of detention, my clients didn't communicate with anyone,"" he says. Abdulaziz is getting increasingly worried that their whereabouts is still unknown. More recently, he says that his clients were able to make a few brief phone calls to their families. ""Each call was between five to 10 minutes,"" he explains. The BBC approached the Houthis to ask about their treatment of aid workers, but got no reply. In addition to the detentions, lifesaving assistance from the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) has been paused as a result of President Trump's freeze on the organisation's operations around the world, amid allegations of waste and misuse of funds. Human Rights Watch (HRW) warns that that the impact of President Trump's policies and the Houthis' arbitrary arrests is ""nothing short of devastating"". It ""will have massive and dramatic impact on aid provision in Yemen"", says Niku Jafarnia, a Yemen and Bahrain researcher at the organisation. According to HRW, the US was funding about one third of humanitarian aid in Yemen, much of it through USAID. Between 2015 and 2021, it provided more than $3.6 billion, making it the largest single donor of humanitarian assistance in the country, according to the UN. ""Cutting aid would be a death sentence to us,"" warns Amal, a mother of nine. She lives in a camp for internally displaced people in northern Yemen, alongside thousands of other families. Even over the phone, it is clear what a heavy burden this woman is carrying. Her slow speech is laden with emotion. It is nearly 10 years since she lost her home. Amal singlehandedly supports her huge family. Her husband has acute asthma, so he can't work. The family had to flee their hometown further north after the conflict began. Since then, life has been increasingly unkind to them. The camp, on barren desert land, hardly resembles a home. Their only shelter is a worn-out plastic tent, with no chairs or beds. It is hard for her children to find joy in a place which lacks almost everything. ""If this supply line provided by NGOs is cut, my children might die. We have no jobs, no income, nothing,"" Amal adds.  About half of the population are in bad need of humanitarian assistance, including nearly 10 million children, according to the UN children's charity Unicef. The UN Human Development Index lists Yemen as one of the 10 least developed countries in the world. Amal tells us she receives a monthly food basket from the UN's World Food Programme (WFP), but it barely lasts two weeks. When they run out of food, she says her only option is to leave the camp and go out begging in the city's streets. She passes restaurants and shops, hoping for a few loaves of bread or a packet of rice. ""I am covered in shame, but should I leave my children to starve? I am totally helpless,"" Amal explains. Helplessness often takes its toll on her. ""I cry a lot when I realise that I don't have a penny,"" she says, her voice both anguished and bitter. A large number of children suffer from diarrhoea and pneumonia due to the poor hygiene, malnutrition and miserable living conditions, but adequate medication is rarely available. At a clinic in northern Yemen, the shelves where medicines should be lie empty. Staff told us the medical stock they have is nothing compared to the people's needs. The BBC contacted the UN seeking comment on the current aid distribution process and recent arrests but received no reply.  However, addressing the UN Security Council, Hans Grundberg, the UN Special envoy for Yemen, condemned the detention of its staff as ""not only a violation of fundamental human rights, but also a direct threat to the UN's ability to distribute aid to the most needy"". He also called for the immediate release of all detainees, whether from the UN or from other local and international NGOs. It is for families like Amal's that Hanaa and her co-workers try to make life better. She proudly remembers how they sent girls to school in one of the conservative northern areas. When parents complained about neighbours being able to see their daughters during break time, ""we held discussions between residents, and eventually agreed to cover the playground, so that girls could go back to class"", she explains. She fears that the absence of this support, due to fear and lack of funds, could increase rates of illiteracy. ""We are the only ones who have survived during the collapse of the state, in order to serve the people,"" Hanaa says with a sigh. The names of Hanaa, Abdulaziz and Amal were changed for this article."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdnp4ly5d1o,Hamas says it will return bodies of four hostages including Bibas family,2025-02-19T06:29:15.395Z,Gabriela Pomeroy,"Hamas says it will hand over the bodies of four hostages on Thursday, including the two youngest people held by the Palestinian armed group. The group's negotiator, Khalil al-Hayya, said the bodies would include those of the Bibas family - Shiri and her young children Kfir and Ariel, who were aged nine months and four years when Hamas kidnapped them during the 7 October 2023 attack. Hamas alleges that the three were killed in Israeli bombardment. Israel has not confirmed this. The children's father Yarden was released by Hamas earlier this month. Al-Hayya said Hamas would also release six living hostages on Saturday – double the number originally planned. In exchange, Israel will free all women and those under the age of 19 arrested since last October and is allowing some rubble-clearing equipment into Gaza through the border with Egypt. In a statement, al-Hayya said the group had agreed ""handing over four bodies of the occupation prisoners on Thursday 20 February, including the bodies of the Bibas family"". Hamas claimed in November 2023 they had been killed in an Israeli air strike, without providing evidence. Israeli officials have said only that they are gravely concerned for their lives. An Israeli official told Reuters that deceased hostages would undergo identification in Israel before being named. In a statement, the Bibas family said: ""In the past few hours, we have been in turmoil following Hamas spokesperson's announcement about the planned return of our Shiri, Ariel, and Kfir this Thursday as part of the hostages' remains release phase. ""We want to make it clear that while we are aware of these reports, we have not yet received any official confirmation regarding this matter. ""Until we receive definitive confirmation, our journey is not over. Hamas has named two of the six Israelis to be released on Saturday. They are Avera Mengistu and Hisham al-Sayed, who were seized in 2014 and 2015 respectively after they crossed into Gaza on their own. The Israeli government has said both suffered from mental health issues at the time. The families of several hostages have said that their loved ones are among those due to be released on the same day. They are Omer Shem Tov, 22, Eliya Cohen, 27 and Omer Wenkert, 23, who were taken from the Nova Festival on 7 October 2023, and 40-year-old Tal Shoam who was kidnapped from Kibbutz Be'eri. Under the first phase of the ceasefire agreement, Hamas agreed to release 33 hostages. In exchange, Israel agreed to release about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners. Talks on progressing to the second phase of the deal - under which the remaining living hostages would be released and the war would end permanently - were due to start earlier this month but have not yet begun. Hamas has said it is ready to release in one go all the hostages due to be freed in phase two of the ceasefire deal with Israel.  But a Hamas spokesman made clear that the offer involving more than 60 remaining hostages was dependent on a full withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza and an agreement for a permanent end to the war.  Hamas also rejected Israel's demand for its disarmament and removal from Gaza. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the talks would begin ""this week"". He said Israel would ""not accept the continued presence of Hamas or any other terrorist organisation in Gaza"" but that Israel could prolong the ceasefire if discussions were productive. ""If we will see there is a constructive dialogue with a possible horizon of getting to an agreement (then) we will make this time-frame work longer,"" Saar said. A total of 73 hostages are currently being held in Gaza - a mixture of Israeli soldiers and civilians both dead and alive. This also includes Thai and Nepalese nationals. Some 251 hostages were taken by Hamas when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people. Israel responded with a 15-month military offensive that killed 47,460 Palestinians, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, and devastated the coastal enclave."

Tuesday marked the end of the deadline for the Israeli withdrawal from the country, which was part of a truce that came into force in November and put an end to 13 months of conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant and political movement Hezbollah. The agreement, which was brokered by the US and France, also stipulated the removal of Hezbollah fighters and weapons from southern Lebanon and the deployment of Lebanese soldiers to the area where the group has been the dominant force for decades. But a day earlier, the Israeli military announced its forces would remain at five ""strategic"" hilltops, until the Lebanese army fully implemented its part of the deal. It was not clear how long they would stay. In response to the announcement, Lebanon said Israel must withdraw completely. It said it would consider ""the continued Israeli presence in any inch of Lebanese territory an occupation"". The truce agreement, which was brokered by the US and France, put an end to 13 months of conflict between Israel and the Lebanese militant and political movement Hezbollah. Early on Tuesday, Lebanese soldiers moved into the areas vacated by Israeli troops and began clearing roadblocks and checking for unexploded ordnance. Returning in convoys, residents carried the yellow Hezbollah flag and posters with the face of the group's late leader Hassan Nasrallah. In Kfar Kila, right next to the border with Israel, no building had not been destroyed or heavily damaged. Families searched the rubble for personal items, but few could have been saved. ""Our house is destroyed just like all the other houses,"" said 25-year-old Safaa Jouma, whose brother was a fighter killed in the war. ""We couldn't save anything. The house was levelled."" The ceasefire requires Israel to withdraw and for Lebanon's army to replace all armed groups south of the Litani River, about 30km (20 miles) north of Israel Israel's withdrawal had been postponed from the original 60-day deadline - which fell on 26 January - stipulated in the ceasefire. The positions where Israel Defense Forces (IDF) troops have been deployed are in mountainous terrain on the edge of the internationally recognised border between Lebanon and Israel. Israeli Foreign Minister Gideon Saar said the IDF was ""temporarily remaining in five strategic high points"", describing it as ""necessary for our security"". ""The IDF's enforcement activities against Hezbollah will continue at full strength. We will not allow a return to the reality of 7 October [2023],"" Saar said, referring to the date when Palestinian Hamas gunmen carried out an unprecedented attack on Israel from Gaza. Hezbollah had launched its military campaign against Israel the following day, saying it was acting in solidarity with the Palestinians. The group was heavily damaged in the conflict, the deadliest fought with Israel since the militant group was formed in 1982. Lebanese authorities say more than 3,960 people - many of them civilians - were killed during the hostilities, and one million others were displaced from areas where Hezbollah had a strong presence. Israeli authorities say more than 80 Israeli soldiers and 47 civilians were killed. About 60,000 citizens were displaced from northern Israel. Most of those displaced in Lebanon have returned home, the UN says, while only a minority of those displaced in Israel have done so, according to reports."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c743jle3vkno,Detained Britons charged with espionage in Iran,2025-02-18T17:08:17.550Z,Jessica Rawnsley,"Detained Britons Craig and Lindsay Foreman have been charged in Iran with espionage, the country's judiciary news agency has said. Mr and Mrs Foreman were arrested in the city of Kerman in January but news of their detention, on unspecified security charges, emerged last week. Judiciary spokesman Asghar Jahangir said that the couple, both aged 52, had ""entered Iran under the guise of tourists"" and ""gathered information in multiple provinces of the country"". The couple had been on a motorbike trip around the world and had planned to stay in Iran for five days before they were charged with espionage, or spying, by Iranian authorities. Mr and Mrs Foreman were heading for Australia on their journey across the globe and had crossed into Iran from Armenia on 30 December and were planning to be in Pakistan by 4 January. In a series of social media posts before they were detained, the couple - who moved from East Sussex to start a new life in Spain in 2019 - described their joy at being in Iran. Lindsay Foreman, a life coach with a doctorate in psychology, said she was ""having an amazing time"". Her husband Craig, who is a carpenter, spoke of the ""lovely people"" of a ""lovely country"". Announcing the charges, Mr Jahangir said that the couple had been under surveillance by provincial intelligence agencies and were ""subsequently arrested as part of a coordinated intelligence operation"". He added: ""These individuals were co-operating with front organisations linked to the intelligence services of hostile and Western countries under the pretence of research and investigative activities."" The chief justice of Kerman province, Hojatoleslam wal-Muslimeen Hamidi, said: ""According to intelligence and security agency monitoring, the connection of these individuals with several institutions affiliated with intelligence services has been confirmed, and further investigations are ongoing."" Alison Smith, a former neighbour of the couple, described them as ""just normal family people"". Ms Smith told the BBC she was a ""bit surprised"" by the couple's decision to travel to Iran, but said they probably ""thought they were going to be going on an adventure"". They had been on ""loads of adventures"" in the past, Ms Smith said. ""They went all over the place,"" she said, describing the pair as ""very sporty, very adventurous"". The couple had appeared on an episode of Channel 4's A New Life in the Sun in 2022 to showcase their lives as expats in the southern Spanish region of Andalucia. A spokesperson for the Foreign Office said ""we are deeply concerned by reports that two British nationals have been charged with espionage in Iran"", adding officials are continuing to raise the case ""directly"" with Iranian authorities. The Foreign Office is providing the detainees with consular assistance and supporting their family members, the spokesperson said. The Foreign Office's official advice is against all travel to Iran, saying British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at ""significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention"". Having a British passport or connections to the UK ""can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you"", it adds. In recent years, Iran has arrested dozens of Iranians with dual nationality or foreign permanent residency, mostly on spying and national security charges. At least 15 have had links to the UK. Human rights groups say they are often held as leverage, released only when Iran receives something in return. Richard Ratcliffe, whose wife Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was detained in Iran for six years, said Foreign Office travel advice would be ""clearer"" if it reflected the ""risks of hostage-taking"" in the country.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clye46n565xo,A glimpse at Picasso and Pollock masterpieces kept in Tehran vault,2025-02-17T02:35:33.795Z,Armen Nersessian,"It has been dubbed one of the world's rarest treasure troves of art but few people outside its host country know about it. For decades, masterpieces by the likes of Pablo Picasso, Vincent Van Gogh, Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock have been kept in the basement of a museum in Iran's capital Tehran, shrouded in mystery. According to estimates in 2018, the collection is worth as much as $3bn. Only a small portion of the work has been exhibited since the 1979 Iranian Revolution but in recent years, the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art has been showcasing some of its most captivating pieces. The Eye to Eye exhibition at the Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art, which opened in October 2024, was extended twice due to overwhelming public demand, running until January 2025. The display was widely regarded as one of the most significant exhibitions in the history of the museum, and it also became its most visited. The showcase featured more than 15 works unveiled for the first time, including a sculpture by Jean Dubuffet - marking its first-ever appearance in an Iranian exhibition. From abstract expressionism to pop art, the collection at the museum serves as a time capsule of pivotal artistic movements. Among the artwork is Warhol's portrait of Farah Pahlavi - Iran's last queen - a rare piece blending his pop art flair with Iranian cultural history. Elsewhere, Francis Bacon's work called Two Figures Lying on a Bed with Attendants shows figures appearing to spy on two naked men lying on a bed. On the opposite wall in the basement of the museum, a portrait of Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, the founder of the Islamic Republic of Iran, is on display in juxtaposition. The museum was built in 1977 under the patronage of Pahlavi, the exiled widow of the last Shah of Iran who was overthrown during the revolution. Pahlavi was a passionate art advocate and her cousin, architect Kamran Diba, designed the museum. It was established to introduce modern art to Iranians and to bridge Iran closer to the international art scene. The museum soon became home to a stunning array of works by luminaries including Picasso, Warhol and Salvador Dali, alongside pieces by leading Iranian modernists, and quickly established itself as a beacon of cultural exchange and artistic ambition. But then came the 1979 revolution. Iran became an Islamic republic as the monarchy was overthrown and clerics assumed political control under Ayatollah Khomeini. Many artworks were deemed inappropriate for public display because of nudity, religious sensitivities or political implications. Pierre-Auguste Renoir's Gabrielle with Open Blouse was deemed too scandalous. And Warhol's portrait of the former queen of Iran was too political. In fact, Pahlavi's portrait was vandalised and torn apart with a knife during the revolutionary turmoil. After the revolution, many of the artworks were locked away, collecting dust in a basement that became the stuff of art world legend. It was only in the late 1990s that the museum reclaimed its cultural significance during the reformist presidency of Mohammad Khatami. Suddenly the world remembered what it had been missing. Art lovers could not believe their eyes. Van Gogh, Dali, even Monet - all in Tehran. Some pieces were loaned to major exhibitions in Europe and the United States, briefly reconnecting the collection with the global art world. Hamid Keshmirshekan, an art historian based in London, has studied the collection and calls it ""one of the rarest treasure troves of modern art outside the West"". The collection includes Henry's Moore's Reclining Figure series - an iconic piece by one of Britain's most celebrated sculptors - and Jackson Pollock's Mural on Indian Red Ground, a vibrant example of the American's painting technique pulsing with energy and emotion. Picasso's The Painter and His Model - his largest canvas from 1927 - also features, a strong example of his abstract works from the post-cubism period. And there is Van Gogh's At Eternity's Gate - one of the very rare survivals of his first printmaking campaign during which he produced six lithographs in November 1882. But for art lovers in Britain, the collection is out of reach. The UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Iran and says British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention. Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for detention by the Iranian authorities, it says. Challenges remain for the museum which operates under a tight budget. Shifting political priorities mean that it often functions more as a cultural hub than a traditional museum. Yet it continues to be a remarkable institution - an unlikely guardian of modern art masterpieces in the heart of Tehran."

Craig and Lindsay Foreman were arrested in January, but news of their detention, on unspecified security charges, only emerged earlier this week. The couple, both aged 52, had been on a motorbike trip across the world and had only planned to be in Iran for five days. Mr Ratcliffe, whose wife was arrested in Iran in 2016 and not released until six years later, said the dangers of travelling to the country would be ""a lot clearer"" if Foreign Office travel advice reflected ""the risks of hostage-taking"" there. The UK Foreign Office advises against all travel to Iran, saying British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at ""significant risk of arrest, questioning or detention"". Having a British passport or connections to the UK ""can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you"", it adds. The Foreman family said the couple's detention was a ""distressing situation"" and they are ""deeply focused on ensuring their safety and wellbeing during this trying time"". Responding to the case, Mr Ratcliffe told the PA news agency: ""My heart goes out to them, and I hope they are not in for a long ordeal, and that the government is able to respond more promptly than it did in our case. ""I do think the risks would be a lot clearer to people if the UK travel advice to Iran talked about the risks of hostage-taking. People would be more alert to the fact that it is not personal, and it doesn't matter whether you have travelled there with a good heart."" Posting on Instagram before being detained, Mrs Foreman acknowledged travelling to Iran, against Foreign Office advice, and to Pakistan was risky and ""slightly scary"". But she wrote ""we know the rewards of meeting incredible people, hearing their stories, and seeing the breathtaking landscapes of these regions could far outweigh the fear"". Mr Ratcliffe said the ""top priority"" for the UK government should be ensuring Mr and Mrs Foreman were not being held in solitary confinement, because it was ""important they do not feel alone"". He added a court process in the case may happen soon but said: ""It's not a real court... it will be a form of brutal theatre to get the government's attention. And it will hurt much the same. I really hope they will be okay."" The UK Foreign Office did not respond directly to Mr Ratcliffe's comments when approached by BBC News, but said it was providing consular assistance to two British nationals detained in Iran and is in contact with the local authorities. Ms Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian national, was arrested at an airport in Tehran in April 2016 and accused of spying charges, which she denied. Mr Ratcliffe went on hunger strike twice as part of his campaign for his wife's release. She was ultimately freed and returned to Britain in March 2022 after the UK government agreed to settle a £400m debt dating back to the 1970s. Mr and Mrs Foreman were heading for Australia on their journey across the globe and had crossed into Iran from Armenia on 30 December. They planned to be in Pakistan by 4 January. After staying in the cities of Tabriz, Tehran and Isfahan, accompanied by a tour guide, they travelled on to Kerman, in east-central Iran, but never checked into their hotel there. The Iranian authorities have not said what the couple are accused of. In a series of social media posts before they were detained, the pair described their joy at being in Iran. Mrs Foreman, a life coach with a doctorate in psychology, said she was ""having an amazing time"". Her husband Craig, who is a carpenter, spoke of the ""lovely people"" of a ""lovely country"". The couple had moved from East Sussex to start a new life in Andalucia, Spain, in 2019 and appeared on an episode of Channel 4's A New Life in the Sun in 2022 to showcase their lives as expats. Mrs Foreman is reported to have been carrying out a research project on their journey to Australia, asking people what it means to be human and what constitutes a good life. She was due to present her findings at a conference on positive psychology in Brisbane in July."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw4egp7lwno,Iran's abandoned bases in Syria: Years of military expansion lie in ruins,2025-02-16T00:15:40.299Z,Nafiseh Kohnavard,"Mouldy half-finished food on bunk beds, discarded military uniforms and abandoned weapons - these are the remnants of an abrupt retreat from this base that once belonged to Iran and its affiliated groups in Syria. The scene tells a story of panic. The forces stationed here fled with little warning, leaving behind a decade-long presence that unravelled in mere weeks. Iran was Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's most critical ally for more than 10 years. It deployed military advisers, mobilised foreign militias, and invested heavily in Syria's war. Its elite Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) built deep networks of underground bases, supplying arms and training to thousands of fighters. For Iran, this was also part of its ""security belt"" against Israel. We are near Khan Shaykhun town in Idlib province. Before Assad's regime fell on 8 December, it was one of the key strategic locations for the IRGC and its allied groups. From the main road, the entrance is barely visible, hidden behind piles of sand and rocks. A watchtower on a hilltop, still painted in the colours of the Iranian flag, overlooks the base. A receipt notebook confirms the base's name: The Position of Martyr Zahedi - named after Mohammad Reza Zahedi, a top IRGC commander who was assassinated in an alleged Israeli airstrike on Iran's consulate in Syria on 1 April, 2024. The supplies recently ordered - we found receipts for chocolates, rice, cooking oil - suggest daily life continued here until the last moments. But now the base has new occupants - two armed Uyghur fighters from Hayaat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS), the Islamist militant group whose leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has become the new interim president of Syria. The Uyghurs arrived suddenly in a military vehicle, asking for our media accreditation. ""Iranians were here. They all fled,"" one of them says, speaking in his mother tongue, a dialect of Turkish. ""Whatever you see here is from them. Even these onions and the leftover foods."" Boxes full of fresh onions in the courtyard have now germinated. The base is a labyrinth of tunnels dug deep into white rocky hills. There are bunk beds in some rooms with no windows. The roof of one of the corridors is draped in fabric in the colours of the Iranian flag and there are a few Persian books on a rocky shelf. They left behind documents containing sensitive information. All in Persian, they have details of fighters' personal information, military personnel codes, home addresses, spouses' names and mobile phone numbers in Iran. From the names, it's clear that several fighters in this base were from the Afghan brigade that was formed by Iran to fight in Syria. Sources linked to Iran-backed groups told BBC Persian that the base houses mainly Afghan forces accompanied by Iranian ""military advisers"" and their Iranian commanders. Tehran's main justification for its military involvement in Syria was ""to fight against jihadi groups"" and to protect ""Shia holy shrines"" against radical Sunni militants. It created paramilitary groups of mainly Afghan, Pakistani and Iraqi fighters. Yet, when the final moment came, Iran was unprepared. Orders for retreat reached some bases at the very last moment. ""Developments happened so fast,"" a senior member of an Iran-backed Iraqi paramilitary group tells me. ""The order was to just take your backpack and leave."" Multiple sources close to the IRGC told the BBC that most of the forces had to flee to Iraq, and some were ordered to go to Lebanon or Russian bases to be evacuated from Syria by the Russians. An HTS fighter, Mohammad al Rabbat, had witnessed the group's advance from Idlib to Aleppo and Syria's capital Damascus. He says they thought their operation would take ""about a year"" and best, they'd ""capture Aleppo in three to six months"". But to their surprise, they entered Aleppo in a matter of days. The regime's rapid downfall was brought about by a chain of events after Hamas's 7 October attack on Israel. That attack led to an escalation of Israeli air strikes against the IRGC and Iran-backed groups in Syria and a war against another key Iranian ally – the Lebanese militant group Hezbollah, whose leader was killed in an air strike. This ""situation of psychological collapse"" for Iran and Hezbollah was central to their downfall, says 35-year-old fighter Rabbat. But the most crucial blow came from within: there was a rift between Assad and his Iran-linked allies, he says. ""There was a complete breakdown of trust and military co-operation between them. IRGC-linked groups were blaming Assad of betrayal and believing that he is giving up their locations to Israel."" As we pass through Khan Shaykhun, we come across a street painted in the colours of the Iranian flag. It leads to a school building that was being used as an Iranian headquarters. On the wall at the entrance of the toilets, slogans read: ""Down with Israel"" and ""Down with the USA"". It was evident that these headquarters were also evacuated at short notice. We found documents classified as ""highly sensitive"". Abdullah, 65, and his family are among the very few locals who stayed and lived here alongside the IRGC-led groups. He says this life was hard. His house is only a few metres away from the headquarters and in between, there are deep trenches with barbed wire. ""Movement at night was prohibited,"" he says. His neighbour's home was turned into a military post. ""They sat there with their guns pointing at the road, treating us all as suspects,"" he recalls. Most of the fighters didn't even speak Arabic, he says. ""They were Afghans, Iranians, Hezbollah. But we referred to them all as Iranians because Iran was controlling them."" Abdullah's wife Jourieh says she is happy that the ""Iranian militias"" have left, but still remembers the ""stressful"" moment before their withdrawal. She had thought they would be trapped in crossfire as Iran-backed groups were fortifying their positions and getting ready to fight, but then ""they just vanished in a few hours"". ""This was an occupation. Iranian occupation,"" says Abdo who, like others, has just returned here with his family after 10 years. His house had also become a military base. I observed this anger towards Iran and a softer attitude towards Russia in many conversations with Syrians. I asked Rabbat, the HTS fighter, why this was. ""Russians were dropping bombs from the sky and other than that, they were in their bases while Iranians and their militias were on the ground interacting. People were feeling their presence, and many weren't happy with it,"" he explained. This feeling is reflected in Syria's new rulers' policy towards Iran. The new authorities have put a ban on Iranian nationals, alongside Israelis, entering Syria. But there is no such ban against Russians. Iran's embassy, which was stormed by angry protesters after the fall of the regime, remains closed. The reaction of Iranian officials towards developments in Syria has been contradictory. While supreme leader Ali Khamenei called on ""Syrian youths"" to ""resist"" those who ""have brought instability"" to Syria, Iran's foreign ministry has taken a more balanced view. It says the country ""backs any government supported by the Syrian people"". In one of his first interviews, Syria's new leader Sharaa described their victory over Assad as an ""end of the Iranian project"". But he hasn't ruled out having a ""balanced"" relationship with Tehran. For the moment, though, Iran is not welcome in Syria. After years of expanding its military presence, everything Tehran built is now in ruins, both on the battlefield and, it seems, in the eyes of a large part of Syria's public. Back at the abandoned base, Iran's military expansion was still under way even in the last days. Next to the camp were more tunnels under construction, apparently the beginnings of a field hospital. The cement on the walls was still wet and the paint fresh. But left behind now is evidence of a brief fight - a few bullet shells and a military uniform covered with blood."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g7n3l98z6o,Israeli hostages and Palestinian inmates freed in latest ceasefire swap,2025-02-15T17:11:31.416Z,Henri Astier,"Hamas has released another three Israeli hostages in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners following a week in which the fragile ceasefire deal appeared under threat. American-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, Argentinian-Israeli Yair Horn, 46, and Russian-Israeli Alexander Troufanov, 29, were freed in return for 369 Palestinians held in Israeli jails. So far 19 hostages and more than 1,000 Palestinian prisoners have been freed in the first phase of ceasefire deal which began on 19 January. The swap came days after Hamas said it would pause the release of hostages, accusing Israel of violating the terms of the deal - an allegation denied by Israel. Israel, backed by US President Donald Trump, said ""intense"" fighting would resume unless the hostages were handed over. Hamas later said it remained committed to the ceasefire, and that Israel was ""responsible for any complications or delays"". But on Saturday the sixth swap went ahead, with the hostages handed over to Red Cross workers in a highly-choreographed public show in Khan Younis in the southern Gaza Strip. Surrounded by heavily armed Hamas militants, the men briefly addressed a crowd of Palestinians before being transferred into Red Cross vehicles. They did not look as gaunt as the hostages freed a week earlier - their appearance had aroused anger in Israel and elsewhere. Under the first six-week stage of the ceasefire deal, 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are supposed to be freed. The three men were airlifted by military helicopters to a hospital in central Israel, where they underwent medical tests and were reunited with relatives. Yair Horn and his brother Eitan, 37, had been abducted from a kibbutz during the 7 October 2023 attacks by Hamas. Eitan remains in captivity in Gaza. Pictures showed Yair Horn hugging his mother and his brother Amos in hospital, and a message where he wrote ""Eitan, you're next"". US citizen Sagui Dekel-Chen also reunited with his wife, where he learned that he had one-year-old daughter. His wife had been eight months pregnant with their third child when he was captured by Hamas in October 2023. US President Donald Trump marked the hostage release on Saturday, noting Hamas had not followed through with their threat. ""They seem to be in good shape,"" he said. Israeli President Isaac Herzog, posting on social media, said the hostages had been ""forced to endure"" a ""despicable and cynical ceremony"". In a social media post, Defence Minister Israel Katz said Israel would continue to work with the US to ""ensure that all hostages return to Israel soon"". The majority of the freed Palestinians were taken to Gaza, although some were taken to the West Bank. In both areas, crowds gathered to welcome the former prisoners. The Palestinian Red Crescent Society told the BBC that five of those released in the West Bank city of Ramallah were taken straight to hospital. ""They all have chronic illnesses,"" said Mohammad Faqih, an official from the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, adding that one man had a broken leg. Most of the 36 Palestinians serving life sentences will reportedly be deported to Egypt. The latest releases mean that under the ceasefire, Hamas is due to free another 14 hostages. However Israel says eight are of them are dead, meaning six living Israelis are still expected to be returned in the first phase. A total of 141 hostages have now been freed, including 81 Israelis and 24 foreign nationals released as part of a previous deal between Israel and Hamas. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 48,000 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry says."

""Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you."" Over the past few years, dozens of foreign and dual nationals have been arrested in Iran on vague security-related charges.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czdl6d0r2g5o,Senior UN peacekeeper injured in convoy attack in Lebanon,2025-02-15T07:36:17.503Z,Emily Atkinson,"The United Nations peacekeeping force in Lebanon says its outgoing deputy commander has been injured after one of its convoys was ""violently attacked"". The UN Interim Force in Lebanon (Unifil) said in a statement that the convoy was taking peacekeepers to Beirut airport when it was targeted and one of its vehicles set on fire. Protesters have been blocking the road to the airport following a decision by the Lebanese government to bar two Iranian planes from landing. Both Lebanon's President Joseph Aoun and the country's army condemned the attack on Unifil, and said they would work to arrest those involved. Several videos shared online show one white UN vehicle alight, as a group of young men, carrying yellow flags, chase and beat what appear to be peacekeepers as they attempt to flee. Separate footage shows a group of men shouting as they kick, hit and climb onto a convoy of three UN vehicles along a dark road. Unifil's injured deputy commander, who was not named, was returning home after ending his mission, according to a statement from the United Nations. ""We are shocked by this outrageous attack on peacekeepers who have been serving to restore security and stability to south Lebanon during a difficult time,"" it added. ""Attacks on peacekeepers are flagrant violations of international law and may amount to war crimes. We demand a full and immediate investigation by Lebanese authorities and for all perpetrators to be brought to justice."" Aoun said the attack was ""unacceptable"" and ""cannot be allowed to be repeated"". In a social media post from the presidency, he added: ""The security forces will not be lenient with any party that tries to destabilize and undermine civil peace in the country."" Supporters of the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah have gathered outside Beirut's airport since Thursday over a stand-off between Lebanon and Iran that saw two Iranian planes barred from landing in the Lebanese capital. It has left dozens of Lebanese nationals stranded in Iran. The measure was put in place after the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) claimed that Iran's Quds Force had been ""exploiting"" international flights to ""smuggle"" funds to arm Hezbollah. The IDF's Arabic spokesman Avichay Adraee said it was in contact with the committee monitoring the Israel-Hezbollah ceasefire, but alleged: ""Despite the efforts made, we estimate that some of these money smuggling attempts have succeeded."" The Amal movement, a group allied to Hezbollah, said ""the attack on Unifil is an attack on southern Lebanon"", and described it as ""a stab at civil peace"". Lebanese Interior Minister Ahmed Al-Hajjar told state media he would convene a security meeting on Saturday in light of the attack, calling it a ""crime against peacekeeping forces"". Unifil was created as a peace monitoring force in southern Lebanon in 1978. Its presence there was stepped up following Israel's war with Hezbollah in 2006."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm213pvdr22o,Hamas releases names of hostages due for release on Saturday,2025-02-15T07:13:24.470Z,Raffi Berg,"Hamas has released the names of three hostages due to be freed on Saturday in exchange for Palestinian prisoners in Israel, after days of fears over the future of the ceasefire. They are Russian-Israeli Alexander Troufanov, Argentine-Israeli Yair Horn, and US-Israeli Sagui Dekel-Chen. Israel has said it will resume bombing if the three are not released on time. The warning came after Hamas said it was postponing the releases in response to alleged Israeli violations of the ceasefire. President Trump said the ceasefire should be scrapped if Hamas did not release all the hostages held in Gaza by midday on Saturday. Since the ceasefire began on 19 January, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 766 prisoners. During the first six-week phase of the ceasefire, a total of 33 hostages should be freed in exchange for around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in Israel. The war was triggered by Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took 251 hostages. More than 48,230 people have been killed by the Israel offensive in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. There are 73 hostages taken on 7 October who are still being held in Gaza. There are also three other Israeli hostages - one of whom is dead - who have been held in Gaza for a decade or more. Alexander Troufanov, 29, Yair Horn, 46, and Sagui Dekel-Chen, 36, were all seized from Kibbutz Nir Oz on the edge of Gaza. The ceasefire has been under strain since it began, with each side taking reciprocal action over alleged violations. Intense efforts by mediators US, Egypt and Qatar have managed to stop it from collapsing. Israel has been especially infuriated by the staged way hostages have been released - publicly displayed on platforms alongside gunmen and in front of crowds of spectators, before being handed over to the Red Cross in chaotic scenes. For its part, Hamas has accused Israel of preventing what the group says are the amount of tents and aid lorries required to be let into Gaza under the terms of the ceasefire. Israel denies this. Meanwhile the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) published video of what it said was a rocket fired at Israel from Gaza on Thursday. It said the rocket failed and landed inside Gaza. A source in the Hamas-run police said the rocket was an unexploded Israeli ordinance that had fired into the air while it was being moved away, Reuters news agency reported. West Bank-based Palestinian news agency Wafa said a 14-year-old boy, Hammoudeh Alaa Saud, was killed the same day by what it said was Israeli ordnance which blew up in Gaza's Nuseirat refugee camp. "

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy4m3wx9w04o,Gaza plans put Egypt-US relations to tough test,2025-02-14T16:58:09.271Z,Yolande Knell in Jerusalem and Wael Hussein in Cairo,"In the bustling heart of Cairo, coffee shops teem with Gazans who managed to flee at the start of Israel's devastating war on Hamas. Although they have found safety, they remain worried about loved ones back home. In the past few days here, Egyptian intelligence officials have been meeting Hamas leaders to shore up the shaky ceasefire. Tens of millions of Egyptians - tuning into the constant news updates - already feel their country's intimate involvement in the war in Gaza. But now - with President Trump's surprise post-war vision, which proposes displacing two million Palestinians to ""a parcel of land"" in Egypt and Jordan, so that the US can take over the territory - they fear an existential threat. Egyptians flocking to Friday prayers say Trump's idea needs a reality check. ""We'd be moving the battlefront from their land into our own!"" says Abdo, a civil engineer. ""The Israeli army and the Palestinian resistance are eternal enemies and there is no peace between them. This would mean us giving Israel a pretext to attack them on our land in the name of self-defence."" Others stress how the idea of permanently displacing Gazans would be tantamount to the liquidation of the Palestinian quest for statehood. But, they say, it would also breed extremism and cause instability in Egypt. To try to convey a similar message, Egypt's President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi has launched a behind-the-scenes diplomatic blitz. He is facing one of the most challenging moments of his rule, which could reset relations with his country's key Western ally. Egypt is dangling the threat to its peace treaty with neighbouring Israel - long seen as a cornerstone of stability and US influence in the Middle East. Since Washington brokered the breakthrough 1979 deal, it has seen Cairo as a close ally. Egypt has consistently been one of the biggest recipients of US military aid, agreed as part of the treaty. Last year, it was allocated $1.3bn in military assistance. However, on Egypt's influential night-time talk shows, commentators have been voicing strong criticism. American military aid ""does not constitute any value to Egypt,"" Ahmed Mousa, a popular host on a private TV channel, recently said. He insisted Egyptians refuse ""pressure"" or ""blackmail"". Egypt's leader is choosing a different approach to Jordan's King Abdullah II, who recently met Trump at the White House. There, Abdullah adopted a placatory tone and promised to take in sick Gazan children, while not giving ground on the idea of resettlement for Gazans. Egyptian reports say that Sisi refuses to visit Washington while displacement is on the agenda, although the US maintains no trip has been scheduled. Egypt's own economy has been hard-hit by the Gaza war; it says it has lost $8bn in Suez Canal revenues due to attacks by Yemen's Houthis on ships in the Red Sea which began in response to Israel's Gaza offensive. The hope now is that by devising its own ""masterplan"" for Gaza reconstruction, Egypt can both avoid the hugely problematic mass displacement of Palestinians and boost its own economy. The Egyptian real estate tycoon, Hisham Talaat Moustafa - who is close to Sisi - has been on TV, pushing a $20bn (£16bn; 19bn euros) proposal for building 200,000 homes in Gaza in just three years, without Palestinians being moved away. The plan is feasible, says Professor Mustafa Kamel al-Sayyid of Cairo University: ""I don't think it will be impossible for the Egyptians to find safe areas for Palestinians to move there while their part of Gaza is being rebuilt."" Various ""innovative ideas"" are being put forward, he adds, including one for rubble to be used as a building material in reconstruction. Speaking ahead of a Middle East trip, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio acknowledged that Arab states ""don't like"" the Trump Gaza plan. ""Now, if someone has a better plan – and we hope they do,"" he went on, ""now's the time to present it."" Some Arab leaders are due to meet soon in Saudi Arabia, with Egypt calling for an Arab summit to discuss an alternative ""comprehensive vision"" for Gaza in Cairo on 27 February. Proposals are believed to involve a Gulf-led fund to help foot the hefty bill for reconstruction, and a deal to sideline Hamas. Israel and the US have made clear that the Palestinian armed group which has governed in Gaza since 2007 must have no future role. Egypt's idea involves training a new security force and identifying Palestinian technocrats - not affiliated to any political faction - who would be in charge of early recovery projects. However, coming up with a deal that satisfies Israel's hardline government will be challenging. The former US Secretary of State Antony Blinken envisaged world powers and the UN playing a temporary role in Gaza, until the Palestinian Authority (PA), which governs parts of the occupied West Bank, could take charge. But the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, sought to block the PA's involvement, as part of his opposition to Palestinian statehood. Egypt, along with other Arab states, remains committed to the long-time international formula for peace, the two-state solution which conceives an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Its foreign ministry has stated that it wants to work with President Trump to ""achieve a comprehensive and just peace in the region by reaching a just settlement of the Palestinian cause."" Back outside the mosque in Cairo, worshippers quietly point out how their country must try to avoid troubling repetitions of history. Already Egypt says it hosts more than 100,000 Gazans. With the idea of taking in many more, some worry their country could become a base for Hamas - an ideological offshoot of the country's own banned Muslim Brotherhood - which, they argue, could be reinforced, stirring up domestic turmoil. Ultimately there is strong support for Egypt taking a strong position and standing up to the US. ""Life is getting more difficult for us with the number of refugees we've already got. Imagine if we take in more!"" exclaimed a shop owner, who did not want to give his name. ""The Palestinians need to live on their own land not ours. We don't need anything from the USA. ""I stand by Sisi and the government and we're ready to face the full consequences."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67307858,What is Hezbollah and why has it been fighting Israel in Lebanon?,2025-02-14T15:27:30.000Z,,"Hezbollah is a Shia Muslim political and military group in Lebanon which has been involved in a series of violent conflicts with Israel. It has strong backing from Iran and opposes Israel's right to exist. The group is considered a terrorist organisation by Israel and many other nations, including the UK and US. The latest Hezbollah-Israel conflict erupted in October 2023, when Hezbollah began firing rockets over the frontier after the start of the Gaza war, in solidarity with its ally Hamas. Israel responded with strikes. The conflict escalated further in September 2024, when Israel said it wanted tens of thousands of people forced from their homes by Hezbollah rocket attacks to be able to safely return. It began a campaign of wide-ranging air strikes against Hezbollah, followed by a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. The conflict has left Hezbollah severely weakened. The offensive killed around 4,000 people in Lebanon, including many civilians. More than a million people have been displaced in Lebanon since 8 October 2023. Israel says 45 Israeli civilians and 75 soldiers were killed in the conflict to November 2024. A ceasefire agreement announced on 27 November requires both Hezbollah and Israeli forces to leave southern Lebanon. The initial deadline of 26 January was extended until 18 February. Hezbollah emerged out of Shia militias formed to resist Israel after its invasion of southern Lebanon in 1982, during Lebanon's 1975-1990 civil war. Its name means ""Party of God"" in Arabic. Officially announcing its existence in 1985, Hezbollah called for an Islamic government in Lebanon. It declared that its confrontation with Israel ""should only end when it has been removed from existence"". The group's attacks on Israeli forces are widely considered in Lebanon to have been instrumental in Israel's decision to end its 18-year-long occupation in 2000. The date Israeli forces left is a public holiday in Lebanon, called Resistance and Liberation Day. Afterwards, Hezbollah resisted pressure to disarm and maintained a significant military presence in the south of Lebanon. The group, and the Lebanese government, refused to accept the UN's finding that the Israeli withdrawal was complete, saying disputed border areas were still occupied. Sporadic exchanges of fire with Israeli forces continued. In July 2006, Hezbollah fighters launched a deadly cross-border attack, triggering a massive Israeli response. More than 1,125 Lebanese, most of them civilians, died during the 34-day war, as well as 119 Israeli soldiers and 45 civilians. The next month, the UN Security Council unanimously passed Resolution 1701, which ended the war and created a buffer zone between Israel and Lebanon. The current ceasefire deal also uses this agreement as its basis. It demanded that non-state armed groups in Lebanon disarm and pull back about 30km (19 miles) north of the Blue Line, the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel, in line with the Litani River. It said this area ""should be free of any armed personnel, assets and weapons other than those of the Lebanese authorities and UN peacekeepers"". However, Hezbollah, which had declared victory, did not comply and went on to build extensive infrastructure in the area. Lebanon says Israel's violations of the resolution have included military flights over its territory. Hezbollah also continued to upgrade and expand its arsenal. With Iranian funding, training and weapons, its forces became stronger than those of the Lebanese army. In 2009, the group issued a new political manifesto in which it dropped the reference to an Islamic government but rejected ""any compromise with Israel or recognising its legitimacy"". Its fighters also became battle-hardened in neighbouring Syria's civil war. By 2013, they were helping then-President Bashar al-Assad's government turn the tide against rebel and jihadist forces. Hezbollah has also been accused of carrying out a string of bombings and plots against Jewish and Israeli targets outside Lebanon. Many of Hezbollah's most senior military and political leaders were killed during the latest conflict with Israel. Hezbollah was led by Hassan Nasrallah, a Shia cleric, from 1992 until his death in an Israeli air strike in September 2024. Nasrallah had played a key role in turning Hezbollah into a political force, as well as a military one. He was revered by Hezbollah supporters and had close links with Iran and its Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Despite being one of the best known and most influential figures in the Middle East, Nasrallah had not been seen in public for many years, to avoid being targeted by Israel. Following his death, Hezbollah announced in late October that its deputy secretary general Naim Qassem would become its new leader. Other senior figures killed in Israeli attacks include cleric Hashem Safieddine, who had been expected to replace Nasrallah. Hezbollah's current military strength is difficult to assess as it has suffered heavy losses. Before the ceasefire was announced in November, much of its infrastructure was destroyed, its weapons arsenal was depleted and hundreds of fighters killed. The overthrow of Bashar al-Assad in Syria is also seen as a significant blow to Hezbollah. Syria, under Assad, played an important role in Hezbollah's connections to Iran and it was a key staging post for the transfer of weapons and ammunition to the group. Previously, Hezbollah had been considered one of the most heavily armed, non-state military forces in the world. In 2021, the group claimed to have 100,000 fighters, although independent estimates put the number between 20,000 and 50,000. Before the conflict with Israel escalated, it was estimated to have 120,000-200,000 rockets and missiles, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies think tank. Most of this arsenal was made up of small, unguided, surface-to-surface artillery rockets. It was also thought to have anti-aircraft and anti-ship missiles, as well as guided missiles capable of striking deep inside Israel. The war with Israel has also led to a political shift in Lebanon. A new president, Joseph Aoun, was appointed in January 2025, after the country spent more than two years without one. Aoun was the head of Lebanon's army and he was selected despite Hezbollah preferring another candidate. He has pledged to work to ensure that the Lebanese state has ""the exclusive right to bear arms"" - a direct reference to Hezbollah. In addition, a post-war cabinet named by the new prime minister, Nawaf Salam, excludes Hezbollah. However, it is split evenly among Lebanon's religious groups and Hezbollah's ally, Amal, was allowed to choose four ministers. New US Middle East envoy Morgan Ortagus has warned that the Trump administration has ""clear red lines"" that Hezbollah will not be tolerated as a part of the government. Before the war, Hezbollah - along with other political groups - was already constrained by Lebanon's many problems, including one of the world's worst economic crises and political corruption. No group ran the country and there had been no functioning government since elections in 2022. However, although the country was deeply divided over Hezbollah, it had considerable influence, with a seat in every previous cabinet formed since 2005 and a network of social services including schools and healthcare facilities. It also enjoyed substantial popular support from those who saw it as a resistance force against Israel. In a country where religious identity strongly impacts people's politics, many of Hezbollah's supporters have traditionally been Shia Muslims, while many of its critics and opponents are non-Shia."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdxnwnz1ldko,"Starved, threatened and abused: Parents of freed Hamas hostages give details of ordeal",2025-02-13T18:30:33.818Z,Alice Cuddy,"Parents of four young female Israeli hostages freed from Hamas captivity in Gaza have told the BBC about how their daughters were abused, including being starved, intimidated and threatened by armed men, and forced to cook and clean. They recounted how the hostages were held in underground tunnels and buildings, witnessed physical abuse and were made to participate in Hamas propaganda videos, including, in one case, by faking her own death. They said the women found strength through sharing stories, drawing and keeping a diary. None of the women have given interviews to the media since their release, and their parents say the full details of what they endured are still emerging. There are also things they can't speak about due to fears it could put the hostages still in Gaza at risk. Three of the four women whose parents spoke to the BBC were female soldiers kidnapped by Hamas from the Nahal Oz army base near Gaza on 7 October 2023. The hostages' access to food and their treatment by male guards varied over the 15 months they were held, their parents said. They were moved between locations, rarely seeing sunlight. ""It was very different between the places that she went - it could be a good tunnel, it could be a very bad tunnel. It could be a good house or a bad house,"" said the father of Agam Berger, 20, a soldier who had been at Nahal Oz. Some of the places had good food, some had ""very bad food... they just tried to survive,"" Shlomi Berger said. ""They [and their captors] had to run away from one place to another because they are in a war zone there. It was very dangerous to be there,"" said Orly Gilboa, whose daughter Daniella was also kidnapped from the base. When Daniella watched the release of three male hostages last week - who came out thin and emaciated - she told her mother: ""If I had been released two months ago I would have probably looked like them."" ""She got thinner, she lost a lot of her weight through the captivity. But in the last two months they were given a lot of food to gain weight,"" Ms Gilboa says. Other parents have also reported significant weight loss. Meirav Leshem Gonen's daughter was taken by Hamas from the Nova music festival. Romi, 24, was released in the first week of the ceasefire in January - she had lost ""20% of her body weight"", says her mother. Ms Gilboa says the hardest thing she endured was seeing a video that suggested her daughter had been killed. Her captors poured powder on her so she looked like she was covered in plaster, as if she was killed in an Israeli military strike. ""I think everyone who saw it believed it, but I just kept telling myself that it can't be,"" she told the BBC. The war was triggered by Hamas's unprecedented attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, when gunmen killed about 1,200 people and took another 251 hostage. More than 48,230 people have been killed in Gaza since, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. About two-thirds of Gaza's buildings have been destroyed or damaged, estimates the UN. So far, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been exchanged for more than 600 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel under the ceasefire deal that began on 19 January. Mr Berger says his daughter, Agam, was threatened by her captors and witnessed physical abuse while in captivity. ""Sometimes they tortured other female hostages in front of her eyes,"" he says, referring specifically to an assault on Amit Soussana, a former hostage who was released in November 2023. Mr Berger says his daughter told him how they were constantly watched over by armed men, ""playing all the time with their guns and their hand grenades"". He says the male captors treated the women with ""big disrespect"", including forcing them to clean and prepare food. ""That was really bothering her. She's a girl that if she has something to say, she'll say it. She's not shy. And sometimes she told them what she was thinking about them and their behaviour,"" he says. He adds that in a small act of resistance, Agam had refused to perform any jobs on the Sabbath, the Jewish day of rest. The men detaining her accepted this. They were also not allowed to speak loudly. ""When Agam came [back to Israel] she wanted to speak all the time... After a day, she had no voice because she'd spoken so much,"" Mr Berger says. Yoni Levy, whose daughter Naama, 20, was also taken from the army base, says she was sometimes held in locations where there was a TV or radio playing. Once, Naama saw her father talking on TV. ""It gave her a lot of hope and optimism... that nobody would forget her, and we'll do whatever is needed to take her out of this hell."" He says for Naama, the Hamas attack on the army base was ""much more traumatic than the captivity itself"". ""It may change but at this stage we think that this is the most tragic day that she's talked about,"" Mr Levy says. Footage of Naama that day shows her and other female soldiers in bloodstained clothing surrounded by armed men in a room at the base before being forced into a vehicle and taken to Gaza. The three female soldiers whose parents spoke to the BBC are among five from an all-women unarmed military unit at Nahal Oz freed in the first round of the ceasefire. Members of the unit, known in Hebrew as Tatzpitaniyot, are tasked with observing the Gaza border and looking for signs of anything suspicious. Survivors and relatives of some of those killed that day say that they had been warning for months that Hamas had been preparing for an attack. A few days before the 7 October attack, Daniella had been at home on a break from service. She had told her mother then: ""Mummy, when I go back to the army, there's going to be a war."" ""I didn't think it was going to be such a war and of course that my daughter would be taken hostage,"" Ms Gilboa says. Ms Gilboa and the families of the two other observers who spoke to the BBC say they are joining calls for an inquiry into what happened. They say their daughters remain concerned about the conditions of those still in Gaza and have called for the ceasefire to continue. Meanwhile, Ms Leshem Gonen says she is still learning what happened to her daughter Romi. She was shot at the Nova music festival and her mother says she was not properly treated, leaving her with ""an open wound where she could see the bone"". ""This is something we can know and that she speaks about. The other things, I think it will take time."" Ms Leshem Gonen says Romi described her release in the first week of the truce as ""intimidating"" and ""frightening"". She was surrounded by gunmen and crowds. But the moment of their reunion was ""so powerful"". The parents also described how their daughters had found ways to get through each day in captivity - through drawing, making notes or sharing stories with each other. ""They wrote as much as they could, every day - what was happening, where were they moving, who were the guards and things like that,"" says Mr Berger. While in captivity, the young women had dreamt about the things they wanted to do when they got home: getting a haircut and eating sushi. Daniella had drawn a butterfly with the word ""freedom"" while in captivity - she now has that tattooed on her arm. They are adapting to life back in Israel, and their families say they are taking the recovery step by step. The moment of reunion with his daughter Naama is still a blur, says Mr Levy, but he remembers the emotion. ""The feeling was that... I will take care of you now, and everything's going to be OK. Daddy's here. That's all. And then everything was quiet."" Additional reporting by Naomi Scherbel-Ball"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c3vpqr6511yo,Hamas says it will continue releasing Israeli hostages under Gaza deal,2025-02-13T17:28:43.330Z,David Gritten,"Hamas has said it is committed to implementing the Gaza ceasefire deal with Israel and will continue releasing hostages as scheduled, raising hopes that a resumption of the war can be averted. Following talks in Cairo, the Palestinian armed group said mediators from Egypt and Qatar had confirmed they would ""remove obstacles"". Egyptian and Qatari reports also said gaps had been bridged. An Israeli government spokesman did not comment on the reports but stated that if Hamas did not free three living hostages on Saturday then the ceasefire would end. Israel's prime minister made a similar ultimatum on Tuesday after Hamas said it was postponing releases over what it claimed were Israeli violations. Hamas said these included a failure to allow in the agreed amounts of vital humanitarian aid, including tents and shelters, which Israel denied. The group's threat to derail the deal prompted US President Donald Trump to propose Israel cancel the agreement altogether and ""let hell break out"" unless ""all of the hostages"" were returned by Saturday. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he welcomed Trump's demand and warned: ""If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon [10:00 GMT], the ceasefire will end and the [Israeli military] will resume intense fighting until the final defeat of Hamas."" However, there were conflicting messages from Israeli officials about whether he was demanding the release of all 76 hostages still in Gaza - in line with Trump's ultimatum - or just the three due to be freed this weekend. On Wednesday, an Egyptian security source told the BBC that Egypt and Qatar were ""intensifying their diplomatic efforts in an attempt to salvage the ceasefire agreement"", as Hamas's leader for Gaza, Khalil al-Hayya, arrived in Cairo to hold talks with Egypt's intelligence chief and other officials. After concluding the talks on Thursday morning, Hamas put out a statement saying they focused on the need for all terms of the deal to be fulfilled, particularly regarding deliveries of caravans, tents, heavy construction equipment, medical supplies and fuel. It added that the talks were ""positive"" and that the mediators had agreed to work to ""remove obstacles and close gaps"". ""Accordingly, Hamas reaffirms its commitment to implementing the agreement as signed, including the exchange of prisoners according to the specified timeline."" At the same time, Egyptian state-run Al Qahera TV reported that Egypt and Qatar had successfully ""overcome obstacles"" and that Israel and Hamas were committed to fully implementing the ceasefire deal. Qatar-based Al Jazeera TV also said the negotiations had been successful and that mobile homes and heavy machinery would be allowed into Gaza on Thursday. However, Israeli media then cited the Israeli prime minister's office as calling the Al Jazeera report ""fake news"" and saying there was ""no basis"" to it. Omer Dostri, a spokesman for the prime minister, later clarified the denial, writing on X: ""There is no entry of caravans or heavy equipment into the Gaza Strip, and there is no co-ordination for this."" When asked about Hamas's statement at a later media briefing, another Israeli government spokesman said Israel's position on the ceasefire agreement was ""crystal clear"". ""There is a framework in place for the release of our hostages,"" David Mencer said. ""That framework makes clear that three live hostages must be released by Hamas terrorists on Saturday."" ""If those three are not released, if Hamas does not return our hostages, by Saturday noon, the ceasefire will end."" War-weary Palestinians in Gaza said they had been alarmed by the prospect of a return to fighting after 16 months of devastating war. ""When the truce was announced, we felt immense joy. However, with the announcement of a new crisis, fear returned [and] traders began raising commodity prices,"" Mouti al-Qedra told BBC Arabic's Gaza Lifeline programme. ""I pray to God constantly for lasting peace, especially after the martyrdom of 65 members of the al-Qedra family. Now, we are relieved that the crisis has been resolved, hoping no more martyrs will fall."" The first phase of the ceasefire deal is supposed to last six weeks and see a total of 33 Israeli hostages exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza. So far, 16 living Israeli hostages have been freed since the ceasefire took effect on 19 January. Hamas has also handed over five Thai hostages outside the terms of the deal. The 17 other Israeli hostages due to be released during the first phase are two children, one woman, five men over the age of 50, and nine men under 50. They are supposed to be handed over in the next three weeks. Both sides have said eight of these hostages are dead, but only one has been named. Negotiations for the ceasefire's second phase - which should see the remaining 59 hostages released, a full Israeli withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire - have not yet begun. The deal has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians return to their homes in the north, and hundreds of aid lorries allowed into the territory each day. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 48,230 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5k6rk3gkno,Two British nationals detained in Iran,2025-02-13T16:54:13.223Z,Pia Harold Caroline Hawley,"Two British nationals - a man and a woman - have been arrested in Iran, the Foreign Office has confirmed. News of their arrest first came from state-run media in Iran which said they were in custody in the south-eastern city of Kerman, accused of unspecified security-related offences. It did not name them but published a photograph of them with their faces blurred, meeting the British ambassador, Hugo Shorter, at the prosecutor's office in Kerman on Wednesday. The Foreign Office currently advises against all travel to Iran, saying that British and British-Iranian dual nationals are at ""significant risk"" of arrest, questioning or detention. ""Having a British passport or connections to the UK can be reason enough for the Iranian authorities to detain you,"" the advice says. Also at the meeting between the Britons and the UK ambassador were Kerman's prosecutor Mehdi Bakhshi and the deputy governor general for security and law enforcement affairs Rahman Jalali, state news agency IRNA reported. Iran has arrested dozens of Iranians with dual nationality or foreign permanent residency in recent years, mostly on spying and national security charges. At least 15 have had links to the UK. Human rights groups say they are often held for leverage, released only when Iran gets something in return. In 2023, Iran executed British-Iranian dual national Alireza Akbari, who had been convicted of spying for the UK. He denied the charge and said he had been tortured and forced to confess on camera to crimes he did not commit. Later that year, environmentalist Morad Tahbaz, a UK-US-Iranian citizen, was among five people released as part of a prisoner swap deal between Iran and the US that also saw $6bn (£4.8bn) of frozen Iranian funds transferred from South Korea. British-Iranian citizens Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe and Anoosheh Ashoori were released in 2022 and allowed to leave Iran after the UK settled a long-standing £650m debt owed to Iran. "
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy8pzw3we2xo,"Israel seeks another extension for Lebanon withdrawal, source says",2025-02-12T20:25:13.722Z,Hugo Bachega,"Israel is seeking another extension of the deadline for the withdrawal of its troops from southern Lebanon, a Western diplomatic source says, a request that is likely to raise new concerns in a country with a history of Israeli occupation. Israeli forces had been due to pull out next week but the source told the BBC Israel wanted its military to stay in five positions there for another 10 days, till 28 February. The ceasefire deal that ended 14 months of conflict between Israel and Hezbollah was brokered by the US and France and came into force on 27 November. It requires the withdrawal of Israeli troops from southern Lebanon and the removal of Hezbollah fighters and weapons from there too. At the same time, thousands of Lebanese soldiers were expected to be deployed to the region where, for decades, Hezbollah has been the dominant force. The ceasefire has already been extended once - the initial deadline was 26 January - after Israel said the Lebanese state had not fully implemented the deal. Lebanon accused Israel of delaying its withdrawal. One of the priorities of the new Lebanese government is to restore the country's territorial sovereignty, and the authorities strongly reject another delay. President Joseph Aoun insisted on Wednesday that there was ""no truth"" to reports that another extension had been agreed, his office said. He also ""repeatedly stressed Lebanon's insistence on the complete withdrawal of Israeli troops"" by Tuesday. The continued presence of Israeli troops is a source of concern for many in Lebanon as Israel occupied the country's south for 18 years, between 1982 and 2000. Despite the ceasefire, Israel has continued to target Hezbollah, and has vowed to carry out more attacks on the Iran-backed group to stop it from rearming or rebuilding its forces. On Wednesday, Israeli warplanes broke the sound barrier at low altitude over the capital Beirut for the first time since the ceasefire began. Hezbollah, which is a militant, political and social movement, was severely weakened in the conflict with Israel, although it continues to enjoy significant support among Shia Muslims in Lebanon. The ceasefire deal was widely considered as a surrender by the group, after it saw its infrastructure and weapons arsenal depleted, and hundreds of fighters and key figures killed, including long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah. The conflict escalated last September, when Israel launched an intense air campaign across Lebanon, assassinated Hezbollah's senior leaders and invaded southern Lebanon. The offensive killed around 4,000 people in Lebanon - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents, Lebanese authorities say. It also caused billions of dollars in destruction and damage. Israel's stated goal in its war against Hezbollah was to allow the return of about 60,000 residents who had been displaced from communities in the country's north because of the group's rocket, mortar and drone attacks, and to remove its weapons and infrastructure from areas along the border. Hezbollah had launched its campaign the day after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c2eg01321zxo,'We are tired of war': Israelis and Gazans fear ceasefire collapse,2025-02-12T17:42:27.835Z,Gabriela Pomeroy & Maia Davies,"Israel has warned Hamas it will resume its military operations in Gaza if the Palestinian armed group ""does not return our hostages by Saturday,"" sparking fresh anxiety for people on both sides of the conflict. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's remarks came after Hamas said it would not free more hostages until further notice, claiming Israel had violated the terms of the three-week-old ceasefire deal. With the fragile agreement to end the fighting under growing strain, Israelis and Palestinians have shared their fears of its possible collapse with BBC News. On the streets of Khan Younis, Gaza's second largest city, 21-year-old Imad Qudaih said ""tension and fear"" dominate. ""No one wants war to return again,"" he said from the southern city, where conditions remain ""extremely difficult"". Imad said there was anger about Trump's proposal for Gazans to leave the strip, as well as fear of displacement - but he believed Trump's plan was ""not going to be achievable"" and ""is just words"". Displaced from eastern Gaza, Salman Mahmoud Abed said he ""hoped to God"" the ceasefire would continue. ""We are people who have been displaced and are homeless,"" he told the BBC. ""We lost our children, and our homes, and we are about to lose our mental health as well. ""There is no normal life, no proper food or any psychological relief. ""We ask Hamas and Israel not to resume the war, because we are tired of the war."" Ali Ismail Royshid - another Palestinian who has been displaced several times, most recently from Jabalia refugee camp - told the BBC: ""Enough with the tragedy, enough of the farce."" ""We want them to try to keep to the conditions, hold to the ceasefire and stop the war."" Even with the pause in fighting, they were still far from an end to the war, he said, adding: ""The war is still there, we are still homeless. ""How can we forget the war while we are still homeless living in tents?""  Abu Ahmed, who was displaced from northern Gaza, said he was scared neither of the war nor of Trump's statements. ""We are not scared of the war, because we have witnessed a lot, and whatever happens, so be it,"" he said. ""We are staying here and whatever God wants, will happen eventually."" Meanwhile in Israel, Liron Berman, whose twin 27-year-old brothers Gali and Ziv are being held hostage, has just found out that the pair are alive. ""To get the sign of life from my brothers is a lot for us, this is amazing,"" he told the BBC, his voice shaking with emotion. ""It lifts us up a little bit and we are fighting with urgency to get them out."" But he said their only chance was to keep the deal. ""My family's mission is to make sure the deal to release the hostages will remain. Only through releasing the hostages will the ceasefire stay in place,"" he says. Vicki Cohen - whose son Nimrod was taken hostage by Hamas on 7 October 2023 - spoke plainly about the situation. ""It is a matter of life and death,"" she said. ""They are in danger any minute."" She said the most recent release of hostages had sharpened fears. Last week, three male hostages were paraded in front of the cameras by Hamas gunmen during a stage-managed handover inside Gaza. The trio appeared gaunt and sunken-eyed. ""I am so afraid and so worried for my son,"" she said. In an appeal to Netanyahu to ensure the hostages' return, she said: ""Do the right thing... do what is good for the whole society."" Her concerns were echoed by Dudi Zalmanovich, another relative of one of the hostages still being held captive by Hamas. His 22-year-old nephew Omer Shem Tov was supposed to be among those due to be freed during the first phase of the ceasefire because he has a health condition. ""This news around the possibility that the deal will stop is really frightening us,"" Mr Zalmanovich said. Like Vicki, he said the ""very, very bad"" physical condition of the recently released hostages had heightened his anxiety. Now, Mr Zalmanovich said he feared ""any excuse"" could be used to collapse the deal. Additional reporting by Michael Shuval and BBC Arabic."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c203lwx4vg4o,Israel says Gaza ceasefire will end if Hamas does not free hostages by Saturday,2025-02-12T07:44:50.829Z,David Gritten Yolande Knell,"There is growing concern that fighting could resume in Gaza after Israel's prime minister warned Hamas it would end the ceasefire if the Palestinian armed group ""does not return our hostages by Saturday"". Benjamin Netanyahu's security cabinet met on Tuesday after Hamas said it was postponing freeing more hostages until further notice, claiming Israel had violated the terms of the three-week-old ceasefire deal. It remains unclear whether Netanyahu is demanding the release of all 76 remaining hostages, or just the three due to be freed this Saturday. Hamas responded by saying it remained committed to the ceasefire deal and that Israel was ""responsible for any complications or delays"". The group has demanded mediators address its list of complaints against Israel, including blocking vital humanitarian aid such as tents - a claim Israel has denied. It is understood Arab countries are exerting pressure on Hamas to try to get the deal back on track. Egypt has said it plans to present a ""comprehensive vision"" for the reconstruction of Gaza that does not involve displacing the population, unlike a proposal put forward by US President Donald Trump. Hamas's decision to delay this weekend's scheduled release had prompted Trump to propose Israel cancel the agreement altogether and ""let hell break out"" unless ""all of the hostages"" were returned by Saturday. Following a four-hour meeting of Israel's security cabinet on Tuesday, Netanyahu said in a video statement that he ""welcomed President Trump's demand"". He added: ""In light of Hamas's announcement regarding its decision to violate the agreement and not release our hostages, last night I instructed the IDF [Israel Defense Forces] to amass forces inside - and surrounding - the Gaza Strip. ""This action is being carried out at this hour and will be completed very soon."" He then issued an ultimatum that he said had the security cabinet's unanimous approval. ""If Hamas does not return our hostages by Saturday noon [10:00 GMT], the ceasefire will end, and the IDF will resume intense fighting until the final defeat of Hamas."" There were conflicting messages from Israeli officials about whether Netanyahu meant Hamas should release all the remaining hostages or not. One source told the Israeli newspaper Haaretz it would be willing to continue the ceasefire if the next group of three hostages were freed as planned on Saturday. There were then reports that it was a demand to free the nine living hostages remaining from the first phase of the deal. But later, transport minister and war cabinet member Miri Regev wrote on X: ""We made a very clear decision: we adhere to US President Donald Trump's statement regarding the release of the hostages - on Saturday, everyone will be released!"" The IDF meanwhile said it had raised the level of readiness of its Southern Command - which is responsible for operations in Gaza - and that it would be reinforced with additional troops, including reservists. Some Israeli analysts suggest Israel is trying to do a complicated manoeuvre: showing loyalty to the White House and not collapsing the deal. They say it is still possible Israel and Hamas can reach a compromise through mediators on this weekend's scheduled round of hostage releases. Hamas also reiterated on Tuesday its rejection of Trump's controversial plan for the US to take over post-war Gaza and permanently relocate the two million Palestinians living there so that it could be rebuilt and turned into the ""Riviera of the Middle East"". Palestinians fear a repeat of the Nakba, or ""catastrophe"", when hundreds of thousands fled or were driven from their homes before and during the war that followed the creation of the State of Israel in 1948. Many of those refugees ended up in Gaza, where they and their descendants make up three quarters of the population. Another 900,000 registered refugees live in the occupied West Bank, while 3.4 million others live in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, according to the UN. Hamas said Trump's remarks were ""racist and constitute a call for ethnic cleansing, aimed at liquidating the Palestinian cause and denying our people's inalienable national rights"". The Palestinian Authority and Arab states have also categorically rejected the plan, while the UN warned that any forced displacement would be prohibited under international law and ""tantamount to ethnic cleansing"". Netanyahu has praised the president's ""revolutionary vision"" for Gaza. Earlier on Tuesday, senior Hamas official Basem Naim told the BBC that the door was open for US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators to intervene and get the ceasefire deal back on track. ""We don't wish that this deal will fall apart,"" he said. ""We are doing the maximum to avoid any obstacles, any challenges, and therefore we are ready to hand over prisoners next Saturday if the situation is rectified through the mediators."" He accused Israel of ""continuous violations"" of the ceasefire deal, including delaying the return of displaced Palestinians to areas in northern Gaza by between 48 and 72 hours and obstructing deliveries of urgently needed food, medical and shelter supplies. The first phase of the ceasefire deal is supposed to last six weeks and see a total of 33 Israeli hostages exchanged for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza. So far, 16 living hostages have been freed since the ceasefire took effect on 19 January. Hamas has also handed over five Thai hostages outside the terms of the deal. The 17 other Israeli hostages due to be released during the first phase are two children, one woman, five men over the age of 50, and nine men under 50. They are supposed to be handed over in the next three weeks. Both sides have said eight of these hostages are dead, but only one has been named. Negotiations for the ceasefire deal's second phase - which will see the 43 remaining hostages still in captivity released, a full Israeli troop withdrawal and a permanent ceasefire - have not yet begun. The deal has also seen Israeli forces withdraw from densely populated areas of Gaza, hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians return to their homes in the north, and hundreds of aid lorries allowed into the territory each day. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 48,210 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times, almost 70% of buildings are estimated to be damaged or destroyed, the healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed, and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4z32y12jpo,Why does Trump want to take over Gaza and could he do it?,2025-02-11T18:17:55.204Z,Paul Adams,"Donald Trump has shocked the world by suggesting that the US could ""take over"" and ""own"" Gaza, resettling its population in the process. The proposal could mark the biggest shift in US policy on the Middle East in decades and upend the international consensus on a Palestinian state comprising Gaza and the occupied West Bank. Trump has suggested that under his plan, Gaza would be handed over to the US by Israel and its residents encouraged to move elsewhere with no right of return. The proposal has drawn condemnation, including from across the Middle East, close US allies and the United Nations. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, meanwhile, welcomed the ""revolutionary vision"" for Gaza. If Donald Trump is right about one thing, it is that decades of US diplomacy on Israel and the Palestinians have failed to resolve the conflict. Peace proposals and presidents have come and gone but the problems have festered. Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the war in Gaza it triggered were the hideous results. Trump made his millions as a property developer and, with that hat on, made a perfectly valid observation: if Gaza is to be rebuilt, from scratch in some places, it makes little sense for hundreds of thousands of civilians to be sheltering in the rubble. The task of rebuilding Gaza will be monumental. Unexploded munitions and mountains of debris have to be removed. Water and power lines have to be repaired. Schools, hospitals and shops need to be rebuilt. Trump's Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff has said that could take years - and while that goes on, the Palestinians will need to go elsewhere. However, rather than exploring ways of keeping them close to home, almost certainly in camps in the central and southern parts of the Gaza Strip, Trump has insisted they should be encouraged to leave - permanently. Despite fierce pushback from regional leaders, Trump has pressured Jordan and Egypt to accept Gaza's 2.2 million residents - threatening to withhold aid if they refuse. Both nations have rejected the idea, warning it could destabilise the region. Trump has said that Palestinians would have no right to return to Gaza under his plan. Instead, he suggested building up to six ""safe communities"" outside Gaza, saying: ""Could be five, six, could be two. But we'll build safe communities, a little bit away from where they are, where all of this danger is."" Trump believes that in the absence of Gaza's residents, an idyllic, American-owned ""Riviera of the Middle East"" will rise from the ashes, providing thousands of jobs, investment opportunities, and, ultimately, a place for ""the world's people to live."" Where to begin? Even for a president who spent much of his first term upending US Middle East policy – including moving the US embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem and recognising Israeli sovereignty over the occupied Golan Heights – this was an astonishing proposal. In their wildest imaginations, no US president ever thought that solving the Israel-Palestinian conflict would involve taking over a chunk of Palestinian territory and evicting its population. To be clear, to do this by force would be a grave violation of international law. Some Palestinians would likely choose to leave Gaza and rebuild their lives elsewhere. Since October 2023, as many as 150,000 already have. But others cannot or will not, either because they lack the financial means to do so or because their attachment to Gaza – part of the land they call Palestine – is simply too strong. Many Gazans are descendants of people who fled or were driven from their homes in 1948 during the creation of the state of Israel - a period Palestinians call the Nakba, the Arabic word for catastrophe. The thought of another will be too painful for many and they will cling to their reduced lives in what remains of Gaza with a fierce determination. For Palestinians who dream of a state of their own, alongside Israel, the loss of part of it will feel like an amputation. Gaza has been physically separated from the West Bank since 1948. Previous rounds of negotiations, as well as Trump's 2020 ""Vision for Peace"", included plans for tunnels or railways that might link the two. Now Trump is basically telling the Palestinians to give up on Gaza once and for all. Arab leaders have accused him of attempting to erase Palestinian claims to Gaza entirely. While he does not appear to be advocating the forced deportation of civilians - which is against international law - Trump is clearly encouraging Palestinians to leave. Palestinian officials have already accused Israel of blocking the supply of tens of thousands of caravans which could help Gazans to stay put in less damaged parts of the territory while reconstruction takes place elsewhere. The Arab countries that Trump says should accept as many as 1.8 million Gazan refugees, mainly Egypt and Jordan, have expressed outrage. Both have enough problems of their own without this added burden. On Monday, Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty reaffirmed Cairo's refusal to accept any forced displacement, saying Egypt ""will not participate in an injustice against the Palestinians"". Gaza was occupied by Egypt for 19 years before it was seized by Israel in the 1967 Six Day War. It is still considered occupied by Israel under international law, which Israel disputes. It says the occupation ended in 2005, when it unilaterally dismantled Jewish settlements and pulled out its military. Around three quarters of UN members recognise Gaza as part of a sovereign state of Palestine, though the US does not. Cut off from the outside world by fences and an Israeli maritime blockade, it has never felt like a truly independent place. Nothing and no one moves in or out without Israel's permission, and an international airport - opened amid much fanfare in 1998 - was destroyed by Israel in 2001 during the second Palestinian uprising. Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza, citing security reasons, after Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and ejected its rivals from the territory after intense fighting the following year. Long before the latest war, Palestinians had come to regard Gaza as an open prison. It goes without saying that the US has no legal claim to the territory and it is not at all clear how Trump intends to impose American rule. As with his bullish claims about US control over Greenland or the Panama Canal, it is not yet clear whether Trump really means it or if the comments represent an opening, outlandish bargaining position ahead of a bruising set of negotiations on Gaza's future. Various plans have been discussed for the post-war governance of Gaza. In December, the two main Palestinian factions, Hamas and Fatah, agreed to form a joint committee to oversee its administration - an agreement which has so far come to nothing. At other times, discussions have focused on the creation of an international peacekeeping force, possibly made up of troops from Arab countries. Last month, Reuters reported that the UAE, US and Israel had discussed the formation of a temporary administration in Gaza until a reformed Palestinian Authority (PA), which already has control in parts of the West Bank, was ready to take over. However, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has previously publicly insisted that the PA will have no role to play in running post-war Gaza. In a limited sense, American boots are already on the ground. A US security firm has employed around 100 former US special forces to man a vital checkpoint south of Gaza City and screen the vehicles of Palestinians returning to the north for weapons. Egyptian security personnel have also been seen at the same checkpoint. These could be the first, tentative signs of an expanded international - and possibly US-led - presence in Gaza. But that is hardly a US takeover, something that would require a large-scale military intervention in the Middle East. That is the sort of thing Trump has long told voters he wants to avoid - and both the president and the White House later said they believe the proposal could be achieved without US soldiers being deployed to Gaza. Negotiations on phase two of the two-week-old ceasefire between Israel and Hamas have barely begun but it is hard to see how Trump's bombshell remarks will help to advance them. If Hamas feels the end product of this whole process is a depopulated Gaza - devoid not just of Hamas, but of all Palestinians - it may conclude there is nothing to talk about and hold on to the remaining hostages it took on 7 October 2023. Hamas said on Monday that it would delay the release of the next group of hostages due to be freed over claims Israel had violated the terms of the ceasefire deal. Netanyahu, in turn, said Israel would end the ceasefire and send troops back into Gaza if Hamas does not release the hostages. Netanyahu's critics have accused him of looking for excuses to blow up the negotiations and resume the war. They are bound to conclude that, with these comments, Trump is a willing accomplice. On the other hand, the Israeli prime minister's right-wing backers have expressed satisfaction with the US takeover plan, potentially reducing the risk of cabinet resignations and making Netanyahu's immediate political future appear more assured. In that sense, Trump has given Netanyahu a powerful incentive to keep the ceasefire going. Asked whether he agreed the US should recognise Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, Trump said he had yet to take a position but that he would have an announcement to make in four weeks' time. That remark has caused alarm among Palestinians, for whom such an announcement would inevitably be seen as another nail in the coffin for a two-state solution. Jordan's King Abdullah, who met Trump in Washington on Tuesday, has already warned against any attempts to ""annex land and displace the Palestinians"". Jordan and Egypt fear that any acceptance of Trump's plan could provoke massive popular backlash and fuel new instability in the region. Recognising the legitimacy of Israel's settlements in the West Bank would be a hugely consequential move. Most of the rest of the world regards them as illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this. During previous rounds of peace talks, negotiators recognised that Israel would get to hold onto large settlement blocs as part of a final agreement, probably in exchange for small chunks of Israeli territory. In 2020, Trump brokered the Abraham Accords, which secured the historic normalisation of relations between Israel and two Arab nations, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Bahrain. The UAE signed that agreement on the understanding Israel would not annex parts of the West Bank - an understanding which may now be in jeopardy."

The WFP said the man was one of seven Yemeni staff ""arbitrarily detained"" by local authorities since 23 January. It is unclear when or how he died. His death was announced a day after the UN said it would be pausing all operations in the northern governorate of Saada, a stronghold of the Iran-backed Houthi movement, over safety concerns. The UN said it followed the detention by the Houthis of eight additional UN personnel, including six in Saada. More than 60 staff from the UN, international non-governmental organisations and foreign embassies were already being held. ""This extraordinary and temporary measure seeks to balance the imperative to stay and deliver with the need to have the safety and security of the UN personnel and its partners guaranteed,"" UN spokesman Farhan Haq said. In a post on X on Tuesday, WFP executive director Cindy McCain said the worker who died in detention was named Ahmed and that he was a ""devoted humanitarian and father of 2"" who had helped deliver life-saving food assistance. According to the WFP, he had been working for the agency since 2017. McCain said she was ""heartbroken and outraged by the tragic loss"". ""Humanitarians are #NotATarget,"" she added. There was no immediate comment from Houthi authorities. Yemen has been devastated by a civil war that escalated 10 years ago, when the Houthis seized control of the north-west from the internationally-recognised government and a Saudi-led coalition supported by the US and UK intervened in an effort to restore its rule. The fighting has reportedly left more than 150,000 people dead and triggered one of the world's worst humanitarian crises, with 4.8 million people displaced and 19.5 million - half of the population - in need of some form of aid. Last month, the UN said it was actively engaging with senior Houthi officials to try to secure the release of all its detained employees. Even though they provide a vital lifeline, UN agencies have regularly had problems reaching people in more remote areas outside the major towns and cities, with Houthi officials regularly reported to have obstructed the delivery of humanitarian assistance. Human rights groups have also accused the movement of kidnapping, torturing and arbitrarily detaining hundreds of civilians. In June, the Houthis claimed they had dismantled an ""American-Israeli spy network"" following the detention of 13 UN staff, as well as more than 50 NGO workers and an embassy staff member. The UN human rights chief said the allegation was baseless. The UN Security Council is due to discuss the situation in Yemen later this week. Last month, US President Donald Trump put the Houthis back on his country's list of designated foreign terrorist organisations over their attacks on Red Sea shipping and Israel."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c77rg752nj7o,"Elderly hostage in Gaza was killed in 7 October attack, Israel says",2025-02-11T11:49:34.042Z,David Gritten,"The Israeli military has said an elderly Israeli man was killed during Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on southern Israel and that his body is being held hostage in Gaza. Iraq-born Shlomo Mansour, 86, was abducted by gunmen at his home in Kibbutz Kissufim. His wife, Mazal, managed to escape. The military said the decision to confirm Shlomo's death was based on intelligence gathered in recent months and was approved by an expert committee of the ministry of health. His name is on the Israeli government's list of 33 hostages to be released by Hamas during the first phase of a ceasefire deal that is coming under growing strain. So far, 16 living Israeli hostages have been freed in exchange for hundreds of Palestinian prisoners held in Israeli jails since 19 January. Hamas has also handed over five Thai hostages. The remaining 17 Israeli hostages - two children, one woman, five men over the age of 50, and nine men under 50 - are supposed to be released over the next three weeks. Both sides have said eight of those hostages are dead but not named them. On Monday, Hamas warned that it would postpone the scheduled release of the next group of three this weekend unless US, Qatari and Egyptian mediators addressed what it said were Israeli violations of the deal, including delays in allowing in shelters and medical supplies. The threat prompted US President Donald Trump to propose that Israel cancel the deal and ""let hell break out"" if Hamas did not release all the hostages by midday on Saturday. Israeli defence minister Israel Katz said Hamas's move was a complete violation of the ceasefire agreement and told the Israeli military to prepare for any possible scenario in Gaza. Shlomo Mansour was born in Baghdad and as a child survived the Farhud pogrom against the Iraqi capital's Jewish community in 1941. He emigrated to Israel with his family at the age of 13 and went on to help found Kibbutz Kissufim, where he worked in the chicken coop and eyewear factory. On 7 October 2023, hundreds of Hamas-led gunmen stormed the Israel's Gaza perimeter fence and attacked many nearby Israeli communities, including Kissufim. They killed about 1,200 people were killed and took 251 others back to Gaza as hostages. Shlomo and Mazal - who had five children and 12 grandchildren - fled to their home's safe room that day, but a group of gunmen fired at the door and were able to break it open. Mazal hid in the bathroom, but they found Shlomo, handcuffed him, and took him out of the house. On Tuesday, the Israeli military said it had informed the Mansour family that he was then murdered by the gunmen and that they took his body back to Gaza as a hostage. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said he and his wife, Sara, sent their heartfelt condolences to the family following the ""bitter news"". ""We will neither rest nor be silent until he is returned for burial in Israel,"" he added. ""We will continue to take determined and relentless action until we return all of our hostages - the living and the deceased."" The Hostages and Missing Families Forum, which represents some of the hostages' relatives, said: ""We share in the profound grief of the Mansour family."" On Monday, in response to Hamas's threat to postpone the next hostage release, the forum called on mediators to help restore and implement the ceasefire deal effectively so that the remaining 76 hostages are brought home. ""Recent evidence from those released, as well as the shocking conditions of the hostages released last Saturday, leaves no room for doubt - time is of the essence, and all hostages must be urgently rescued from this horrific situation,"" it warned. The Israeli government was furious at the emaciated state of Eli Sharabi, 52, Ohad Ben Ami, 56, and Or Levy, 34, who were paraded in front of a crowd in Deir al-Balah before being handed over to the Red Cross. An Israeli doctor who treated Mr Sharabi and Mr Levy said they were in a ""poor medical condition"", while a hospital official said Mr Ben Ami was in a ""severe nutritional sate and had lost a significant amount of his body weight"". Meanwhile, the family of another hostage, Alon Ohel, 24, said on Sunday they had received their first indication in 16 months that he was alive from Mr Levy and Mr Sharabi, who were held captive along with him. ""Since his kidnapping, Alon has been held in harsh conditions in Hamas's underground tunnels, without daylight or access to basic human necessities,"" a statement said. ""We have been informed that Alon is wounded in his eye. Additionally, he is being held in particularly severe captivity conditions, with serious food shortages."" The Ohel family also urged the Israeli government to advance negotiations with Hamas on the ceasefire deal's second phase, which should see the remaining living hostages released, a permanent ceasefire, and a complete Israeli withdrawal from Gaza. More than 48,200 people have been killed in Gaza since the Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to the 7 October attack, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cd649p8yq16o,Paul Adams: Why the Gaza ceasefire is under growing strain,2025-02-11T02:02:42.640Z,Paul Adams,"Why has Hamas announced a delay just days before it is due to release the next group of hostages? In one of its official statements, released on Telegram, the group called its announcement a ""warning"" to Israel and said it was giving mediators ""ample time to pressure the occupation [Israel] into fulfilling its obligations"". It said the ""door remains open"" for the next scheduled releases to go ahead on Saturday. The group appears to be giving time for the impasse to be resolved. But what exactly is the impasse? Hamas lists a series of complaints, from delaying the return of displaced people, continuing to open fire on them and failing to allow the entry of certain types of humanitarian aid. Other Palestinian officials not connected with Hamas have cited Israel's reluctance to allow caravans into Gaza to house the vast numbers of Palestinians whose homes have been destroyed. At a time when the Israeli government is openly discussing ways to encourage civilians to leave Gaza, the failure to give permits for badly needed temporary accommodation is bound to stoke Palestinian fears of expulsion. Fears exacerbated, almost every day, by Donald Trump. What began as an apparently off-the-cuff suggestion that most Palestinians should leave while the Gaza Strip is rebuilt has morphed into the president's demand that all should leave and that the US should take over and run Gaza. As Trump continues to double down on his incendiary suggestion, Hamas may be wondering whether it's worth engaging in phase two of the ceasefire talks. What exactly are the talks for? If Trump is serious, the Palestinians know that it will fall to Israel to make sure that Gaza is devoid of civilians. Depriving them of shelter won't be enough. It will almost certainly require force. Now Trump has said that if all the hostages held in Gaza are not returned by Saturday he will propose cancelling the ceasefire and ""all hell"" will break out. But he did say he was speaking for himself and ""Israel can override it"". Faced with the possible resumption of war, Hamas may be wondering what incentive there is to release the remaining hostages. For relatives and friends of the hostages, the current impasse, and Trump's noisy intervention, is cause for fresh anxiety. ""Each of these statements or announcements, of course, make Hamas more stubborn,"" Dudi Zalmanovich told the BBC. His wife's nephew, Omer Shem Tov, is still being held by Hamas. ""I would prefer him to be less proactive,"" Mr Zalmanovich said of Trump. Israel has its own suspicions about the rationale behind Hamas's threatened delay. The spectacle of emaciated hostages being released at the weekend has raised fears that Hamas may not want the world to see others in even worse condition. On top of the televised scenes of well-armed Hamas fighters parading in broad daylight, and warnings from the former US Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, that the group has recruited as many soldiers as it's lost during the war, not all Israelis believe the ceasefire can – or even should – hold. It's too early to say whether this carefully negotiated, staged process is about to collapse – as many have predicted it will – but after a mostly positive start, it's under increasing strain."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5ye69ey4pyo,"Hamas says it will postpone hostage release, blaming Israel",2025-02-11T00:51:48.446Z,Raffi Berg & Ruth Comerford,"A spokesman for the armed wing of Hamas says the group is postponing the next scheduled release of Israeli hostages, blaming what he says are Israeli violations of the ceasefire deal. Three hostages held in Gaza are due to be freed on Saturday in exchange for more Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. Israel's Defence Minister Israel Katz called the Hamas announcement a ""complete violation of the ceasefire agreement"". Key Israeli ally US President Donald Trump has suggested the ceasefire should be cancelled if ""all"" the hostages held in Gaza are not returned by Saturday. ""I'd say they ought to be returned by 12 o'clock on Saturday... all of them, not in dribs and drabs, not two and one and three and four and two,"" he said. ""I'm speaking for myself,"" he stressed. ""Israel can override it."" Seventy-three hostages taken during Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023, and three others taken a decade earlier, are still being held in Gaza. If hostages were not released, Trump added, ""All hell is going to break out."" Asked whether he meant retaliation from Israel, he said: ""You'll find out, and they'll find out too. Hamas will find out what I mean."" Katz said he had ordered the Israel Defense Forces to ""prepare at the highest level of alert for any possible scenario in Gaza and to protect the communities"". ""We will not allow a return to the reality of 7 October,"" the Israeli defence minister added. Hamas's announcement came shortly before people gathered in Tel Aviv to mark the 24th birthday of Israeli hostage Alon Ohel, his second in captivity. He was taken hostage from the Nova festival on 7 October 2023. Mia Goldstein, an attendee at the rally for Ohel, told the BBC there should be ""immense pressure"" to get the rest of hostages out, adding Hamas's delay was ""horrifying"". Michal Neeman, who took part in a protest in Tel Aviv following the announcement from Hamas, said the hostages ""should have been out a few months ago. You see the situation, they are dying there, and their blood is on this government's hands"". UN spokesperson Farhan Haq said ""any delays"" to the fragile ceasefire deal would be an issue and all parties involved should adhere to their previously stated agreements and timelines. Hamas has said the ""door remains open"" to the exchange going ahead on Saturday if Israel ""complies"" with its obligations, according to news agency AFP. Hamas spokesman Abu Obeida accused Israel of delaying the return of displaced Palestinians to the north of Gaza, firing on people and failing to allow in agreed humanitarian aid. The group's announcement did not refer to Trump or US policy but it comes after strong remarks made last week by the US president about the US taking ownership of Gaza and redeveloping it. His proposal included the resettlement of Palestinians outside the territory and was praised as ""revolutionary and creative"" by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The militant group's statement is the latest in a series of recriminatory actions between the two sides. Israel delayed by two days allowing displaced Palestinians to return to the north of Gaza, accusing Hamas of reneging on a commitment to free a female Israeli civilian hostage. Israel also recently briefly delayed buses taking Palestinian prisoners to be released into the occupied West Bank, after expressing anger over the way in which hostages were released through crowds of spectators in Gaza hours earlier. On Friday, Hamas exceeded by a short time a deadline to release the names of hostages to be freed on Saturday - as required under the ceasefire - prompting concern in Israel. This came after it accused Israel of failing to abide by its commitment to boost the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza –contradicting what had been described by the UN's humanitarian chief as a ""massive surge"". Since the ceasefire began on 19 January, 16 Israeli and five Thai hostages have been released in exchange for 566 prisoners. By the end of the first stage of the ceasefire in three weeks' time, 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are expected to have been freed. Israel says eight of the 33 are dead. Hamas took 251 hostages and killed about 1,200 people when it attacked in October 2023. Israel launched a military campaign in response, killing at least 48,000 Palestinians, according to the Hamas-run health ministry."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn4znw1ex1eo,Anger over Israel's arrest of East Jerusalem bookshop owners,2025-02-10T14:54:21.336Z,Wyre Davies,"An Israeli police raid on a well-known chain of Palestinian bookshops in occupied East Jerusalem and the detention of their owners has shocked many people in the city's cultural, journalistic and diplomatic communities, who have described it as heavy handed and unjustified. Mahmoud Muna and his nephew, Ahmad, have been detained since Sunday on broad charges of disrupting public order. Their lawyer, Nasser Odeh, said they had been kept overnight in freezing conditions. An application to further detain them under house arrest and ban them from their Educational Bookshop stores was also made by police, Mr Odeh said. The men run three bookshops which are popular with tourists, journalists and diplomats. They specialise in books, newspapers and comics about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, Middle Eastern history and culture. Between them, the three shops have hundreds of publications in several languages and are a focal point of the city's cultural scene. But, according to the men's families, on Sunday afternoon, plain clothes police raided two of the shops on Salah ad-Din Street, without warning. Using online translating applications, they removed any books with the words ""Palestine"" or ""Palestinian"" in the title, as well as publications showing the red, green and white Palestinian flag. Among the publications seized were recently released books on the conflict in Gaza as well as books featuring work by the artist Banksy and a children's colouring book about the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory. An Israeli police statement said the two men were arrested on suspicion of ""selling books containing incitement and support for terrorism"". The statement said that police would ""continue their efforts to thwart incitement and support for terrorism, as well as apprehend those involved in offences that threaten the security of Israel's citizens"". That justification for raiding the bookstores and arresting their owners has been roundly condemned by their supporters and customers as another disturbing assault on Palestinian cultural institutions, after previous actions against theatres and educational facilities. Nathan Thrall, the Pulitzer prize-winning American author, launched his book, A Day in the Life of Abed Salama: Anatomy of a Jerusalem Tragedy, at the Educational Bookshop and is a friend of the owners. Outside their court hearing he said: ""This is part of a long-standing policy of crushing any perceived assertion of Palestinian nationalism in East Jerusalem... so they went into the store and took any book with the name 'Palestine' on it."" He added: ""Only an ideology as thin as paper is threatened by the words on a page."" Other supporters, chanting slogans calling for the men's release, said the confiscation of books and other literary material raised dark images from history where authoritarian regimes often began their assault on freedoms and minority rights with such actions. Although the men remain in custody, amid growing calls for them to be released and the presence of several diplomats from European and global consulates at the court, one of the stores later re-opened and several people were soon passing by to express their support."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g3yyv4egeo,Israel troops withdraw from corridor that split Gaza in two,2025-02-09T21:41:48.129Z,Joe Inwood Paulin Kola,"Israeli troops have withdrawn from the Netzarim Corridor - a military zone cutting off the north of the Gaza Strip from the south. Hundreds of Palestinians in cars and on carts laden with mattresses and other goods began returning to northern Gaza following the pull-out - often to scenes of utter destruction. The Israeli withdrawal is in line with the Israel-Hamas ceasefire agreement of 19 January under which 16 Israeli hostages and 566 Palestinian prisoners have so far been freed. By the end of the first stage of the ceasefire in three weeks' time, 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are expected to have been freed. Israel says eight of the 33 are dead. Hamas seized 251 hostages and killed about 1,200 people when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, triggering the Gaza war. At least 48,189 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. About two-thirds of Gaza's buildings have been damaged or destroyed by Israel's attacks, the UN says. On Sunday, crowds of Palestinians were seen traversing the Netzarim Corridor - mostly moving north to see what had happened to their abandoned homes. ""What we saw was a catastrophe, horrific destruction. The [Israeli] occupation destroyed all the homes, shops, farms, mosques, universities and the courthouse,"" Osama Abu Kamil, a resident of al-Maghraqa just north of Netzarim, told the AFP news agency. The 57-year-old, who had been forced to live for more than a year in the southern Gazan city of Khan Yunis, said he now planned to ""set up a tent for me and my family next to the rubble of our house"". ""We have no choice,"" he added. Mahmoud al-Sarhi, another displaced Palestinian, told AFP that for him ""arriving at the Netzarim Corridor meant death until this morning"". He said this was ""the first time I saw our destroyed house"", referring to his home in the nearby Zeitun area. ""The entire area is in ruins. I cannot live here,"" he added. About 700,000 residents of northern Gaza fled to southern areas at the start of the war, when the Israeli military issued mass evacuation orders before launching a ground invasion of the Palestinian territory. Many of those displaced were subsequently forced to move multiple times after Israeli forces pushed into southern Gaza, too. They were also prevented from returning to their homes through the Netzarim Corridor, stretching from the Gaza-Israel border to the Mediterranean Sea. Israeli forces partially withdrew from the west of the corridor last month and the first Palestinians - pedestrians - were allowed to walk along the coastal Rashid Street as they crossed into northern Gaza. Those on vehicles have to use Salah al-Din Street and undergo screening for weapons by US and Egyptian security contractors. The Israel Defense Forces have not officially commented on Sunday's withdrawal from the eastern part of the corridor, which will leave it in control of Gaza's borders, but not the road that had cut it in half. The Haaretz newspaper says the Hamas-run Gaza interior ministry has been urging people to ""exercise caution and adhere to the existing movement guidelines for their safety"". The troop withdrawal comes as an Israeli delegation is expected to fly to Qatar which has been moderating talks between the two sides in the Gaza war. The Israeli government has previously said the delegation will initially discuss ""technical matters"" regarding the first phase of the ceasefire deal, rather than the more challenging second phase which is meant to lead to a permanent ceasefire, the exchange of all remaining living hostages in Gaza for more Palestinian prisoners and a complete withdrawal of Israeli forces from Gaza. That will require further direction from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who recently became the first foreign leader to meet US President Donald Trump since his return to the White House. During the trip, in the most dramatic shift in US policy regarding Gaza in decades, Trump called for the removal of the territory's entire civilian population and the development of what he called ""The Riviera of the Middle East"". Convening his first cabinet meeting since returning to Israel over the weekend, Netanyahu said Trump had come up with a ""completely different vision, much better for the State of Israel"". ""A revolutionary, creative vision - and we are discussing it,"" he was quoted as saying in an official readout of the meeting. ""He [Trump] is very determined to carry it out. It also opens up many possibilities for us."" Trump's proposal, which would be a crime under international law, has been almost universally rejected, including by Arab states. The Saudi foreign ministry said on Saturday that it would not accept ""any infringement on the Palestinians' unalienable rights, and any attempts at displacement,"" accusing Israel of ""ethnic cleansing"". Egypt has also rejected any idea of the removal of the Palestinian population and has said it is calling an emergency summit of the Arab League on 27 February to discuss what it called ""serious"" Palestinian developments."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/clyz7124dppo,What will anger at sight of gaunt hostages mean for a fragile ceasefire?,2025-02-08T22:24:04.391Z,Joe Inwood,"The sight of Eli Sharabi being interviewed on stage, surrounded by Hamas fighters, has caused heartbreak and fury in equal measure amongst Israelis. ""How do you feel?"" he is asked by a masked interviewer. ""I feel very happy today to return to... my wife and daughters"", he answers, seemingly unaware they were killed in Hamas's attack on Israel on 7 October 2023. The scene was broadcast live around the world, the stage-managed handover of hostages, to send a message. The ranks of armed fighters, the banner in Arabic, Hebrew and English declaring ""We are the flood... the war's next day"" - all filmed on modern camera equipment - says to the world they are still in charge in the Gaza Strip and intend to remain so. In previous exchanges, Hamas have also sought to give the impression that they had taken good care of those they had kidnapped. It was not possible this time. All three men looked gaunt and sunken-eyed. As their images were broadcast into Tel Aviv's Hostages Square, the mood changed from one of celebration to anguish. ""It's complicated,"" said 21-year-old Ruth Senderovich, who was watching on the big screens. ""It's the greatest joy that I've had in a while, and it's also devastating because you see men that were leaders of the family, they were fathers, and now you see broken men."" Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel ""will not gloss over the shocking scenes"", and that action would be taken accordingly, without specifying what that would be. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which facilitates the transfers, said it was ""increasingly concerned about the conditions surrounding release operations"" - calling for them to be ""dignified and private"". But it is not only Hamas who have come under fierce criticism for the condition of the people they have been releasing. Shortly after the three hostages were freed, 183 Palestinians - some serving long sentences for their part in the killings of Israelis, others held without charge - left Israeli jails. One of those being released was Jamal al-Tawil, the former mayor of al-Bireh. He has spent nearly two decades in and out of Israeli prisons, in part over allegations that he helped plot suicide bombings. Recently he had been on hunger strike to protest against his detention without charge. His daughter, who was herself recently released from prison, claimed that he was beaten in the final moments before his release. He had to be carried from the bus to the hospital while connected to a ventilator. According to the Palestinian Red Crescent, seven of those being released from Israeli jails needed hospital treatment following their imprisonment. There have been numerous reports since 7 October 2023, accusing the Israeli authorities of abusing Palestinian prisoners. The question now is what impact, if any, Saturday's releases will have on the fragile ceasefire deal. Israel has said it is sending negotiators to Qatar to discuss ""technical issues"", before they begin talks around the next phase. It has also warmly welcomed the suggestion by US President Donald Trump that Gaza would be emptied of Palestinians. Hamas, meanwhile, has accused Israel of a ""lack of commitment"" regarding the ceasefire, but said that the group is still ready to join any talks. Hamas also released a slickly produced video of the release of the three hostages. Filmed in underground tunnels, apparently learning they are to be released. They speak to the camera, thanking God and then putting on uniforms with their own photos on them. The release of the video was soon followed by a statement from the families asking for it not to be broadcast. For all the anger about the condition of those being held, there was another conclusion that many have drawn from today. A deal to secure their freedom - and a permanent end to the fighting - cannot come soon enough. For in the gaunt, haunted faces of those being freed, was written the cost of delay."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g9vyz747eo,Hostages freed and prisoners released in latest ceasefire exchange,2025-02-08T20:47:35.542Z,Raffi Berg & Mallory Moench,"Hamas has freed three Israeli hostages in Gaza, while Israel released 183 Palestinian prisoners in the latest exchange as part of an internationally brokered ceasefire deal. The three hostages - Eli Sharabi, Ohad Ben Ami and Or Levy - were handed over to the Red Cross on Saturday morning before reuniting with their families in Israel. Concerns have been raised about their wellbeing, with Mr Sharabi's family - who live in the UK - describing their shock at his ""gaunt"" appearance. Returning Palestinian prisoners were greeted with scenes of celebration at Ramallah in the occupied West Bank. Representatives claimed they all needed ""medical care"", without giving specifics. So far, 16 Israeli hostages and 566 prisoners have been freed since the ceasefire began on 19 January. By the end of the first stage of the ceasefire in three weeks time, 33 hostages and 1,900 prisoners are expected to have been freed. Israel says eight of the 33 are dead. Five Thai hostages have also been released during this period following a separate agreement. As Mr Sharabi, Mr Ben Ami and Mr Levy were handed over to the Red Cross in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza, crowds lined up, cordoned off by a row of armed fighters, to watch and film on mobile phones, as Hamas and Palestinian flags flew. A Hamas official and Red Cross representative signed paperwork on a stage to complete the handover. The hostages were then paraded on stage, flanked by men with guns. The three men posed holding certificates and answered questions into a microphone, before waving as they were ushered into Red Cross vehicles. Israeli President Isaac Herzog expressed horror at the physical state of the men who he said were ""returning after 491 days of hell, starved, emaciated and pained"". Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu also criticised the men's state, saying ""we have seen again what the monsters of Hamas are"". He also accused Hamas of ""repeated violations"" of the ceasefire deal, without providing specifics. Speaking to BBC Arabic on Saturday, Hamas spokesman Hazem Qassem said the latest release of Israeli hostages had been carried out in a ""civilised manner"". He also accused Israel of ""dragging its feet"" on implementing humanitarian relief agreed as part of the ceasefire. Netanyahu's co-ordinator of prisoners and missing persons said Israel treated the issues with ""great severity"" and would raise them with ceasefire mediators and take action. Mr Sharabi's brother-in-law, Steve Brisley, told the BBC that having confirmation he is alive is ""what we've been working toward for the last 16 months"". It was ""incredibly difficult"" to see him ""thin, gaunt"" and being paraded by Hamas, Mr Brisley said. ""It's the light that's gone from his eyes that's really struck home for me."" Eli Sharabi, 52, was taken from Kibbutz Beeri with his brother, Yossi, whose death has since been confirmed. Eli's British-born wife, Lianne, and two British-Israeli daughters, Noiya and Yahel, were murdered in the attack. During his release, Mr Sharabi was filmed saying he was ""very happy today to return to...my wife and daughters"", adding to concerns he was unaware his family had been killed. In a statement, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer said: ""I shared the relief of so many at Eli Sharabi's release earlier today but was dismayed to see his frail condition and the circumstances of his release."" The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said in a statement that ""the disturbing images"" of the release ""serve as yet another stark and painful evidence that leaves no room for doubt - there is no time to waste for the hostages! We must get them all out, down to the very last hostage"". Meanwhile, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), which facilitated the handover, said it was ""increasingly concerned about the conditions surrounding release operations"". ""We strongly urge all parties, including the mediators, to take responsibility to ensure that future releases are dignified and private,"" it said. Later on Saturday, Israel released 183 Palestinian prisoners. More than 70 are serving life or long sentences, and 111 are Gazans detained during the war. Seven are due to be deported. Seven of the released prisoners were admitted to hospital in Ramallah because of poor health, the Palestinian Prisoners' Club told AFP. ""All the prisoners who were released today are in need of medical care, treatment, and examinations as a result of the brutality they were subjected to during the past months,"" the group's Abdullah al-Zaghari said. One of those released was Jamal al-Tawil, 61, a prominent Hamas politician in the occupied West Bank and former mayor of the village of al-Bireh, who has spent more than 19 years in and out of Israeli prisons. His daughter Bushra al-Tawil was freed in an earlier prisoner release in January. Both father and daughter were most recently held without charge, media reported. Khadra al-Daghma, the mother of another released Palestinian prisoner, described feeling ""so happy, overjoyed"" having seen her son for the first time in 15 years. ""My heart is filled with happiness,"" she told a reporter in Gaza, adding that her son, Ammar Fadel al-Daghma, had ""changed a lot"" and was ""not the same"". According to the Israeli Prison Service, he was detained for offences including arson, attempted murder and service to an illegal organisation. Hamas seized 251 hostages and killed about 1,200 people when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, triggering the war. At least 47,500 Palestinians have been killed in Israel's offensive, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. About two-thirds of Gaza's buildings have been damaged or destroyed by Israel's attacks, the UN says. Ohad Ben Ami, 56, was also taken from Kibbutz Beeri, along with his wife, Raz. She was later released by Hamas. Mr Ben Ami, an accountant, is ""known for his good judgment and sense of humour"", according to the Hostages Families Forum. Or Levy, 34, a computer programmer from Rishon LeZion, a city south of Tel Aviv, fled the Nova festival with his wife Eynav, when gunmen attacked the event. Mr Levy was taken hostage and Eynav's body was found in a bomb shelter where the couple had been hiding. In a statement, Mr Levy's family said: ""Our hearts tremble and our minds struggle to comprehend the sight of Or, who has returned to us in such a devastating state. His face bears witness to the hell he endured during 491 days in the hands of Hamas monsters. ""After an unbearable period of darkness, we can finally embrace him again and begin healing his body and spirit,"" the statement said. On Friday, Hamas accused Israel of failing to abide by its commitment to boost the amount of humanitarian aid allowed into Gaza as part of the ceasefire deal. The head of Hamas's media office in Gaza, Salama Marouf said ""the humanitarian situation remains catastrophic due to Israeli obstruction"". He said only 8,500 out of an expected 12,000 aid lorries had entered Gaza since 19 January, and medical equipment and shelter supplies had been deliberately delayed. The allegation contradicts UN humanitarian chief Tom Fletcher, who on Thursday said 10,000 lorries with food, medicine and tents had crossed into Gaza since the start of the ceasefire. Saturday's exchange took place as US President Donald Trump continued to push his widely criticised proposal to move all Palestinians from Gaza and redevelop it as an international travel destination. His announcement - for the US to ""take over"" the Gaza Strip, resettle its Palestinian population and turn the territory into the ""Riviera of the Middle East"" - has complicated talks on the planned next stage of the ceasefire. But Israeli negotiators are still expected to meet mediators in Qatar later on Saturday. Trump's idea was strongly condemned by Arab countries and the UN."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cge7x0y343lo,Oscar-nominated West Bank feature director says films 'can be part of change',2025-02-07T02:01:10.243Z,Mallory Moench,"A Palestinian and an Israeli sit in a West Bank village at night. They wonder aloud whether Basel will ever be able to freely visit Yuval's home in Israel, whether Basel's village will get building permits, and whether they will one day have stability. For years, the friends have been filming the destruction of houses, a well and a school by the Israeli army after a court order declared Basel's community illegal. They tell each other they hope they will change that reality. Now, that scene has reached some of the world's biggest stages. The film it is in, No Other Land, has been nominated for an Oscar and a Bafta for best documentary feature. It follows the fight over Masafer Yatta, a community of around 20 villages, and the friendship between Basel Adra and Israeli journalist Yuval Abraham. In the film Basel is nearly detained after a protest, his father is arrested, and a soldier shoots a community member in the neck while confiscating a generator, leading to the man's paralysis and death. ""It's scary because yes, the film is succeeding and people are aware of it, but I don't think there is sufficient action, especially amongst those who have power to change this,"" Yuval told the BBC. ""I don't have an illusion that films are going to change the world, but I know they can change individuals, and I know that they can be part of a bigger change, and we really need this now."" Basel and Yuval created the film along with Hamdan Ballal and Rachel Szor over five years. Asked about the man who was paralysed, the IDF said its investigation had found no crime. A spokesperson said that during an operation against ""illegal construction"", two Palestinians had grabbed a soldier by his weapon and vest, leading to the shot. Palestinian eyewitnesses told Israeli media they were not contacted as part of the initial investigation and believed the shot was fired intentionally. Israel has occupied the West Bank since 1967. Israeli settlements in the territory are considered illegal under international law, though Israel disputes this. They have expanded over the past 55 years, becoming a focal point of violence and conflicting claims over land. On 7 October 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, killing about 1,200 people and taking 251 hostages. That triggered an Israeli military campaign that has killed at least 47,500 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry. Since then, settler-related violence in the West Bank has increased, with 13 Palestinians killed by settlers, according to the UN. More than 850 Palestinians, many of them militants, have been killed by Israeli troops in the West Bank in the same period, the Palestinian health ministry says. The UN says 30 Israelis were killed by Palestinians in the West Bank during that timeframe. In 2024, the UN recorded about 1,420 incidents of Israeli settler violence – the highest number that reportedly led to casualties, property damage or both, since records began in 2006. Additional attacks on Palestinians had occurred since US President Donald Trump's return to power, Basel said, and the filmmakers feared it could worsen. Trump has lifted sanctions the Biden administration had placed on some settlers. The president's ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, has said Israel has a ""title deed"" to the West Bank and ""there's no such thing"" as occupation or settlements. When asked on Tuesday whether he agreed the US should recognise Israeli sovereignty over the occupied West Bank, Trump said he had yet to take a position but that he would make an announcement in four weeks' time. The debate over Masafer Yatta began in the 1980s when Israel declared the area a closed military firing zone, meaning no one was allowed to live there. According to notes from a 1981 meeting, then-Israeli Agricultural Minister Ariel Sharon offered the military additional training areas to restrict the ""expansion of the Arab villagers from the hills towards the desert"". Israel argued residents previously did not live there permanently. The Palestinian population took their case to Israel's Supreme Court, arguing communities had lived there for generations and pointing to a 1945 map showing some villages. In 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in favour of Israel and allowed the demolition of homes and expulsion of more than 1,000 villagers. Scenes from the film show a bulldozer destroying a primary school, a truck pouring mud into a well, and machinery crushing a home as villagers confront the army. A girl cries, and when her mother is asked if she has any other place to go she says: ""We have no other land."" The documentary also records intimate human moments, like when the mother, who moves into a cave, kisses her daughter and tells her: ""You're my love... Tomorrow will be a new day."" The film explores Basel and Yuval's friendship as well. Though they are around the same age and share similar values, their inequality is ever-present. While Yuval can travel freely in Israel and the West Bank, Basel cannot travel into Israel without a permit, as part of what it says are security measures. In the film, Basel laments that although he studied law, he could only find work in construction in Israel, and when he thinks about it too hard, ""I feel this huge depression."" The film does not shy away from the tension created by Yuval's identity, with one Palestinian asking him: ""How can we remain friends, when you come here, and it could be your brother or friend who destroyed my home?"" Yuval told the BBC he felt ""responsibility for what is happening to Basel's community"" because ""at the end of the day, the fuel in the bulldozers is my tax money"". Last year, Yuval faced a backlash for his acceptance speech for the best documentary award at the Berlin Film Festival, alongside Basel, in which he criticised a ""situation of apartheid"" and called for a ceasefire in Gaza. US filmmaker Ben Russell, who was there and wore a Palestinian keffiyeh scarf, said he stood against ""genocide"" in Gaza. Israel strongly denies the accusation of genocide. German Culture Minister Claudia Roth said the statements were ""shockingly one-sided and characterised by a deep hatred of Israel"", while Berlin Mayor Kai Wegner posted on social media that it was an ""intolerable relativisation"" and that ""antisemitism has no place in Berlin"". Israel's public broadcaster called Yuval's comments antisemitic. Yuval, who said he received death threats, told the BBC he was ""very angry"" at the label, which was ""emptying this term of meaning at a time when antisemitism is rising on the right wing and on the left wing"". He said it was ""absurd"" to hear the criticism when most of his family was killed in the Holocaust, adding that learning from this history ""should tell us to fight against dehumanisation… no matter who is the victim"". Despite winning several international awards, No Other Land is self-distributing in the US because it has not found an official distributor there – rare for a documentary which has been nominated for an Oscar. One of the film's last scenes is from 13 October 2023, when Basel recorded a settler shooting his cousin, whose hands appear empty, in the stomach. In other footage, settlers throw rocks at homes while soldiers watch. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the shooting case was transferred to the state attorney's office, which the BBC approached for comment. Currently in Masafer Yatta, Basel said settlers have ""unlimited power"" and there is a ""daily level of harassment"". He said there were three major settler attacks in January, including on a 72-year-old taken to hospital after he was hit in the head with sticks, and around 15 people arrested in the two days before 30 January while grazing their sheep or chasing away settlers' sheep. Israel Police did not reply to a BBC request for comment. The UK has sanctioned three settler outposts and four organisations it says are supporting violence against West Bank communities. Yuval called on the UK to sanction all settlers, believing that would ""truly be a deterrent"". A foreign office spokesperson told the BBC the foreign secretary ""has been clear with Israeli ministers that they must clamp down on settler violence and end settlement expansion"". ""We have regularly taken action against settler violence, including through targeted sanctions, and will continue to do all we can to ensure the rights of Palestinians are protected and that those responsible for violence are held to account,"" the statement read. Yuval said: ""I really believe there is no other way forward, other than reaching a just, fair political solution where Palestinians can be free, truly free, and our people, both of them, will have security and self-determination. ""It really makes me angry, not only that my government is going in the other way, but that the world is allowing it to happen for so long."" In the film, Basel recalls a seven-minute visit by Tony Blair to his village – after which Israel cancelled demolition orders there. ""This is a story about power,"" he says. Now, Basel gets ""strength and power from the people around me"", making him want to not give up. ""One water drop doesn't make change,"" he says during a protest in the film, ""but keep dropping the water and it will make change."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cqldpyn5ng6o,Israeli soldier jailed for abusing Palestinian detainees from Gaza,2025-02-06T22:19:32.476Z,David Gritten,"An Israeli military court has sentenced a soldier to seven months in prison after he admitted to the aggravated abuse of Palestinian detainees from Gaza at the Sde Teiman military detention centre. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) said the reservist, who it did not name, was convicted over ""several incidents in which he punched the detainees with his fists and used his weapon while they were handcuffed and blindfolded"". ""These acts were committed in the presence of other soldiers, some of whom called on him to stop, and were even documented on the defendant's mobile phone,"" it added. The Haaretz newspaper said he was the first soldier convicted of abusing Gazans held during the war with Hamas. He had made the Palestinians say demeaning phrases and make animal noises, and beat them while they were bound and blindfolded, Haaretz reported. It also cited the Beit Lid Military Court as saying the soldier admitted to three counts of aggravated abuse and one count of unbecoming conduct as part of a plea deal with prosecutors. They related to four separate incidents between January and June 2024, when he was guarding lorries transporting detainees, it said. According to Haaretz, the court found an unspecified number of masked soldiers, whose identities remain unknown, had also participated in the abuse. In addition to the prison term, the convicted soldier was also given a suspended sentence and demoted to the rank of private, according to the IDF. ""Soldiers have a duty to use the force entrusted to them in accordance with IDF values and orders, at all times and in times of war in particular,"" the IDF said. The Sde Teiman detention facility was set up after the start of the Gaza war 15 months ago. Since then, it has been at the centre of reports of serious abuses. In July, far-right protesters broke into Sde Teiman after Israeli military police went there to question nine reservists suspected of raping a detainee and causing a life-threatening injury to him. Several of the reservists were subsequently arrested. In October, a report by a UN commission of inquiry alleged that thousands of child and adult detainees from Gaza had been ""subjected to widespread and systematic abuse, physical and psychological violence, and sexual and gender-based violence amounting to the war crime and crime against humanity of torture and the war crime of rape and other forms of sexual violence"". Israel's government said it rejected the accusations of widespread ill-treatment and torture of detainees, and insisted that it was ""fully committed to international legal standards"". It also said it had carried out thorough investigations into every complaint. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 47,550 people have been killed in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. According to the Israeli rights group HaMoked, 1,802 Palestinians from Gaza are currently being held as ""unlawful combatants"" in Israeli prisons. The figure does not include detainees being held by the military."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c4g9xgj2429o,Trump says Israel will hand over Gaza to US after fighting ends,2025-02-06T17:37:32.421Z,Tinshui Yeung,"US President Donald Trump has restated a vision in which the US would take over Gaza, after officials in his administration appeared to contradict his earlier comments. ""The Gaza Strip would be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting,"" Trump said on Thursday. He reiterated that the idea would mean resettling Palestinians, and that no US soldiers would be needed. Trump's resettlement idea has prompted accusations that he is planning ethnic cleansing, and has drawn condemnation from the UN, human rights groups and Arab leaders. Analysts doubt it will ever happen. After Trump's first comments on the issue, his officials suggested any relocation would be only temporary. Under his plan, Trump wrote on Truth Social, Gazans ""would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region"". The US would then be part of an effort to redevelop the enclave, he said. His post did not make clear whether the two million residents of the Palestinian territory would be invited to return. Under international law, attempts to forcibly transfer populations from occupied territory are strictly prohibited. White House spokeswoman Karoline Leavitt said on Wednesday that any displacement would be temporary. In his own comments, made on the same day, Secretary of State Rubio said the idea was for Gazans to leave the territory for an ""interim"" period while debris was cleared and reconstruction took place. These views contradicted Trump's initial comments on the matter. Speaking on Tuesday, when he proposed the development of Gaza into the ""Riviera of the Middle East"", Trump suggested that the displacement of Palestinians would be permanent. ""The US will take over the Gaza Strip and we will do a job with it too,"" he said on Tuesday during a joint press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who called the idea ""worth paying attention to"". The announcement took even senior Trump aides by surprise due to a lack of planning around the idea, the New York Times reported, citing four anonymous sources with knowledge of the discussions. Trump's fresh comment on Thursday that no American soldiers would be needed was more clearly in agreement with Leavitt, who said the US had not committed to putting ""boots on the ground"". Speaking soon after at a prayer breakfast, the president reflected briefly on the situation in Gaza, but did not mention his stated plans for the US to ""take over"" the territory. After turning his attention to the Middle East, Trump said he hoped ""his greatest legacy will be being known as a peacemaker and a unifier"". Fifteen months of fighting have left the Gaza Strip, a territory 41km (25 miles) long and 10km (6 miles) wide, largely uninhabitable. Entire districts have been razed to the ground. Agricultural land where greenhouses once stood has been reduced to sand and rubble. The UN Environment Programme (UNEP) has warned that it could take 21 years to remove and dispose of all debris. It described the water and sanitation systems as ""almost entirely defunct"", warned of mounting rubbish around camps and shelters, and highlighted the risk that chemicals from destroyed solar panels and the munitions being used could contaminate soil and water supplies. More than 50 million tonnes of debris have accumulated as a result of the destruction, according to the UN body. The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 47,550 people have been killed and 111,600 injured in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjw4zv533g7o,Mosul's landmarks rise again after IS destruction,2025-02-06T15:43:56.633Z,Sebastian Usher,"Historic buildings in Mosul, including churches and mosques, are being reopened following years of devastation resulting from the Iraqi city's takeover by the extremist Islamic State (IS) group. The project, organised and funded by Unesco, began a year after IS was defeated and driven out of the city, in northern Iraq, in 2017. Unesco's director-general Audrey Azoulay attended a ceremony on Wednesday to mark the reopening. Local artisans, residents and representatives of all of Mosul's religious communities were also there. In 2014, IS occupied Mosul, which for centuries was seen as a symbol of tolerance and co-existence between different religious and ethnic communities in Iraq. The group imposed its extreme ideology on the city, targeting minorities and killing opponents. Three years later, a US-backed coalition in alliance with the Iraqi army and state-linked militias mounted an intense ground and air offensive to wrest the city back from IS control. The bloodiest battles focused on the Old City, where the group's fighters made a last stand. Mosul photographer Ali al-Baroodi recalls the horror that greeted him when he first entered the area shortly after the street-by-street battle was over in the summer of 2017. He saw the gloriously skewed al-Hadba minaret, known as the ""hunchback"", which had been emblematic of Mosul for hundreds of years, in ruins. ""It was like a ghost town,"" he says. ""Dead bodies all around, a sickening smell and horrible scenes of the city and the skyline without the Hadba minaret. ""It was not the city that we knew - it was like a metamorphosis - that we never imagined not even in our worst nightmares. I fell silent after that for a couple of days. I lost my voice. I lost my mind."" Eighty per cent of the Old City of Mosul, on the west bank of the Tigris, was destroyed during IS's three-year occupation. It was not just the churches, mosques and old houses that needed to be repaired, but also the community spirit of those who had lived there for so long in relative harmony between religions and ethnicities. The huge task of rebuilding began under the auspices of Unesco with a budget of $115m (£93m) that the agency had managed to drum up, much of it from the United Arab Emirates and the European Union. Father Olivier Poquillon - a Dominican priest - returned to Mosul to help oversee the restoration of one of the key buildings, the convent of Notre-Dame de l'Heure, known locally as al-Saa'a, which was founded nearly 200 years ago. ""We started by trying first to gather the team - a team composed of people from Old Mosul from different denominations - Christians, Muslims working all together,"" he says. Father Poquillon says that bringing the communities together was the biggest challenge and the biggest achievement. ""If you want to rebuild the buildings you've got first to rebuild trust - if you don't rebuild trust, it's useless to reconstruct the walls of those buildings because they will become a target for other communities."" In charge of the entire project - which included the restoration of 124 old houses and two especially fine mansions - has been the chief architect Maria Rita Acetoso, who came to Mosul straight from restoration work for Unesco in Afghanistan. ""This project demonstrates that culture too can create jobs, can encourage skills development and in addition can make those involved feel part of something meaningful,"" she says. She hopes the reconstruction can restore hope and enable the recovery of people's cultural identity and memory. ""I think this is particularly important for the young generations growing up in a situation of conflict and political instability,"" she adds. Unesco says that more than 1,300 local young people have been trained up in traditional skills, while some 6,000 new jobs have been created. More than 100 classrooms were renovated in Mosul. Thousands of historical fragments were recovered and catalogued from the rubble. Among the host of engineers involved in the rebuilding, 30% were women. Eight years on, the bells are ringing out again across Mosul from al-Tahera Church, whose roof collapsed after serious damage under IS occupation in 2017. Other major landmarks of Mosul have also been restored - that wriggling minaret of al-Hadba, the Dominican al-Saa'a Convent and the complex of Al-Nouri mosque. And people have been able to return to the houses that have been home to their families for centuries. One resident, Mustafa, said: ""My house was built in 1864 - unfortunately it was partly destroyed during the liberation of Mosul and it was unsuitable to live there, especially with my children. ""So I decided to move to my parents' house. I was very pleased and excited to see my house rebuilt again."" Abdullah's family has also lived in a house in the Old City since the 19th Century when the area was a centre for the wool trade - which is why he says their home is so precious to them. ""After Unesco rebuilt my house, I came back,"" he says. ""I can't describe the feeling I had because after seeing all the destruction that happened there, I thought I would never be able to come back and live there again."" The scars of what the people of Mosul endured are yet to heal - just as much of Iraq remains in a fragile state. But the Old City's rebirth from the rubble represents hope for a better future - as Ali al-Baroodi continues to document the evolution of his beloved home day by day. ""It's truly like seeing a dead person coming back to life in a very, very beautiful way - that is the true spirit of the city coming back to life,"" he says.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjexp347yxlo,Israel minister tells army to plan for Palestinians leaving Gaza,2025-02-06T13:55:31.208Z,David Gritten,"Israel's defence minister has told its military to prepare a plan to ""allow any resident of Gaza who wishes to leave to do so"", in line with President Donald Trump's proposal for the US to take over the territory and resettle its 2.1 million Palestinians elsewhere. Israel Katz said Gazans should have ""freedom of movement and migration"" and countries critical of Israel's war with Hamas were ""obligated"" to take them in. Israel controls the movement of people into and out of Gaza. Trump meanwhile said Gaza would be ""turned over"" to the US by Israel ""at the conclusion of fighting"". But the Palestinian presidency reiterated its rejection of the plan, which it has said would violate international law, and insisted that ""Palestine... is not for sale"". The Israeli military launched a campaign to destroy Hamas in response to an unprecedented cross-border attack on 7 October 2023, in which about 1,200 people were killed and 251 were taken hostage. More than 47,550 people have been killed and 111,600 injured in Gaza since then, according to the territory's Hamas-run health ministry. Most of Gaza's population has also been displaced multiple times and almost 70% of its buildings are estimated to be destroyed or damaged. Healthcare, water, sanitation and hygiene systems have collapsed and there are shortages of food, fuel, medicine and shelter. The Israeli defence minister wrote on X on Thursday that he welcomed the US president's ""bold initiative"", saying it could ""support long-term reconstruction efforts in a demilitarized, threat-free Gaza after Hamas"". Katz announced that he had instructed the Israeli military to ""prepare a plan that will allow any resident of Gaza who wishes to leave to do so, to any country willing to receive them"". ""The plan will include exit options via land crossings, as well as special arrangements for departure by sea and air,"" he said. ""Countries such as Spain, Ireland, Norway, and others, which have falsely accused Israel over its actions in Gaza, are legally obligated to allow Gazans to enter their territory. Their hypocrisy will be exposed if they refuse."" He alleged that Hamas was preventing people leaving Gaza and said that they should have ""the right to freedom of movement and migration"". Hamas official Basem Naim accused Katz of trying to cover up for ""a state that has failed to achieve any of its objectives in the war on Gaza"" and said Palestinians would refuse to leave. Meanwhile, the spokesman for the Palestinian presidency asserted that ""Palestine, with its land, history and holy sites, is not for sale"". Nabil Abu Rudeineh also said the Palestinians would ""will not give up an inch of their land"", whether in Gaza or the occupied West Bank. ""The Palestinian people and their leadership will not allow the repetition of the catastrophes of 1948 and 1967, and will thwart any plan aimed at liquidating their just cause through investment projects whose place is neither in Palestine nor on its land."" The 1948 ""Nakba"", which means ""catastrophe"" in Arabic, saw hundreds of thousands of Palestinians flee or driven from their homes before and during the war that followed the creation of the State of Israel. Many of those refugees ended up in Gaza, where they and their descendants make up three quarters of the population. Another 900,000 registered refugees live in the West Bank, which Israel occupied in the 1967 Middle East war along with Gaza, while 3.4 million others live in Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, according to the UN. Israel unilaterally withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza in 2005, though it retained control of its shared border, airspace and shoreline, giving it effective control of the movement of people and goods. The UN still regards Gaza as Israeli-occupied territory because of the level of control Israel has. Israel and Egypt imposed a blockade on Gaza, citing security reasons, after Hamas won Palestinian elections in 2006 and ejected its rivals from the territory after intense fighting the following year. On Wednesday, Jordan's king expressed its ""rejection of any attempts to annex land or displace Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank"", while Egypt's foreign minister stressed the importance of reconstruction ""without the Palestinians leaving the Gaza Strip"". Hamas - which is proscribed as a terrorist organisation by Israel, the US, the UK and other countries - said Trump's plan was ""absurd"" and would ""only put oil on the fire"" in the region. The UN human rights office warned that any forcible transfer in, or deportation of, people from occupied territory was strictly prohibited under international law. The UN's secretary general also said it was ""essential to avoid any form of ethnic cleansing"" and stressed that Gaza would be an integral part of a future Palestinian state. Antonio Guterres told a meeting in New York that the world had ""seen a chilling, systematic dehumanisation and demonization of an entire people"". Trump unveiled his plan for the US to take ""long-term ownership"" of Gaza and oversee its reconstruction during a visit to the White House by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Tuesday. The president said most of the Palestinians living in Gaza would have to be relocated to achieve his vision of creating ""the Riviera of the Middle East"", and that they would be housed in Jordan, Egypt and other countries. ""I hope we can do something where they wouldn't want to go back,"" he said, echoing earlier remarks in the Oval Office where he talked about resettling people ""permanently"". At the White House briefing on Wednesday, spokeswoman Caroline Leavitt was asked to confirm whether all Palestinians who wanted to stay in Gaza would be allowed to do so. ""I can confirm that the president is committed to rebuilding Gaza and to temporarily relocating those who are there because... it is a demolition site,"" she replied, appearing to contradict the president. Secretary of State Marco Rubio also said the idea was for Gazans to leave the territory for an ""interim"" period while debris was cleared and reconstruction took place. On Thursday, Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform that Gaza would ""be turned over to the United States by Israel at the conclusion of fighting"". A ceasefire in effect between Israel and Hamas has halted the war and aims to lead to a permanent end to the fighting. ""The Palestinians... would have already been resettled in far safer and more beautiful communities, with new and modern homes, in the region. They would actually have a chance to be happy, safe, and free,"" he added. The president also said no US soldiers would be needed to maintain stability. In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Israel's prime minister called Trump's proposal ""remarkable"" and something that should be ""examined, pursued and done"". Netanyahu also suggested that Gazans would be able to return, saying: ""They can leave, they can then come back, they can relocate and come back, but you have to rebuild Gaza."""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2pwjgp59do,"Jeremy Bowen: Trump's Gaza plan won't happen, but it will have consequences",2025-02-05T18:08:06.318Z,Jeremy Bowen,"Donald Trump's plan for the US to ""take over"" and ""own"" Gaza, resettling its population in the process, is not going to happen. It requires the co-operation of Arab states that have rejected it. They include Jordan and Egypt - countries that Trump wants to take in Gaza's Palestinians - and Saudi Arabia, which might be expected to foot the bill. Western allies of the US and Israel are also against the idea. Some - perhaps many - Palestinians in Gaza might be tempted to get out if they had the chance. But even if a million left, as many as 1.2m others would still be there. Presumably the United States - the new owners of Trump's ""Riviera of the Middle East"" - would have to use force to remove them. After America's catastrophic intervention in Iraq in 2003, that would be deeply unpopular in the US. It would be the final end of any lingering hope that a two-state solution was possible. That is the aspiration that a conflict more than a century old could be ended with the establishment of an independent Palestine alongside Israel. The Netanyahu government is adamantly against the idea, and over years of failed peace talks, ""two states for two peoples"" became an empty slogan. But it has been a central plank of US foreign policy since the early 1990s. The Trump plan would also violate international law. America's already threadbare assertions that it believes in a rules-based international order would dissolve. Russia's territorial ambitions in Ukraine and China's in Taiwan would be turbocharged. Why worry about all that if it is not about to happen - at least not in the way Trump announced in Washington, watched by a grinning and clearly delighted Benjamin Netanyahu? The answer is that Trump's remarks, however outlandish, will have consequences. He is the president of the United States, the most powerful man in the world - no longer a reality TV host and political hopeful trying to grab headlines. Short-term, the disruption caused by his stunning announcement could weaken the fragile ceasefire in Gaza. One senior Arab source told me it could be its ""death knell"". The absence of a plan for Gaza's future governance is already a fault line in the agreement. Now Trump has provided one, and even if it does not come to pass, it presses very big buttons in the minds of Palestinians and Israelis. It will nourish the plans and dreams of ultra-nationalist Jewish extremists who believe all the land between the Mediterranean and the Jordan river, and perhaps beyond, is a God-given Jewish possession. Their leaders are part of Netanyahu's government and keep him in power - and they're delighted. They want the Gaza war to resume with the longer-term objective of removing the Palestinians and replacing them with Jews. The finance minister Bezalel Smotrich said Trump had provided the answer to Gaza's future after the 7 October attacks. His statement said that ""whoever committed the most terrible massacre on our land will find himself losing his land forever. Now we will act to finally bury, with God's help, the dangerous idea of a Palestinian state."" Centrist opposition leaders in Israel have been less effusive, perhaps fearing trouble ahead, but have offered a polite welcome to the plan. Hamas and other Palestinian armed groups may feel the need to answer Trump with some kind of show of force against Israel. For Palestinians, the conflict with Israel is driven by dispossession and the memory of what they call al-Nakba, ""the catastrophe"". That was the exodus of Palestinians as Israel won its war for independence in 1948. More than 700,000 Palestinians either fled or were forced from their homes by Israeli forces. All but a handful were never allowed back and Israel passed laws it still uses to confiscate their property. Now the fear will be that it is happening again. Many Palestinians already believed Israel was using the war against Hamas to destroy Gaza and expel the population. It is part of their accusation that Israel is committing genocide – and now they might believe Donald Trump is adding his weight to Israel's plans. Just because Trump says something, that does not make it true or certain. His statements are often more like opening gambits in a real estate negotiation than expressions of the settled policy of the United States. Perhaps Trump is spreading some confusion while he works on another plan. He is said to crave the Nobel peace prize. Middle East peacemakers, even when they do not ultimately succeed, have a strong track record of winning it. As the world was digesting his Gaza announcement, he posted on his Truth Social platform his desire for a ""verified nuclear peace agreement"" with Iran. The Iranian regime denies it wants nuclear weapons but there has been an open debate in Tehran about whether they are now so threatened that they need the ultimate deterrent. For many years Netanyahu has wanted the US, with Israeli help, to destroy Iran's nuclear sites. Doing a deal with Iran was never part of his plan. During Trump's first term, Netanyahu waged a long and successful campaign to persuade him to pull the US out of the nuclear deal Barack Obama's administration signed with Iran. If Trump wanted to throw the Israeli hard-right something to keep them happy as he makes overtures to the Iranians, he has succeeded. But he has also created uncertainty and injected more instability into the world's most turbulent region."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c78xre2ynd4o,'We won't go out of Gaza': Palestinians express shock and defiance at Trump plan,2025-02-05T17:06:32.183Z,Yolande Knell Rushdi Abualouf,"For most Palestinians living in the Gaza Strip there is already a painful history of forced displacement that is at the heart of their response to US President Donald Trump's plan to take over the war-torn territory. Speaking to the BBC, residents of a tent camp in the central town of Deir al-Balah expressed shock and defiance at the idea of being permanently resettled outside. ""Even if it costs us our souls, we will not leave Gaza,"" said Mahmoud Bahjat, who is from the north. ""We are against Trump's decision. He ended the war but displacing us would end our lives."" On the other hand, many Israelis have been expressing satisfaction at the radical ideas from the White House, particularly those on the far-right who seek to resettle Gaza. Since a ceasefire took hold in Gaza - on the eve of Trump's inauguration last month - there have been dramatic scenes of Palestinians returning to what is left of their homes. Families have piled up possessions into cars and donkey carts or walked long distances along the coastal road, often just to reach piles of rubble. According to the UN, at least 1.9m people, or about 90% of the population, across Gaza became displaced during 15 months of war. The scenes of Palestinians on the move have echoed black-and-white footage from 1948 and the mass evacuations that took place during fighting before and after the creation of the state of Israel. More than 700,000 people were then forced from their homes. The majority of Gazans are descendants of those original refugees. Standing between rows of plastic sheeting in the Deir al-Balah camp, Jamalat Wadi says that her family has now sacrificed enough and that they are determined to build a new home. ""We endured a year and half of war. When [the Israeli military] finally withdraw from here, we want to remove the rubble and live on the land."" ""After the US made Israel destroy our houses in Gaza, he is telling us that Gaza is destroyed and we have to leave?"" Ms Wadi goes on. ""If there is only one drop of blood left in our children, we won't go out of Gaza. We won't give up on it!"" Many Palestinians we spoke to called on Jordan and Egypt - which Trump is pressing to take displaced Gazans - and for Saudi Arabia - which he wants to normalise relations with Israel - to hold out against US pressure. Since its establishment, Israel has rejected the right of Palestinian refugees to return to their historic homeland, as this would have left the Jewish people as a minority within its borders. Today, there are about 5.9m Palestinians registered by the UN, with most living in Gaza, the occupied West Bank, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon. Israel has long argued that those who were dispossessed should be absorbed by Arab countries, pointing out that thousands of Jews left these to come to Israel during the regional turmoil after it became a state. Israeli officials suggest that by proposing to take over war-torn Gaza, creating a ""Riviera of the Middle East"" after resettling Palestinians elsewhere, the Trump administration is offering fresh thinking on a long-running conflict. While Trump notably did not back the re-establishment of settlements in Gaza, settler leaders have reacted enthusiastically to the idea of displacement, calling on the Israeli government to act immediately. Israel occupied Gaza and the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war and began constructing settlements in both that are widely seen as illegal under international law. In 2005, Israel withdrew its troops and settlers from Gaza, although the UN still regards it as Israeli-occupied territory. ""Assuming Trump's declarations about transferring Gazans to other countries throughout the world actualise, we need to move quickly and build settlements throughout the Gaza Strip,"" stated the Nachala settlement organisation, which claims it has hundreds of activists ready to move there. ""No part of Israel should be left unsettled by Jews. If we leave any area desolate it is liable to be overtaken by our enemies,"" Nachala added. In contrast, the Israeli anti-occupation NGO, Peace Now, dismissed the Trump plan. It backs the creation of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel as part of the long-standing international formula for peace in the region, known as the two-state solution. Peace Now said there was ""no feasible way to transfer two million Gazans"" outside. ""It's time to stop fantasising about ethnic cleansing and forced displacement in Gaza and face reality - there is only one solution that can guarantee security and stability in the Middle East: two states for two peoples and an end to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict,"" it commented. Many Israelis and Palestinians are concerned about what the latest announcements could mean for the current talks on extending the Gaza ceasefire. The next stage of the deal is meant to see the return of some 60 remaining Israeli hostages - not all of whom are alive - and a more permanent end to the fighting. However, the brother of one Israeli hostage held by Hamas told us: ""I don't take what Trump says too seriously. It's not realistic. He's shooting for the stars."" He added that this was ""like with Canada"" - referring to the US leader's suggestions that it should become his country's ""51st state"". Some Gazans did acknowledge that they felt one aspect of President Trump's declaration was based on reality - his comments that the small coastal strip has become ""unliveable"". Last month, a UN damage assessment showed that clearing over 50m tonnes of rubble left in Gaza as a result of the heavy Israeli bombardment could take 21 years and cost up to $1.2bn. Bilal al-Rantisi, a former customs worker, is in shock after arriving back in Gaza City with his wife and four children having spent more than a year displaced in the south. ""We have returned to a catastrophe, the worst in history,"" he said despondently. ""I found neither my home nor my siblings' homes were standing. Trump doesn't speak in vain. He knows that Gaza is no longer a place fit for human habitation."" He said he was hoping to sell his car and his wife's gold jewellery to raise funds. ""I will leave Gaza at the earliest possible opportunity. Yes, all Gazans oppose displacement but putting emotions aside, if people were given the chance, many would choose to leave."""

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9w5q8qn59yo,Trump's Gaza plan will be seen as flying in face of international law,2025-02-05T03:33:19.320Z,Tom Bateman,"When US President Donald Trump began speaking 10 days ago of Gaza as a demolition site, calling to ""clean out that whole thing"", it wasn't clear how far these were off-the-cuff remarks. But in the lead up to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit, in his Oval Office comments before the meeting, and in the press conference itself, it's now clear he is profoundly serious about his proposals. They amount to the most radical upending in the established US position on Israel and the Palestinians in the recent history of the conflict; and will be seen as flying in the face of international law. As well as how the announcement will be absorbed by ordinary people on the ground, it could also have a significant impact on the more immediate phased ceasefire and hostage release process, at a critical juncture. Trump and his officials are framing his call to - in his language - permanently ""resettle"" all Palestinians out of Gaza as a humanitarian gesture, saying there is no alternative for them because Gaza is a ""demolition site"". Under international law, attempts to forcibly transfer populations are strictly prohibited, and Palestinians as well as Arab nations will see this as nothing short of a clear proposal aimed at their expulsion and the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians from their land. That's why Arab leaders have already categorically rejected his ideas, made with increasing frequency over the last 10 days, when he suggested Egypt and Jordan could ""take"" Palestinians from Gaza. In a statement on Saturday, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar, the Palestinian Authority and the Arab League said that such a move could ""threaten the region's stability, risk expanding the conflict, and undermine prospects for peace and coexistence among its peoples"". It has long been a desire of the ultranationalist far right in Israel to expel Palestinians from the occupied territories and expand Jewish settlements in their place. Since the 7 October 2023 attacks on Israel, these groups – leaders of whom have been part of Netanyahu's coalition – have demanded the war against Hamas continues indefinitely, vowing ultimately to re-establish Israeli settlements in the Gaza Strip. They have continued their calls and opposed the current ceasefire and hostage release deal. In his White House press conference with the Israeli prime minister, Trump went further even than his recent growing calls for the Palestinians in Gaza to be ""relocated"" to Egypt and Jordan, saying that the United States would then take the territory over and rebuild it. When asked whether Palestinians would be allowed back, he said ""the world's people"" would live there, saying it would be an ""international, unbelievable place"", before adding ""also Palestinians"". His Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff earlier in the day summed up much of the tone around the proposal, saying of Trump ""this guy knows real estate"". Trump said it would be the ""Riviera of the Middle East"". Asked whether American troops would be involved in the take over of Gaza, Mr Trump said ""we'll do what is necessary"". His proposals amount to the most radical transformation in the US position on the territory since the creation of the state of Israel in 1948 and the war of 1967, which saw the start of Israel's military occupation of land including the Gaza Strip. Gaza was already home to Palestinians who fled or were forced from their homes in the wars surrounding Israel's creation. They and their descendants make up the vast majority of Gaza's population to this day. Trump's proposals, if enacted, would involve that population, now more than two million people, being forced elsewhere in the Arab world or even beyond, says Trump, to ""resettle… permanently"". The proposals would wipe out the possibility of a future two-state solution in any conventional sense and will be categorically rejected by Palestinians and the Arab world as an expulsion plan. Much of Netanyahu's political base and the ultranationalist settler movement in Israel will champion President Trump's words, seeing them as the fulfilment of a means as Netanyahu puts it to stop ""Gaza being a threat to Israel"". For ordinary Palestinians, it would amount to a mass act of collective punishment.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cpwxj8108kno,Palestinian gunman kills Israeli soldiers as UN warns over W Bank operation,2025-02-04T18:24:39.583Z,David Gritten,"Israel's military says two soldiers have been killed in a shooting attack in the occupied West Bank, as its forces continue a major operation against Palestinian armed groups in the north of the territory. Another eight soldiers were wounded when a Palestinian gunman opened fire at a checkpoint in Tayasir village, 2km (1.2 miles) north of Tubas, a military statement said. The attacker was shot dead, it said. Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad praised the attack as a response to the Israeli operation in Tubas, Jenin and Tulkarm, but neither said they were behind it. Meanwhile, a UN official warned the situation in Jenin's refugee camp was heading in a ""catastrophic direction"". Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced the start of a large-scale operation to ""defeat terrorism"" in Jenin on 21 January, three days after the ceasefire in the Gaza Strip took effect. The operation was expanded into Tulkarm and Tubas last week. The Palestinian health ministry says Israeli forces have killed 70 Palestinians across the West Bank, including occupied East Jerusalem, since the start of the year. The figure includes the 25 reported killed in the Jenin area and 13 in the Tubas and Tulkarm areas over the past two weeks. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) has said it killed about 55 ""terrorists"" and arrested 380 wanted individuals across the West Bank in January. Israeli media reported that the Palestinian who carried out Tuesday's shooting attack in Tayasir was able to sneak up to a military post next to the checkpoint before opening fire with an M16 rifle at soldiers stationed there. Soldiers fired back and a gun battle lasted several minutes before the attacker was killed, they said. The IDF named the two soldiers who were killed as Sgt Maj Ofer Yung, 39, and Sgt Maj Avraham Friedman, 43. Two of the eight wounded soldiers were in a serious condition in hospital, it said. During a visit to the scene later on Tuesday, the IDF's Chief of Staff, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, promised it would ""investigate and draw conclusions"" from what he described as the ""serious attack"". ""We will increase the counterterrorism activity and expand it to additional areas,"" he added. Hamas praised what it described as the ""heroic and qualitative operation carried out by a Palestinian resistance fighter"" in Tayasir, saying that it showed ""the crimes of the occupation and its aggression against the northern occupied West Bank will not go unpunished"". On Monday, Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas's spokesman alleged that the Israeli operation was part of a wider effort aimed at ""displacing citizens and ethnic cleansing"". Speaking to reporters in Geneva on Tuesday, Juliette Touma of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) warned of the deteriorating situation at Jenin refugee camp. Hundreds of Israeli security forces backed by helicopters, drones and armoured bulldozers have been carrying out raids in the camp, long seen as a stronghold of armed groups. ""Large parts of the camp were completely destroyed in a series of detonations by the Israeli forces. It is estimated that 100 houses were destroyed or heavily damaged,"" Ms Touma said. ""This detonation that happened on Sunday was when children were supposed to go back to school,"" she added. The IDF said on Sunday that it had ""dismantled"" 23 structures where explosives laboratories, weapons, observation posts and other infrastructure belonging to armed groups were located. Ms Touma also said that Unrwa, which has been unable to provide services in the camp since early December, had received no prior warning of the explosions from Israeli authorities. On Thursday, two laws passed by Israel's parliament last year which bans Unrwa activity on Israeli soil and forbids contact between Israeli officials and Unrwa employees came into force. Israeli officials accuse Unrwa of being complicit with Hamas - an allegation the agency denies. Ms Touma said the Israeli government had ""not communicated to Unrwa how they intend to implement"" the laws, and that Unrwa teams were currently ""staying and delivering"". There has been a spike in violence in the West Bank since Hamas's deadly attack on Israel on 7 October 2023 and the ensuing war in Gaza. Hundreds of Palestinians have been killed as Israeli forces have intensified their raids, saying they are trying to stem deadly Palestinian attacks on Israelis in the West Bank and Israel. Israel has built about 160 settlements housing some 700,000 Jews since it occupied the West Bank in the 1967 Middle East war. The settlements are considered illegal under international law, although Israel disputes this."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cr465233v6wo,Car bomb blast in northern Syria kills at least 20,2025-02-03T18:06:12.036Z,David Gritten,"At least 20 people, most of them women, have been killed in a car bomb attack in northern Syria, the country's presidency says. The Syria Civil Defence, also known as the White Helmets, said a car filled with explosives blew up on a main road in the southern outskirts of the city of Manbij as a flat-bed lorry carrying about 30 agricultural workers drove past. The agency had earlier put the death toll at 15, including 11 women and three girls. Another 15 women and girls were wounded, some of them critically. The presidency vowed to ensure that the perpetrators of what it described as a ""terrorist"" attack would face the ""most severe punishments"". There was no immediate claim from any armed groups for the bombing, which was the deadliest since rebel forces overthrow president Bashar al-Assad in December. The commander of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), a Kurdish-led alliance backed by the US which controls much of north-eastern Syria, condemned the attack as a ""criminal act"" that threatened the ""unity of the national fabric"". Earlier, his media chief alleged that such bombings were among the ""fundamental tactics"" used by Turkish-backed factions known as the Syrian National Army (SNA), which the SDF has been battling in the Manbij area over the past two months. The SNA did not comment on the allegation. However, the Turkey-based Syrian Islamic Council accused the SDF of being behind the blast. Monday's car bombing was the second such attack in the Manbij area in only three days. On Saturday, two children and a woman were among four people killed by an explosion on a street in the city centre, the Syria Civil Defence said. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that the blast was near an SNA military position and that nine people were killed, including several pro-Turkish fighters. As the Assad regime collapsed the SNA launched an offensive to capture territory west of the River Euphrates which the SDF had held since driving out the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) in 2016. The SNA took control of Manbij on 9 December, after fighters from the SDF-affiliated Manbij Military Council withdrew. But since then, the SDF has tried to retake the territory by launching a counter-offensive. Turkey wants to push the SDF away from its border because it views the Kurdish militia that dominates the alliance, the People's Protection Units (YPG), as a terrorist organisation. It says the YPG is an extension of the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), which has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for decades. The car bombing came amid talks between Syria's transitional government and the SDF on the militia alliance's future. The commander of the SDF, Mazloum Abdi, met President Ahmed al-Sharaa in Damascus last week, and told the Associated Press news agency on Sunday that the two sides were negotiating with the help of Western mediators. ""Our vision of Syria is a decentralized, secular and civil country based on democracy that preserves the rights of all of its components,"" he said, referring to the country's many religious and ethnic groups. When asked whether he was prepared to dissolve the SDF, Abdi said that in principle it wanted to be part of Syria's defence ministry and part of the country's defence strategy, but that the details still had to be discussed, according to AP. Sharaa, whose Islamist group led the rebel offensive which ended Assad's 24-year rule, told Turkish TV last month that he wanted Syrian Kurdish groups to disarm. ""Preventing bloodshed and treating everyone equally is our top priority. Therefore, we believe all weapons must be under state control,"" he said."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cg5ydgeqrvqo,Who are the Israeli and Thai hostages just released by Hamas?,2025-02-02T18:37:44.660Z,,"Three Israeli hostages and five Thai nationals held by Hamas in Gaza since the 7 October 2023 have been released. Agam Berger, a 20-year-old Israeli soldier, was reunited with her family at a military base in southern Israel after being handed over by armed Palestinian fighters to the Red Cross in Jabalia, northern Gaza, on Thursday. About two hours later there was another handover in the southern city of Khan Younis. Israeli civilians Arbel Yehud, 29, and Gadi Moses, 80, were pictured being escorted by fighters into a Red Cross vehicle. The Israeli military subsequently announced that they had been transferred to its forces in Gaza along with five Thai hostages and then moved to Israel. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s office named the Thai nationals as agricultural workers Pongsak Thaenna, Sathian Suwannakham, Watchara Sriaoun, Bannawat Saethao and Surasak Lamnao. Under a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, 110 Palestinians are also being released from Israeli jails in exchange for the Israeli hostages on Thursday. The release of the Thai nationals was not part of the agreement, which began on 19 January. It should see a total of 33 Israeli hostages freed in return for about 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza in Israeli jails during the first phase lasting six weeks. So far, 10 of those Israeli hostages - five civilians, including four women, and five female soldiers - have been freed. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry says. Yarden Bibas, 34, was taken hostage from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz. His family said in a statement issued after his release that he ""left his safe room to protect his family, bravely survived captivity, and returned to an unbearable reality"". His wife, Shiri, 32, and two sons, Ariel and Kfir, who were four and nine-months-old on 7 October 2023, were also captured, but they have not been released. ""A quarter of our heart has returned to us after 15 long months,"" the Bibas family said. ""There are no words to describe the relief of holding Yarden in our hands, embracing him, and hearing his voice. Yarden has returned home, but the home remains incomplete."" American-Israeli Keith Siegel, 65, is a husband, father and grandfather. Originally from North Carolina, Mr Siegel moved to Israel four decades ago. On 7 October 2023, Hamas attackers broke into Keith and his wife Aviva's home in Kibbutz Kfar Aza and dragged them away, breaking Keith's ribs and shooting him in the hand, she told the BBC. She was released from captivity in a week-long ceasefire in November 2023. After Keith's release, his family said in a statement: ""Finally, after 484 long, terrifying days and nights, full of immense worry for our father, we can breathe again."" French-Israeli Ofer Kalderon, 54, is a father of four. He was taken hostage from his home in Kibbutz Nir Oz along with two of his children, who were released in November 2023. ""Ofer is home!"" his family said in a statement. ""We are overwhelmed with joy, relief, and emotion after 484 long and difficult days of unbearable waiting. Today, we finally embrace Ofer, seeing and truly comprehending that he is here with us."" ""We have witnessed how, through extraordinary mental strength, he survived this hell. Ofer endured months in a nightmare, and we are proud of his ability to survive and hold onto the hope of embracing his children again."" ""A challenging rehabilitation period lies ahead, but we know that with our combined strength, abundant love, and a united, supportive family, we will do everything necessary to help him stand on his feet again."" Arbel Yehud, 29, was taken from her home in Nir Oz in southern Israel during the 7 October attacks. She was abducted along with her partner, Ariel Cunio. He and his brother, David Cunio, remain in captivity according to The Hostages and Missing Families Forum. Arbel's brother, Dolev Yehud, was initially believed to have been taken hostage, but was later declared dead by Israeli authorities after his remains were identified. Arbel worked at the Center for Technology, Science and Space at the Eshkol Regional Council. Following her release, Arbel's family said in a statement that they were ""overwhelmed with emotion"". ""Ahead of us lies another journey of family rehabilitation. We are a bereaved family, still aching and missing our Dolev,"" they added. They also noted that their ""mission is not yet complete"", with Ariel and David still held captive. ""We will not rest until all hostages are released,"" they said. Gadi Moses, aged 80, was also abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz where he worked as an agricultural expert. His partner, Efrat Katz, was killed in the attack. In September, his family told the Times of Israel that they had not heard any information about him since December 2023, when he appeared in a Hamas propaganda video. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said he was a founding member of his kibbutz's vineyard, and helped look after its community vegetable garden. After being reunited with his children Yair, Moran, and Oded on Thursday, Gadi was quoted as saying: ""I will do as much as I can to restore Nir Oz."" Soldier Agam Berger, 20, was kidnapped from the Nahal Oz military base on the border with Gaza. She was seen being taken away in videos released by Hamas. According to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, she was serving as an observer at the base, having arrived just two days before the 7 October attack. Pongsak, who is from Buriram province in north-eastern Thailand, was 35 years old and had been working in agriculture in Israel for more than six years when Hamas-led gunmen attacked the kibbutz where he worked, according to his father. Before he was taken hostage, Pongsak posted a live video on Facebook in which gunshots and explosions could be heard. Three days later, Pongsak's colleagues informed his father that he had been abducted with two others. His older brother was also working in Israel 15 months ago, but he was safe in the north of the country. Pongsak's father, Wilas, wept after receiving a call to say he had been released on Thursday. ""I never thought this day would come, everything has been too quiet for a while,"" he told the BBC. Sathian, from the north-eastern Thai province of Nong Bua Lamphu, was 34 when he was abducted from Kibbutz Nir Oz on 7 October 2023. His mother said he been a monk for several years after going to primary school, and that he had been working in Israel for four years before the Hamas attack. She was not sure whether Sathian had been killed or taken hostage until some of his friends who had been kidnapped from the same kibbutz were freed and returned to Thailand. Following Sathian's release, his younger sister Sirinna revealed that the family had never lost hope. ""We always believed that my brother was still alive. We never gave up. We always waited for him to come home,"" she said. Watchara is a 33-year-old father of one from Udon Thani province in north-east Thailand. Last February, Watchara's parents told BBC News Thai that he and his younger brother had been working in Israel's agricultural sector for three years before the 7 October attacks to help pay off the family's debts. As with Pongsak Thaenna, one of the brothers was based in the south and the other in the north. Watchara was working at Kibbutz Nir Oz when Hamas-led gunmen stormed across the nearby Gaza perimeter fence. His family spent a month fearing that he had been killed before they were informed by multiple sources that his name was on a list of hostages. ""The first thing I want to do is to hug my son and tell him I miss him very much,"" Watchara's mother, Wiwwaew, said on Thursday following his release. ""His daughter, Nudee, was also happy. She has been praying every day for her daddy to return."" Bannawat, from the northern Thai province of Nan, was 27 when he was kidnapped during the 7 October attack. His wife, Wichayada, said he had gone to Israel to work for nine months and taken out loans worth more than 100,000 baht ($2,970; £2,380) to pay for the travel. The youngest of their two children was only one month old when he was taken back to Gaza as a hostage. Surasak Lamnao, 32, is from Udon Thani province in north-eastern Thailand. As with Sathian Suwannakham, Surasak's mother only received confirmation that he was a hostage when a released Thai hostage told her that he was being held in captivity. Agam was taken captive alongside her fellow observers Liri Albag, Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, and Naama Levy. The other four Israeli soldiers were released by Hamas on 25 January, in a swap that saw Israel free 200 Palestinian prisoners. They were handed to the Red Cross in Gaza City in the second such exchange since the ceasefire came into effect. The first release saw three women hostages and 90 Palestinian prisoners freed on 19 January. Karina Ariev, 20, was serving at the Nahal Oz army base when she was kidnapped on 7 October, 2023. Her sister Alexandra told the BBC she heard shooting as Karina called her during the attack, and later saw a video showing Karina being taken away in a vehicle. Alexandra then saw the video circulating on Telegram of Karina's kidnapping. ""We identified her, she had blood on her face, she was screaming. ""I would never wish anyone to feel this feeling,"" she told the BBC. ""Time has stopped."" After her release, her family described her as a ""symbol of courage, heart, and determination, and we are proud of her beyond words"". ""After 477 tumultuous days of pain, worry, and endless anxiety – we finally got to embrace our beloved Karina, hear her voice, and see her smile that once again fills us with light,"" the statement read. Naama Levy, 20, was filmed being bundled into a jeep, her hands tied behind her back. The footage was released by Hamas and circulated widely on social media. According to her mother, the teenager had just begun her military service. But she had previously been part of an Israeli-Palestinian peace initiative, and her family called her ""a peace seeker"". In a video of her kidnapping from the Nahal Oz army base, she was heard to tell her captors in English: ""I have friends in Palestine."" In May 2024 her brother, Amit, said her family released the footage to ""encourage all sides to get back to the table"" to solve ""an unbearable humanitarian issue"". ""We feel like she's handling the situation like the true superhero she is, like a hero fighting for her life."" Daniella Gilboa, 20, was injured in the leg when she was kidnapped along with other female soldiers at Nahal Oz. She has been seen in several videos, and in one last year asked Israel's government why she had been ""abandoned"" and ""discarded"" while war raged around her. Ms Gilboa's mother, Orly, told the Jerusalem Post the video showed her daughter was ""strong and determined"". However, she said she was concerned about her ""poor mental state"". After her release, her family said she had ""survived 477 days in the hell of Gaza and has finally returned to our family's embrace"". ""How we've prayed for this moment!"" the statement said. The family went on to thank Israelis for their ""prayers and support during this time"", adding ""we couldn't have made it through without you"". Liri Albag was 18 and had just started military training as an Army lookout when Hamas attacked the Nahal Oz base on 7 October 2023. Her cousin Aya Albag, a corporal in the army, said she had told her she was ""proud"" of her passing her observation course before she went to the base ""She was motivated and so happy that she was assigned to Nahal Oz,"" she told the Jerusalem Post. ""She began her role on Thursday, and a day and a half later, on Saturday morning, she was kidnapped."" Her family say that she has managed to pass messages back to them through released hostages. In January 2024, footage of Albag was released by Hamas and she could be heard saying her ""entire life had been put on pause"". ""The world is starting to forget about us. No one cares about us. We're living in a nightmare."" The hostages freed on 19 January - the first under this latest ceasefire deal - were Romi Gonen, Doron Steinbrecher and Emily Damari. All three arrived back in Israel this month after being released by Hamas in Gaza, and were reunited with their families. Romi Gonen, 24, was captured as she tried to escape the Nova music festival when it was targeted by the militant group as part of the 7 October 2023 attack. More than 360 people were killed at the festival when Hamas fighters crossed over the border, 2km (1.3 miles) to the west. The desert landscape offered partygoers limited cover and exit routes were blocked by gunmen. When sirens sounded as the attack unfolded, Romi called her family. Her mother, Meirav, recalled hearing shots and shouting in Arabic in the final call with her daughter. Romi was ambushed by Hamas militants as she tried to flee. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum said Romi had gone to the festival ""to do what she loved, to dance"" - something she had studied for 12 years, starring in solo performances and becoming an ""amazing choreographer"". In a video clip shared by the Israeli military, Romi's father was seen jumping in the air before breaking down in tears as he watched footage of his daughter's release. Doron, 31, was abducted from her apartment in Kibbutz Kfar Aza - near Gaza's north-western border - when Hamas attacked. The community, one of many Israeli villages along the border, was heavily targeted by armed militants during the 7 October attacks. Israeli officials said Hamas burned homes and killed civilians, including whole families, as well as taking hostages. When the assault began, Doron contacted her family and friends via WhatsApp to say she was hiding under the bed as militants advanced, the Hostages and Missing Families Forum said. In her last voice message, she was heard screaming ""they've caught me"" as shouting and gunfire sounded in the background. Doron's family received no information about her whereabouts for nearly four months. ""After an unbearable 471 days, our beloved Dodo has finally returned to our arms,"" her family said in a statement released by the missing families forum. Emily, 28, was shot in the hand and taken into Gaza from her home during the attack, and also saw her dog shot and killed. Photographs after her release showed Emily with a bandaged hand and two missing fingers from that attack. Her mother, Mandy Damari, was also in the kibbutz in her separate home on 7 October. Mrs Damari hid in the safe room and was saved by a bullet hitting the door handle, making it impossible for attackers to get in. As the assault unfolded, Emily sent her mother a text message containing a single heart emoji - that was the last contact they had. Emotional images showed Emily reunited with her mother in Israel, hugging while on a video call with her brother. ""I want to thank everyone who never stopped fighting for Emily throughout this horrendous ordeal, and who never stopped saying her name,"" Mrs Damari said. Mrs Damari was born and raised in the UK, and met her husband on a holiday in Israel aged 20. Emily, the youngest of four children, has strong connections with the UK - she is a Tottenham Hotspur fan and would often visit to see relatives. Before the ceasefire, Israel said 94 hostages remained unaccounted for, but it believed only 60 to still be alive. There are 26 more Israeli hostages due to be handed over in the first phase of the ceasefire deal. Israel has said eight of them are dead, citing a list provided by Hamas that gave information on the status of the hostages."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5klgv5zv0o,What we know about the Gaza ceasefire deal,2025-02-02T16:53:07.765Z,Raffi Berg,"A ceasefire between Israel and Hamas is under way after 15 months of war. The deal aims to bring a permanent end to the fighting and free hostages held by Hamas in Gaza in exchange for Palestinian prisoners held by Israel. Getting to this point took months of painstaking indirect negotiations, and the timetable and complexity of the deal mean even a small incident could escalate and threaten to derail the ceasefire. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. This triggered a massive Israeli military offensive in Gaza, which has killed more than 47,000 Palestinians, the Hamas-run health ministry says. The ceasefire was announced on 15 January and began four days later, after months of negotiations led by the US, Qatar and Egypt. It is based on a proposal set out by former US President Joe Biden in May 2024. The deal will be carried out in three stages: Stage one This will last 42 days, during which: Stage two Sixteen days after the start of stage one, negotiations will begin on the second stage, during which: Stage three The final part of the agreement will see: The deal includes the release of the remaining hostages taken in October 2023, in addition to three Israelis who were abducted before the war. Israel says Hamas is holding 55 hostages who are alive and 35 who are dead. Twenty-four hostages - including female Israeli soldiers, male and female Israeli civilians, and Thai nationals - have so far been freed. They were released by Hamas in stage-managed events in different locations in Gaza, where they were handed over to the Red Cross. The Red Cross then transferred them to Israeli forces inside Gaza, before they were driven across the border into Israel and reunited with their families. The freed hostages were then flown to hospitals for medical checks. Around 1,900 Palestinian prisoners and detainees from Gaza are due to be released in the first phase of the deal. It is not known exactly how many prisoners will be exchanged each time hostages are released. As of 15 February, 1,135 prisoners have been released. Many of those released in the first exchange, and some in the following three exchanges, had never been charged and were detained without trial in Israeli prisons under what is called ""administrative detention"", a process widely criticised by human rights groups. Others had been found guilty of serious crimes, including being convicted by Israeli courts of multiple murders. A number had been serving life sentences. The released prisoners have returned to the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem, and in some cases, Gaza. Dozens were deported due to the gravity of their crimes. Israel has insisted that no-one who was involved in the 7 October attacks will be freed. The prisoners are among more than 10,000 Palestinians held by Israel (not including detainees from Gaza held by the Israeli military) who have either been convicted, or are suspected of ""security"" offences. These range from bombings and other attacks, to belonging to banned armed groups. More than 3,000 people are reported to be held under administrative detention. Under the deal, 600 lorries of aid - 50 carrying fuel - are to be allowed into Gaza every day. This number was met or exceeded on the first three days of the ceasefire. Half of the lorries will go to the north of Gaza, where aid has been hardest to deliver and food security experts have been warning of imminent famine for months in areas that were besieged by Israeli forces. By comparison, the UN says an average of 90 lorries a day entered Gaza in December 2024. About 500 lorries were allowed into the territory every day before the start of the war. Gaza is home to an estimated 2.3 million Palestinians, almost all of whom have had to leave their homes as Israel has carried out continuous strikes across the territory and issued mass evacuation orders for large residential areas. Hundreds of thousands of Gazans have begun returning home, but in many cases there is nothing to go back to, with whole streets and neighbourhoods standing in ruin. Some 60% to 70% of buildings are estimated to have been damaged or destroyed. The process is also fraught with danger, with Israeli and Hamas forces at tense standoff, risks of unexploded ordnance, and warnings from the Israeli military to civilians to stay clear of military positions. All those who were forced by Israel to leave the north are being allowed go back via specific routes, with those in vehicles required to pass through a screening process. Rebuilding Gaza will be a monumental task. Halfway through the war, the UN estimated that at that point reconstruction could cost $40bn (£33bn). It is something which is likely to take years, if not decades. The human cost of the conflict will also be felt for many years to come, with tens of thousands wounded and left with complex psychological damage."

""I have no idea how he survived,"" she tells the BBC. ""He lost so much weight."" He was given a small bowl of water to wash himself every five days and had to ask to use the toilet, she said. He moved frequently and was mostly alone, with Ms Machikawa saying ""loneliness is another form of torture"". He calculated maths problems in his head to distract himself, and walked up to 11 km (six miles) a day in a room, measuring the distance, she added. ""Even in the darkest times, he knew how to somehow lift himself,"" she said. ""The hope of reuniting with the family and worrying about us was the greatest power, was the only nutrition that he had for his soul."" Gadi was one of 18 hostages released so far this year as part of a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas, in exchange for 583 Palestinian prisoners. The ceasefire aims to end 15 months of war in Gaza, after Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing around 1,200 people and taking 251 as hostages.  Israel's military campaign in response killed more than 47,000 people in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, whose figures are seen as reliable by the UN. Now, as hostages return from more than a year in captivity, details of their conditions are emerging. Accounts of limited food, with no fresh vegetables, are similar to conditions reported by Gazans during the war. Two former hostages' family members told the BBC they came back thinner. ""We're all very, very excited to have Keith back home, but very worried to see the state that he came back to us in,"" Tal Wax, the niece of 65-year-old American-Israeli hostage Keith Siegel, who was released on Saturday, said. ""Although we can see that he is able to walk and talk we see that he has lost a lot of weight,"" she said. She heard from her cousins and Mr Siegel's wife Aviva that ""he had to endure a lot of horrible situations in captivity while still remaining the good person he is."" He is still a vegan, she added. ""Keith is very humane and he wanted to tell us he's still the same person... even after all that he's been through... He's still living up to his convictions,"" she said. ""This is just the start of his rehabilitation. We have a long way ahead of us."" Ms Machikawa said even her uncle's release was a ""terrifying"" experience. As crowds surrounded him in Gaza on Thursday, he thought it was the ""end of his life"", she said. After he was back in Israel, she was able to sleep for five hours for the first time since his capture. ""I feel like my tension is slowly melting,"" she said. On Friday, she ran to embrace her uncle in the hospital, where he gave her ""the strongest, most powerful hug"", and she let out a ""burst of tears of relief and love"". ""We understand that the uncle we know is the same one we know but even greater,"" she said, as he was talking about rehabilitation and being strong, and dreaming of returning to his fields, where he is an agricultural expert. ""Unity and family and devoting yourself for justice and a right cause are greater than anything, because I stopped my life on 7 October,"" she said. She thanked Qatar and the US for mediating the deal, and ""brave"" Red Cross workers who facilitated the releases. ""The joy is amazing"", she said, but she has mixed feelings until every hostage is back. She said ""we must eradicate terror"" and ""Israel has to secure its borders and work for a better neighbourhood and region"". ""We shall always strive to be better, to be like Gadi, to be the one that connects even in the worst times and gives the hand for the chance of better lives with everyone around us."" Few hostages freed so far this year have spoken publicly about their experiences. On Saturday, Doron Steinbrecher, who was freed two weeks ago, released a video statement. ""It will take time and it's a process - it won't end in a week or two, but I'm here thanks to you, and I'm okay,"" she said. ""I understand that everyone knows me from that terrible recording ""They caught me, they caught me, they caught me"" or as the blonde girl wearing pink"", she said. ""But I'm no longer blonde, and I won't wear pink anymore. I'm Doron, 31 years old. I'm no longer Hamas's captive, and I'm home."" To families with loved ones still in captivity, ""you are not alone"" and ""we continue to fight for you"", she added. That includes the Bibas family, who welcomed back Yarden on Saturday, but not his wife, Shiri, and two small sons, Ariel and Kfir, who were also taken hostage. Hamas had previously said they were killed in an Israeli air strike early on in the war - but they were named in a list of hostages it said in January it was willing to free. ""A quarter of our heart has returned to us after 15 long months,"" the Bibas family said in statement. ""Yarden has returned home, but the home remains incomplete."" Israeli President Isaac Herzog said his country remained ""deeply concerned"" about their fate. Another 15 hostages and around 1,300 Palestinian prisoners are still due to be released in the first six weeks of the ceasefire, which started on 19 January."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czep8kyeeyyo,Sharaa vows to pursue criminals as Syria's transitional president,2025-01-31T20:36:22.163Z,George Wright,"Syria's new president Ahmed al-Sharaa has vowed to ""pursue the criminals who shed Syrian blood and committed massacres and crimes"" in his first address to the nation since the fall of ousted leader Bashar al-Assad. Sharaa has been named president for a ""transitional period"", seven weeks after he led the rebel offensive that overthrew Assad. He committed to issuing a ""constitutional declaration"" to serve as a ""legal reference"" during the country's transition, following the suspension of the old constitution. On Wednesday, rebel military commander Hassan Abdul Ghani announced the cancellation of Syria's 2012 constitution and the dissolution of the former regime's parliament, army and security agencies, according to the Sana news agency. Sharaa began the pre-recorded speech on Thursday by saying that he would be addressing his words to all Syrian men and women, including refugees, the families of ""martyrs"" and missing people, and activists who have dedicated their lives to the struggle for a free Syria. He credited his coming to power to every Syrian who took part in the uprising and tried to make a change, and vowed to ""pursue the criminals who shed Syrian blood and committed massacres and crimes"". He also promised to hold a ""national dialogue conference"" and vowed to preserve ""civil peace"" and Syria's territorial unity. It comes after announcements were made on Wednesday during an event in Damascus attended by the commanders of factions who fought alongside the rebel alliance led by Sharaa's Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). It was entitled the ""Conference for Announcing the Victory of the Syrian Revolution"". All rebel groups which opposed Assad in the 13-year civil war would be dissolved and integrated into state institutions, Sharaa said. As president, Sharaa would form an interim legislative council to help govern until a new constitution was approved, Ghani said. In late December, Sharaa told Al Arabiya TV in an interview that it would take up to four years to hold new elections. He said an up-to-date census would be required first which ""would take time"" and that writing up a new constitution would also take up to three years to complete. Sharaa also reiterated in the interview that he planned a ""national dialogue conference"", which he said would ""bring together all components"" of Syrian society. In 2011, Assad brutally crushed a peaceful pro-democracy uprising, sparking a civil war in which more than half a million people were killed and 12 million others forced to flee their homes. HTS - a former al-Qaeda affiliate that is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, the US, the EU and the UK - previously dominated the last rebel stronghold in north-western Syria. On 8 December, as the rebels entered Damascus after routing the army and sweeping down from the north in the space of only 12 days, Assad resigned the presidency and fled to Russia. An interim government led by Mohammed al-Bashir, the former head of the rebel administration in the north-west, has been tasked with running the country until March. Also on Wednesday, the Syrian government called on Russia to address ""past mistakes"" by paying war reparations, during the first visit by a top Kremlin delegation since the fall of Assad, its staunch ally. Sharaa and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Bogdanov discussed ""rebuilding trust with the Syrian people through concrete measures such as compensation, reconstruction and recovery"", Sana reported. The Russian foreign ministry said its delegation expressed ""unwavering support"" for Syria's unity and readiness to assist its recovery from the civil war. The Russian military carried out tens of thousands of air strikes on rebel-held areas after intervening in the conflict in support of Assad in 2015. A UK-based monitoring group says more than 21,000 people, including 8,700 civilians, were killed by those strikes and other Russian operations. Since the fall of the Assad regime, Russia has been withdrawing troops and weapons from its two bases on Syria's Mediterranean coast - Hmeimim airbase near Latakia and the naval base in Tartous. Recent satellite photos analysed by BBC Verify showed that two Russian warships were docked at Tartous, which experts said suggested an evacuation of the facility had begun. However, Russia is believed to be seeking to retain both bases, which give it a strategically important foothold in the eastern Mediterranean. Following the Russian delegation's visit to Damascus, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters in Moscow: ""That was an important trip, and the contacts were important, too, because it is necessary to establish and maintain a constant dialogue with Syria."" When asked about reports that the Syrian government had requested Assad's extradition and war reparations in return, he replied: ""I leave this without any comments. We will continue further dialogue with the Syrian authorities."" In the interview with Al Arabiya, Sharaa noted the ""deep strategic interests between Russia and Syria"" and said he did not want Russia to leave ""in a way that undermines its relationship with our country"". ""All of Syria's arms are of Russian origin, and many power plants are managed by Russian experts,"" he added. Additional reporting by Lina Sinjab in Damascus"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cj91ygv803xo,British-Israeli hostage says Hamas held her at UN facilities,2025-01-31T20:15:09.423Z,Robert Greenall,"A British-Israeli woman who was held hostage by Hamas in Gaza for 15 months says she was detained for some time at United Nations facilities. During a phone call with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, Emily Damari - who was released earlier this month - said she was held at sites belonging to the UN's agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa). She also said she was denied medical treatment during her captivity, despite being shot in the hand and leg. In a statement, Unrwa said claims that hostages had been held on UN premises were ""very serious"" and that it had repeatedly called for independent investigations into claims Palestinian armed groups, including Hamas, were misusing the facilities. Israel has repeatedly accused personnel from Unrwa of being involved in the 7 October attacks and said that its buildings in Gaza were used by Hamas. The Israeli government plans to ban the organisation from operating. During the call with Downing Street, Ms Damari said that while being held at an Unrwa facility, her captors only provided her with an out-of-date bottle of iodine to treat gunshot wounds in her leg and her left hand, on which she lost two fingers. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's PM programme, Unrwa's director of communications Juliette Touma was asked about Ms Damari's claims. She said: ""For many, many months we did not have access to several of our facilities. ""So the vast majority of our buildings were turned into shelters when the war started. ""At some point we had a million people in those shelters."" A Downing Street spokesperson said they ""welcome the fact that Unrwa have said there should be an investigation into the use of their facilities"". Ms Damari, now 28, also used the call with Sir Keir to thank people in the UK who campaigned for her release. A ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas will see the gradual release of hostages being held in Gaza, in exchange for Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons. Three more hostages are set to be released on Saturday, while 183 Palestinian prisoners are expected to be freed. Some 251 hostages were taken by Hamas when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people. The attack triggered a war which has devastated Gaza. Israel's 15-month military offensive killed 47,460 Palestinians in the territory, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8d9r0vg6v7o,Ahmed al-Sharaa named Syria's transitional president,2025-01-31T14:58:12.406Z,David Gritten,"Syria's de facto leader Ahmed al-Sharaa has been named president for the ""transitional period"", state media report, seven weeks after he led the rebel offensive that overthrew Bashar al-Assad. Rebel military commander Hassan Abdul Ghani also announced the cancellation of Syria's 2012 constitution and the dissolution of the former regime's parliament, army and security agencies, according to the Sana news agency. As president, Sharaa would form an interim legislative council to help govern until a new constitution was approved, he said. All rebel groups which opposed Assad in the 13-year civil war would be dissolved and integrated into state institutions, he added. The announcements came during a event in Damascus on Wednesday attended by the commanders of factions who fought alongside the rebel alliance led by Sharaa's Islamist group, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS). It was entitled the ""Conference for Announcing the Victory of the Syrian Revolution"". Addressing the commanders wearing military uniform, Sharaa stressed that Syria's new leadership faced a ""heavy task and a great responsibility"". He said the first priority was to ""fill the power vacuum in a legitimate and legal way"". Secondly, he added, civil peace should be maintained by ""seeking transitional justice and preventing revenge attacks"". He also called for state institutions, particularly the military, security agencies and police, and economic infrastructure to be rebuilt. In late December, Sharaa told Al Arabiya TV in an interview that it would take up to four years to hold new elections. He said an up-to-date census would be required first which ""would take time"" and that writing up a new constitution would also take up to three years to complete. Sharaa also reiterated in the interview that he planned a ""national dialogue conference"", which he said would ""bring together all components"" of Syrian society. In 2011, Assad brutally crushed a peaceful pro-democracy uprising, sparking a civil war in which more than half a million people were killed and 12 million others forced to flee their homes. HTS - a former al-Qaeda affiliate that is still designated as a terrorist organisation by the UN, the US, the EU and the UK - previously dominated the last rebel stronghold in north-western Syria. On 8 December, as the rebels entered Damascus after routing the army and sweeping down from the north in the space of only 12 days, Assad resigned the presidency and fled to Russia. An interim government led by Mohammed al-Bashir, the former head of the rebel administration in the north-west, has been tasked with running the country until March.

https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cvgp11nj8gno,"Father of youngest hostage among three men to be released on Saturday, Hamas says",2025-01-31T14:14:31.441Z,Raffi Berg,"The Palestinian armed group Hamas has released the names of three hostages it says it will free on Saturday under the ceasefire deal with Israel. They are Israelis Ofer Kalderon, 54, and Yarden Bibas, 34, and American-Israeli Keith Siegel, 65. Mr Bibas is the father of Kfir, the youngest hostage who was 10 months old when he was kidnapped by Hamas. His wife Shiri and their other son Ariel, four, were also captured. The Israeli prime minister's office said Israel had received the list of hostages. Israel will release another batch of Palestinian prisoners in return. It will mark the fourth such exchange of hostages for prisoners since the ceasefire came into effect on 19 January. Some 251 hostages were taken by Hamas when it attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, killing about 1,200 people. The attack triggered a war which has devastated Gaza. Israel's 15-month military offensive killed 47,460 Palestinians in the territory, according to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry. Ofer Kalderon and Yarden Bibas were taken by Hamas from Nir Oz, while Keith Siegel was taken from Kfar Aza. Mr Bibas' wife Shiri, and their two children, Ariel, now five, and Kfir, now two, were also taken captive. Their fate is unknown. Their release will bring the number of hostages freed under the ceasefire deal so far to 18. On Saturday, 183 Palestinian prisoners are expected to be released. The Palestinian Prisoners' Club said 111 people detained after 7 October 2023 would be among them. Four hundred Palestinian prisoners - ranging from those serving long sentences for bombings and other attacks to teenagers held without charge - have so far been freed in exchange. Most have returned to the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and Gaza, while many of the most serious offenders have been deported. The most recent exchange, which took place on Thursday, demonstrated the precariousness of the arrangement. Israel briefly delayed letting the prisoners go after it was outraged by the way eight hostages were treated as they were released. As seven of the eight were freed in Khan Younis, crowds of spectators - many taking pictures with mobile phones - pushed in as the captives were led by gunmen to Red Cross vehicles before being transferred to Israel. In a separate release, in Jabaliya, an eighth was led out through a scene of rubble from Israeli air strikes in a stage-managed event and put on a platform before being handed over to the Red Cross. The Israeli prime minister's office later said it had since received from mediators ""a commitment that a safe exit will be guaranteed for our hostages"" yet to be released. Meanwhile UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer has told former British-Israeli hostage Emily Damari that he was ""overjoyed"" at seeing her released, according to a statement issued by a spokesperson for the Damari family. In a phone call with Mr Starmer on Friday morning, Emily - who was freed on 19 January - and her mother thanked the prime minister and everyone who had campaigned for her release, the statement said. It said that the Damaris revealed to the prime minister that Emily had been held for a time in facilities belonging to the main UN agency for Palestinian refugees, Unrwa, and that she had been denied medical treatment. They called on Mr Starmer to put ""maximum pressure"" on Hamas and Unrwa to allow the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit the hostages still being held in Gaza, the statement added."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c334m4xl72mo,Palestinian born after father was jailed hugs him for first time,2025-01-31T04:20:36.663Z,Wyre Davies,"After a delay of several hours, there were jubilant scenes here in Ramallah where around 60 Palestinian prisoners were freed from Israeli detention into the arms of their overjoyed loved ones. Among those released and tasting freedom for the first time in 22 years was 47-year-old Hussain Nassar, who was arrested in 2003 for taking part in the second Palestinian Intifada, or uprising. There to meet him were his daughters, 22-year-old Hedaya and Raghad, who's 21. Both were dressed in the striking traditional red and black dresses from Nablus, their hometown. The younger daughter had earlier told me that it was impossible to describe living for so long without her dad. ""This is the first time I will touch him. I will hug him. I cannot express my feelings."" Almost shaking with the excitement of meeting her father, she said ""the Israelis arrested him when my mum was pregnant with me. I feel like this is the first time I will know what it's like to have a father!"" Among the 110 Palestinian prisoners released at this stage of what is still a fragile ceasefire, were several women and children - the youngest of them 15 years old. Some of them were accused of relatively minor offences, others had not been convicted or formally charged. But 21 prisoners convicted of the most serious offences, including murder, were not allowed by Israel to return home to the Palestinian Territories and were exiled to Egypt or neighbouring countries. One senior figure who was not sent into exile, despite being convicted for his involvement in the deaths of several Israelis, was Zakaria Zubeidi. The former commander in the al-Aqsa Martyrs' Brigades was one of several detainees carried aloft by jubilant supporters through the streets near Ramallah's civic centre. It was a scene, like the earlier Hamas show of strength in Gaza, that will irk many Israelis and undoubtedly lead to renewed calls from some right-wing politicians for the war against Hamas in Gaza to resume after this initial six-week phase of the ceasefire is over. For the governor of Ramallah and El Bireh, Dr Leila Abu Ghanam, this homecoming for so many former prisoners was an occasion to celebrate. But she had mixed emotions as Israeli military operations intensify in the northern part of the occupied West Bank, and the Gaza ceasefire is still under strain. ""All Palestinians are happy about the release of the prisoners but we're sad about what is happening in the provinces at this very moment. Mothers today, despite how happy they are for the release of their children, are also sad for those mothers who have lost their homes and children."" Today was one of very few days, while covering this intractable conflict, that I've seen so many happy faces among both Palestinians and Israelis. It has been a terrible, destructive war that has shattered so many lives. Governor Ghanam accused the Israeli government of not being interested in peace. ""But we don't lose hope,"" she said, smiling. ""If we had lost hope, Palestinians would have ended 75 years ago."" The next batch of prisoner releases in exchange for Israeli hostages should happen on Saturday."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cglyg1wdee3o,Inside an Islamic State camp shaken by US aid cuts,2025-01-30T11:40:11.768Z,Jiyar Gol,"Reverberations are being felt around the world after it emerged that US President Donald Trump was pausing American foreign aid. Among the countries in an uncertain position is Syria, where authorities face an uphill struggle to secure camps and prisons after conflict. From a distance, al-Hol camp looks like a tent city. In 2019, after the defeat of Islamic State (IS) militants, about 40,000 IS family members were housed in this camp in the Kurdish-controlled region of north-eastern Syria. Most of the residents of the camp are women and children. It is so vast that it has its own bazaar and a clinic with a maternity unit. Iraqi and Syrian Kurdish authorities fear it has become a breeding ground for IS. There are thought to be about 4,500 IS militants, including foreign fighters, held in prisons in this Kurdish-controlled region. US President Donald Trump's decision to cut aid could make it harder for the Kurdish authorities to provide food, pay guards and ensure the security of both the camps and the prisons. Friday's news that the US Department of State had issued a halt to nearly all existing foreign assistance, and paused new aid, prompted a few turbulent days at al-Hol, before operations resumed on Tuesday. Jihan Hana is the camp manager, a Kurdish woman in her 40s. Speaking to the BBC on Tuesday, she explained that her team relied heavily on non-governmental organisations (NGOs) to provide for the camp's residents - and that some NGOs received up to 70% of their funding from the US. ""Today until 2pm, we didn't even have bread delivery scheduled,"" she said. ""An NGO that co-ordinates the return of Iraqis from the camp halted its operations because it couldn't pay the guards. The NGO sent its civilian employees home and, as a result, the return of over 500 Iraqis has been delayed."" The fear of reduced aid poses a significant security threat for al-Hol. The NGOs depend on foreign funding to pay guards and maintain order. Entry into the camp is only permitted under armed security escort because of the volatile conditions. A State Department statement did not comment directly on events at the camp but said the review of foreign aid spending was necessary. ""National security is and will remain a top priority. The review period is a measure put in place for us to align our ongoing work with the America First agenda.""  We first visited the section of the camp designated for Iraqi and Syrian nationals. Men, women and children all reside here. Many of the children were born here. The importance of the camp is highlighted by the fact that many of its inhabitants are afraid to leave to return home. Maria, a 19-year-old Iraqi girl dressed in black with only her eyes visible, said she was 12 when she arrived at the camp. ""My father is in prison and I don't know where he is held,"" she said. When asked if she wanted to return home, she shook her head and tears came to her eyes. ""I am afraid of revenge."" When IS took over cities in Syria and Iraq, they killed many tribal and community leaders. Many IS family members have their own fears of imprisonment by their governments, or of retaliation from local communities. Last week, Kurdish authorities offered to allow all of the camp's 16,000 Syrian nationals to voluntarily return home. Some have already left. But many of them, like Abu Ebrahim - a Syrian from Hama - said he feared facing retribution. ""I don't feel safe, I prefer to stay here for now,"" he said. Sleeper cells for IS are reportedly active within the camp, and many inhabitants fear repercussions for speaking out. Others still believe in the IS ideology. There is always fear of detainees escaping - a fear that has not been assuaged by the possibility of an aid cut. The foreign section houses families of IS members from more than 40 nationalities - including Europeans, Americans and families from former Soviet states. Camp manager Jihan Hana described this section as housing the most devoted supporters of IS ideology. Entry requires an armoured vehicle and heightened security. Our guide Diana, a Kurdish security officer, explained that this section was composed solely of women and children. ""They are highly organised,"" she said. ""They have their own secret police and secret courts, and violators of IS rules are punished. Boys over the age of 13 are separated from their families and taken to deradicalisation programmes.""  The camp's policy of separating boys at the age of 13 has drawn criticism from human rights groups, but was defended by Jihan Hana, who cited security concerns. ""The boys can cause significant problems. There have been uprisings where sections of the camp were set on fire and anyone entering was attacked."" During an interview with a woman from Tajikistan, children surrounded us. When I tried to interact with them by offering a high five or handshake, they spat, kicked and threw stones at us. Some raised the IS one-finger salute, shouting ""Allahu Akbar"", which means ""God is Great"". Gen Mazloum Abdi, commander of the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), told the BBC the conflict in northern Syria - where Turkish-backed Islamist militias have intensified attacks against the Kurds - has further strained resources. ""Turkey's aim is to attack Kobane. If the fighting continues, we will have to redeploy forces to the front lines. This would create a security vacuum, potentially enabling Isis sleeper cells to stage attacks on camps and prisons to free their family members and militants from detention."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cy5kqqv56g1o,Inside the operation to bring Israel's hostages home from Gaza,2025-01-29T18:19:41.571Z,Alice Cuddy,"It begins with a phone call with a location. Once the details are received, a team from the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) sets off in vehicles marked with the humanitarian organisation's logo to pick up the hostages in Gaza. Israeli military and medical personnel are also assembled at several different locations, waiting to bring them home. The hostage releases, watched around the world, come after months of tense negotiations aimed at ending a war that began on 7 October 2023, when Hamas fighters killed some 1,200 people in Israel and kidnapped 251 others. In the 15 months that followed, more than 47,000 Palestinians were killed in Gaza, according to the Hamas-run health ministry, and many more lost their homes in Israeli bombardments. Under the terms of the ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas that began on 19 January, a total of 33 Israeli hostages are due to be released and returned to their families during the first phase, lasting six weeks. In exchange, hundreds of Palestinian prisoners in Israeli jails are being freed. If anything goes wrong, it risks the hostages remaining in captivity, and reigniting the war. ""This is more than just a drive,"" says ICRC spokesperson Sarah Davies. ""These operations may seem simple, but in fact they are very complex and require rigorous security measures to minimise the risks to those involved."" The ICRC, which acts as a neutral intermediary in the handover, assembles a team of specialists, some of whom have been involved in similar operations in the past - though this is more challenging than most. There are some details that the group cannot speak about publicly because of concerns that it could compromise the security of the operation. Ms Davies says planning is crucial to ensuring that the exchange runs smoothly. They have mapped out alternative routes to get to different locations in Gaza, knowing that the ""safest route can change"" at any time. Among their biggest concerns are the dangers posed by unexploded ordnance, destroyed and damaged infrastructure, and large crowds with ""heightened emotions"". ""Our teams prepare and plan for as many scenarios as possible,"" she says. ""The most important thing for us is to be able to return any person entrusted to our care safely back to their homes."" But it is impossible to plan for everything. ""From previous experience, here and in other places around the world, we know that the logistics and final details can change at any time, even – and particularly – during operations themselves,"" says Ms Davies. Medical staff and so-called weapons contamination specialists, trained in identifying explosive remnants of war, travel with the teams. During the operations, ICRC representatives also maintain regular contact with both Israeli officials and Hamas, as well as mediators. In the previous releases, Hamas has circulated the names of the released hostages in advance on its Telegram channels, without revealing exactly where the handovers will happen. The first public signs of the locations have been the presence of armed and masked members of Hamas's military wing. ""I found out from a kiosk guy that there was something happening at the junction and that al-Qassam fighters were having a parade,"" a local journalist says of the first release in Gaza City earlier this month. Crowds started gathering to watch as the fighters assembled in formation, and word began to spread that the first three hostages released under the ceasefire deal would appear there. ""When people realised this would be the place where they would hand over the Israeli hostages, people started chanting [for al-Qassam and senior Hamas figures],"" he says. ""They started shouting 'God is greatest' - that showed how joyful they were."" The journalist was also there for the second release - at a different location in Gaza City - the following week, which he describes as being ""more organised"". The fighters set up a small stage area with a desk and chairs, and stood in formation to separate the hostages from the crowds. White cars with blacked out windows were used to bring the hostages - four women soldiers - to the area. The young women were filmed thanking their captors and being handed gift bags in a video published by Hamas' military wing. They were brought on to the stage and waved at the cheering crowd, before being handed over to the care of the ICRC. Hamas spokesman Abdul Latif al-Qanou said in a later statement that the ""scenes and details"" of the staged handover ""tell the story of resistance creativity, heroism, and reinforce a model of pride and dignity"". Ms Davies says there are some aspects of the handover that are ""out of our control"". ""At all times, ICRC staff do their utmost to protect the dignity of those being released, but… it is important that people recognise the limitations of what we can do,"" she says. ""Our priority remains the safe and successful release and transfer of those in our care."" The hostages are transferred to the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) on the outskirts of Gaza. Col Dr Avi Banov, deputy chief of the Israel Defense Forces medical corps, says: ""We're prepared through the outskirts of Gaza and other areas to receive the hostages. ""We always prepare because Hamas does not tell us, 'OK, we're going to free them in this area or in that area'."" Across the border, reception points have been set up to receive them. On site are military and medical personnel, social workers and the hostages' families. A former Israeli army medic who was involved in the first hostage return operation during the November 2023 ceasefire remembers waiting next to an ambulance at a base near the border. His was one of several teams on standby in case one of the hostages had a medical emergency and says there were strict instructions about how to interact with those who returned. He recalls: ""We were told if you evacuate them, don't ask them questions, don't do anything inappropriate, just be quiet and then if the hostages asks you something or want something, of course you're going to answer and give it to them. But be low key."" He says the atmosphere at the base was one of excitement and nerves. ""It was a very important mission,"" he says. Col Dr Banov says the return begins with an introduction between the hostages and medical staff. The returned hostages are assigned a physician, a nurse and a social worker who ""accompany them all the way through"" to them being taken to hospital. Families are advised to give the hostages ""a little bit of time"" with the medical teams before the reunion to allow them to ""breathe and understand that [they're] in a safe place again"". ""We start with vitamins, something small to eat and drink, and then the families,"" Col Dr Banov says. As part of a ""grounding"" process, he says, efforts are made to give the released hostages agency to make their own decisions, with questions like: ""Would you like to take a shower before or after you meet your parents?"" Of the first seven hostages to be released, he says most had ""some sort of shrapnel injuries"" as well as suffering from malnutrition and metabolic problems. ""They're not good physically, mentally it's a very complicated issue,"" he says. In the coming weeks, he notes, the bodies of dead hostages will also arrive, with plans in place to transfer them to a forensic laboratory before funerals in Israel. After receiving initial treatment at the reception point, the surviving hostages are transferred in a ""specially adapted"" helicopter to a hospital elsewhere in the country. Col Dr Banov says: ""We tell them… we will take a helicopter back home. And then, if you're willing to, we're going to start talking about what you have been through."" It is there that the proper recovery process begins."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c0e4zv94jvqo,'Half our house is gone': Palestinians face worst fears in north Gaza,2025-01-28T16:30:28.857Z,Alice Cuddy,"Adham Batrawi had hoped for the best when he set off back to his family home in the north of Gaza after more than a year - but he was shocked at what he found. ""Half our house is gone,"" the 31-year-old told the BBC from the ruins of where he used to live in the northern city of al-Zahra. ""It looks like it was bulldozed - the living room is gone, the kitchen is gone, most of it is gone. The only thing remaining is two rooms and one bathroom... If I leave now they might be looted,"" he said. Adham is one of the hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who have made it back to the north since Israel allowed displaced residents to start to return on Monday. The return is a result of the ceasefire deal between Hamas and Israel that is aimed at permanently ending the war that began when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. A United Nations official told the BBC there was a ""massive, massive effort ahead"" to ensure that key services were provided to those returning north. One man who had returned to his home in Jabalia told the BBC it was ""not possible to describe"" the destruction around him. ""You're speaking to me while I'm clearing a space to put up a tent... We are trying to manage ourselves and find a way to live here,"" 48-year-old Imad Ali al-Zain said over the phone. ""I was happy and chanting on the way back, but when I reached my home I was disappointed because of the disastrous scene in front of me. I wished I'd never come."" The UN estimates that about 70% of the Gaza Strip's buildings have been damaged or destroyed since October 2023, with much of the worst destruction in the north. Sam Rose, acting director of the UN agency for Palestinian refugees (Unrwa) in Gaza, told the BBC the population in northern Gaza would likely ""be doubling in the next few days"". ""What they're going back to, many of them, are scenes of complete devastation. They know before they travel that their homes are likely to be destroyed or severely damaged, but they want to go home anyway,"" he said. ""Since the ceasefire came into effect a week ago, basic aid supplies have been coming in, so we're able to provide food, some water, basic shelter supplies, some monitoring of particularly vulnerable cases. But it's a massive, massive effort ahead of us."" Many more people are preparing to make the journey from south to north in the coming days, by foot or vehicle. Ihab Qraqeh, a telecoms worker who has been displaced since mid-October 2023, said he had waited to see how the first day of the return unfolded before setting off himself. ""We sent some of our family members yesterday and now we are planning to go. We are waiting for the car to come so we can start packing and go,"" he said. A man the BBC had spoken to on Monday who was preparing for the journey with his heavily pregnant wife said they had set off but turned back around. ""It was too difficult for us. I was afraid that she would suffer complications. She's eight months pregnant. So we came back [to wait at a relative's home in central Gaza],"" said Khalil Shabeer, 32. ""Even using a car, the road feels infinite - the line of cars is endless when you look at it."" Additional reporting by Muath al-Khatib"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c627z92xz6lo,BBC travels with first Jordanian helicopter delivering aid inside Gaza,2025-01-28T13:48:04.114Z,Fergal Keane,"Jordanian helicopters have begun deliveries of aid to Gaza - the first since the ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was declared. The scene from the air reveals itself out of the midday haze - grey ruins and a lifeless landscape. As we land, the Jordanian air force men jump out first and make sure there is someone from the World Food Programme to receive the aid. A solitary figure in a hi-vis jacket approaches. Next to a barbed wire fence two trucks are waiting to bring the aid into nearby Khan Younis. There are no formalities. The aid is quickly unloaded. All the time the helicopter rotors keep turning. There is a sense of real urgency - there are 14 more helicopters waiting to follow us to the landing zone. The BBC was allowed to join the mission, which landed in Israeli-held territory in southern Gaza between the Israeli border and the town of Wadi al-Salqa. Although this is just the edge of the conflict zone, the area next to the landing strip resembles a wasteland after 15 months of war. I saw what appeared to be Israeli digging machines working in the area. The Jordanians deployed 16 helicopters for Tuesday's operation. They are delivering medical supplies and baby formula which could spoil if transported on a long road journey. The Jordanian government's official spokesman, Dr Mohammad al-Momani, told me the scenes of human suffering in Gaza were ""horrific... and inhumane"".

For Gazans displaced for the 15 months, the distance is not far – the Gaza Strip is a tiny place – but today's journey is just the start of a desperately uncertain future for this war-ravaged place. The scale of the looming humanitarian challenge is hard to comprehend. ""There are no facilities, no services, no electricity, no water, no infrastructure,"" Gazan journalist Ghada el-Kurd said, as she prepared to make her own way back north from Deir el-Balah, where she's been sheltering for months. ""We have to re-establish again from the beginning, from zero."" The immediate needs – food and shelter – are starting to be addressed. ""Aid is flowing at levels we've not seen since the start of the conflict,"" Sam Rose from the UN's Palestinian refugee agency, Unrwa, said. ""So we're able to meet the bare minimums in terms of food, water, blankets, hygiene items. But beyond that, this is a long, long road."" Finding shelter in the apocalyptic ruins of Gaza is going to be the first of many huge, long-term challenges. As many as 700,000 people fled from Gaza City and the surrounding areas during the early weeks of the war. An unknown number, perhaps as many as 400,000, stayed put. Some of the areas left behind were obliterated, while others have just about survived. The UN estimates that around 70% of the Gaza Strip's buildings have been damaged or destroyed since October 2023, with much of the worst destruction in the north. Jabaliya, home to a pre-war population of 200,000, about half of whom lived in one of Gaza's oldest and biggest refugee camps, has been virtually destroyed. It is clear that for many people, the days of living in a tent are far from over. Gaza's Hamas-run Government Media Office has put out an urgent appeal for 135,000 tents and caravans. The UN says it's now able to bring in 20,000 tents that have been stuck on the border since August, along with large quantities of tarpaulin and mattresses. But it says it's going to struggle to meet the sudden demand for shelter. ""There simply aren't that many manufactured tents for aid operations anywhere in in the world,"" Mr Rose said. People who have managed to stay in the north throughout the war fear that pressure for accommodation, already acute, will get worse as civilians return and look to move back into homes abandoned over a year ago. ""There's a huge problem because people used to stay in houses of relatives or friends who are in the south,"" says Asmaa Tayeh, whose family had to flee Jabaliya but never left the north. ""Now they have to empty these houses and give them back to their owners. So a new kind of displacement has started."" Asmaa says four families are already living in her building with three more expected soon. The lack of space and privacy, she says, have already led to tensions. The return of refugees is having other knock-on effects. ""I went to the market today to buy frozen fish for the first time,"" Asmaa says. ""But already sellers are raising prices."" Pressure on already scarce water and electricity supplies is also expected to increase. But for all the widely anticipated hardships, those returning speak, sometimes in widely optimistic terms, of their relief and sense of expectation. ""We are overjoyed to return to the north, where we can finally find comfort,"" one woman told the BBC. ""Leaving behind the suffering we endured in the south and returning to the dignity of Beit Hanoun."" According to recent accounts from Beit Hanoun - in the far north-eastern corner of the Gaza Strip, close to the border with Israel - the town is unrecognisable. What of Donald Trump's suggestion that people should move, temporarily or permanently, to Egypt or Jordan? Egyptian and Jordanian officials were quick to condemn the suggestion. Both countries fear the social and security implications of a sudden influx of traumatised refugees. ""Jordan is for Jordanians and Palestine is for Palestinians,"" Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said. His country is already home to 2.4 million registered Palestinian refugees. Among Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's far-right cabinet colleagues, President Trump's suggestion received an enthusiastic welcome. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, who favours Israeli annexation and settlement of the Gaza Strip, called it ""a great idea"". Last year, speaking at a conference of supporters, he talked of creating ""a situation where Gaza's population will be reduced to half its current size in two years"". Unless Gaza is quickly rehabilitated and Gazans are given a glimpse of a better future, Smotrich may have his way. ""I think for the first few months, they will see what will happen,"" journalist Ghada el-Kurd says. ""If they lost everything and the reconstruction process is delayed, I think people will not stay in Gaza."" Around 150,000 people have already left since the war began in October 2023. Ghada says she expects others who can afford it to follow, seeking futures in the Arab world or beyond, while the poorest and most vulnerable are left behind. ""I agree with Trump that people deserve a better life,"" she says. ""But why not in Gaza?"""
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c1dgqn7nq0no,'My home is no longer there': Palestinians return to north Gaza,2025-01-27T16:25:54.282Z,Alice Cuddy and Rushdi Abualouf,"Moments after returning to her home in an affluent neighbourhood in northern Gaza, 44-year-old Sabrine Zanoun said she was overwhelmed with the mix of emotions. ""We are happy to see our family again… [but] it is also so sad it makes you cry - the destroyed houses, the rubble,"" she told the BBC. ""People would come here just to walk because of the beautiful scenery. Now it's mostly ruins."" Sabrine was one of hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians to return to their homes, or the ruins in their place, in northern Gaza on Monday. The mass return comes a week into a ceasefire deal between Israel and Hamas aimed at permanently ending a war that began more than 15 months ago. Like others in Gaza, she had been displaced several times over the course of the war, but most recently in the central city of Deir al-Balah. She joined a ""flood of people"" who travelled by foot along the coastal al-Rashid Street - a route that opened to displaced Gazans early on Monday morning. One security official in Gaza told AFP news agency that more than 200,000 people had crossed to the north of the strip by foot in a two-hour period. Palestinians spoke to the BBC while making the journey. ""It was so long and tiring,"" said 23-year-old Esraa Shaheen, shortly after reaching Gaza City. ""Until the middle of the road, people were happy and singing and stuff like that, but then when it was taking a long time people were getting frustrated. Then we reached a sign that said 'Welcome to Gaza' and a lot of Palestinian flags and people began to feel joy again,"" she said. Others made the journey by car along a different route. ""There are thousands of people here. They're filling the entire road… we are very happy but I am also feeling sad that I know I will reach Gaza City but my home is no longer there,"" 42-year-old Wafaa Hassouna said on the phone as she neared the checkpoint. When people reached their destinations, they spoke of their shock at what remained standing in their communities. Mohammed Imad Al-Din, a barber who had been waiting at the checkpoint, returned to find his home destroyed, and his salon looted and damaged by a nearby Israeli strike. Lubna Nassar had been waiting with her two daughters and son to be reunited with her husband. But while he had survived, their home was gone. ""The warmth of reunion was overshadowed by the bitter reality - we no longer have a home so we moved from a tent in the south to a tent in the north,"" she said. Others are still waiting to make the journeys home or deciding on their next steps. One man said he would have ""run to the north like I was in a race"" if he did not have his pregnant wife and young daughter with him. Instead, they were hoping for the large crowds to pass, and to set off slowly on their journey home. He said they expected to find much of their neighbourhood flattened. ""We hope that this war will end and we'll rebuild everything that is destroyed,"" he said. Another said his brother had told him not to return for now. He ""called and said… the houses are demolished to the ground. People are sleeping on the streets and nobody is helping them."" In the affluent neighbourhood of Tel al-Hawa, Sabrine said she was grateful to be back with her family and in a home that was still standing. ""It's mostly ruins and destruction. Anyone who finds his house still standing, or even just a room, should consider himself lucky,"" she said. Additional reporting by Muath Al-Khatib"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx25x2lvk7ro,Lebanon ceasefire deal extended as initial deadline passes,2025-01-27T01:55:22.278Z,Ian Aikman,"The US and Lebanon say the ceasefire deal with Israel - which had been due to expire on Sunday - has been extended until mid-February. Israel had kept troops deployed in Lebanon beyond the initial deadline, accusing the Lebanese government of not fully implementing its part of the deal, which required the removal of Hezbollah from the area. On Sunday, the Lebanese health ministry said Israeli soldiers killed 22 people and wounded 124 others who were trying to return to their homes in the country's south. Lebanon's Prime Minister Najib Mikati says, following contact from the US, the truce will now remain in place until 18 February. The initial ceasefire plan, announced in late November, brought an end to 14 months of conflict between Israel and the Lebanese armed group Hezbollah. Brokered by the US and France, the agreement gave Hezbollah 60 days to end its armed presence in southern Lebanon and required Israeli forces to withdraw over the same period. Announcing the plan, then-US President Joe Biden said it was ""designed to be a permanent cessation of hostilities"" between the two sides. But on Friday, with two days to go before the deadline, Israel said some soldiers would remain in the region as the ceasefire agreement was ""yet to be fully enforced by the Lebanese state"". A White House statement on Sunday said the deadline has now been moved to 18 February, and that negotiations will begin for the return of Lebanese prisoners captured after 7 October 2023. Thousands of Lebanese residents have returned to towns and villages near the border since the deal was agreed, despite warnings that the region was still unsafe. On Sunday, the Lebanese health ministry said 22 people had been killed by Israeli soldiers in the area. The Israeli military said it had fired ""warning shots in multiple areas"", without specifying if people had been hit, and apprehended several people it claimed posed an ""imminent threat"". The longstanding conflict between Israel and Hezbollah - an Iranian-backed militant, political and social movement - escalated last September. This lead to an intense Israeli air campaign across Lebanon, a ground invasion of the country's south, and the assassination of Hezbollah's senior leaders. The offensive killed around 4,000 people in Lebanon - including many civilians - and led more than 1.2 million residents to be displaced. Israel's stated goal was to allow the return of around 60,000 residents who had fled from communities in the country's north because of Hezbollah's attacks, and to remove the group from areas along the border. Hezbollah launched its campaign the day after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czeprnw4repo,Lebanon says 22 killed by Israeli forces after withdrawal deadline missed,2025-01-26T19:45:37.890Z,Hugo Bachega,"Israeli soldiers have killed 22 people and wounded 124 in southern Lebanon, the health ministry says, as the Israeli military remained deployed past a deadline for their withdrawal and Hezbollah's removal from the area. Thousands of residents returned to towns and villages near the border, despite warnings that the region was unsafe. The Israeli military said it had fired ""warning shots in multiple areas"", without specifying if people had been hit, and apprehended several people it claimed posed an ""imminent threat"". Israel said the 60-day ceasefire agreement with Hezbollah had not been fully implemented. It is not clear how many of its soldiers are still in Lebanon or how long they would stay.   The ceasefire came into force in November. Lebanon's health ministry said Israeli forces attacked people as they tried to enter locations that were still under occupation. Women were among the dead, it said, while the injured also included women, children and a paramedic. The Lebanese army said one of its soldiers had been killed and another wounded by Israeli fire. The ceasefire deal, which was brokered by the US and France and put an end to 14 months of conflict, stipulated the withdrawal of Israeli troops and the removal of Hezbollah fighters and weapons from southern Lebanon. At the same time, thousands of Lebanese soldiers were expected to be deployed to the area where, for decades, Hezbollah has been the dominant force. A Western diplomatic official familiar with the negotiations, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Israel had said it needed more time to destroy Hezbollah's infrastructure in southern Lebanon, and that the initial plan was for a 30-day extension. In recent days, Hezbollah's TV station Al Manar appeared to encourage people to return south and, in some places, convoys arrived waving the yellow and green flag of the group. The passing of the ceasefire deadline is the first major test for the new Lebanese president, army chief Joseph Aoun, who is keen to bring stability to a country exhausted by multiple crises. The presence of Israeli troops will be seen as a source of concern for many in Lebanon as Israel occupied the country's south for 18 years, between 1982 and 2000. In a statement on Sunday, President Aoun said Lebanon's ""sovereignty and territorial integrity are non-negotiable"", adding that he was ""following this issue at the highest levels"". Meanwhile, Hezbollah called on the ""international community, led by countries sponsoring agreement, to assume their responsibilities in face of Israeli violations and to oblige its complete withdrawal"" from Lebanon. The conflict escalated last September, leading to an intense Israeli air campaign across Lebanon, the assassination of Hezbollah's senior leaders and a ground invasion of southern Lebanon. The offensive killed around 4,000 people in Lebanon - including many civilians - and led to the displacement of more than 1.2 million residents. On Friday, the office of the Israeli prime minister said the withdrawal outlined in the ceasefire was ""conditioned on the Lebanese army deploying in southern Lebanon and fully and effectively enforcing the agreement, while Hezbollah withdraws beyond the Litani"", a river about 30km (20 miles) from the unofficial border between Lebanon and Israel known as the Blue Line. ""Since the ceasefire agreement has yet to be fully enforced by the Lebanese state, the gradual withdrawal process will continue, in full coordination with the US,"" the statement said. In a statement on Saturday, the Lebanese army said it continued to ""implement the plan to enhance deployment"" in areas along the border, but that there had been ""delays in some stages due to the Israeli enemy's procrastination in withdrawing, complicating the army's deployment mission"". Hezbollah, an Iranian-backed militant, political and social movement, was severely weakened in the conflict with Israel, although it continues to enjoy significant support among Shia Muslims in Lebanon. The ceasefire deal was widely considered as a surrender by the group, after it saw its infrastructure and weapons arsenal depleted and hundreds of fighters and key figures killed, including long-time leader Hassan Nasrallah. Despite some violations before the withdrawal deadline, the truce put an end to the violence which caused billions of dollars in destruction and damage, allowing thousands of residents to return to their homes in Lebanon. If it decides to resume its attacks, Hezbollah will face opposition from critics, who had accused the group of dragging Lebanon into a war that was not in the country's interests, and possibly even from some of its own supporters. Hezbollah's political influence has diminished, too. Earlier this month, Lebanon's parliament was able to elect a president after more than two years of political impasse blamed by critics on the group. President Aoun has promised ambitious reforms to rebuild state institutions long plagued by corruption, revive the collapsed economy after years of crisis, and the right to monopolise the possession of weapons, which would mean trying to curb Hezbollah's military power. It remains unclear whether the army is able - and willing - to do so, amid concerns that any action against the group could spark internal violence. Israel's stated goal in its war against Hezbollah was to allow the return of about 60,000 residents who had been displaced from communities in the country's north because of the group's attacks, and to remove it from areas along the border. Hezbollah launched its campaign the day after the Hamas attacks on southern Israel on 7 October 2023, saying it was acting in solidarity with Palestinians in Gaza."

""My beauty. You're a hero. You're home. That's it,"" her mother says as the three laugh and cry together. The moment, filmed by the Israeli military, was the first time the family had seen each other in more than 15 months. Liri was among the first Israelis to be taken hostage in the 7 October 2023 Hamas attack, when the military base on the Gaza border where she was serving was overrun. She was among four female soldiers to be returned to Israel on Saturday as part of the first phase of a ceasefire agreement with Hamas. Two hundred Palestinian prisoners were released in return. ""The feeling of relief and happiness envelops us after 477 long and unbearable days of nerve-wracking waiting,"" her family said in a statement shortly after her return. Crowds had gathered in Hostages Square in Tel Aviv on Saturday morning, watching a live news feed from Gaza on a large screen as they waited for the group to be brought back to Israel. Released alongside Liri were soldiers Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa and Naama Levy, all aged 20. Cheers erupted as the women appeared, flanked by masked gunmen from Hamas's al-Qassam Brigades, for a staged handover in Gaza City's Palestine Square. They held hands and waved, before being taken away in Red Cross vehicles. ""It's amazing. They're amazing. Did you see them stand and smile?"" one woman watching the live feed with the crowd in Tel Aviv said. In the crowd watching in Gaza, one man told the BBC Hamas was returning the hostages in an ""honourable way"" and declared the moment a victory for the group. The women were then transferred to the Israeli military and later brought by helicopter to a hospital.  In a press briefing, the director of Beilinson Hospital, Dr Lena Koren Feldman, described the released hostages as being in a ""stable condition"", but said they would continue to be given a ""comprehensive medical and emotional evaluation"". They were the second group of hostages to be released under a ceasefire deal, aimed at bringing a permanent end to the war, which began a week ago following months of negotiations. The four women were taken hostage on 7 October from the Nahal Oz military base, about a kilometre from the Gaza border fence. They were part of an unarmed all-female unit of observers, known as tatzpitaniyot in Hebrew, whose role was to study live surveillance footage captured by cameras along the high-tech fence and look out for signs of anything suspicious. Several conscripts from the unit and families of those who were killed have said that they had been warning that an attack was coming in the months before 7 October. It was clear there was a ""balloon that was going to burst"", one told the BBC. The Israeli military has previously said it is in the midst of a ""thorough investigation into the events of 7 October, including those in Nahal Oz, and the circumstances preceding"". One woman from the unit, Agam Berger, remains in Gaza. In a statement on Saturday, her family said they were ""overjoyed and moved"" by the return of the four others, while they continued to ""eagerly await embracing Agam, God willing, in the coming week"". Another woman who served in the unit with them, but was not on shift on 7 October, told the BBC: ""I have been very emotional… This feels like sisters coming home."" ""God willing, we will all sit together and talk, but of course no pressure. They have to heal first."" For families of the observers who were killed on 7 October, it was a bittersweet moment. ""This is a very emotional day for us,"" said Elad Levy, whose niece Roni Eshel served alongside the four women but was killed in the attacks. ""We are very happy to see Karina, Daniella, Liri and Naama coming back home to their families. At the same time, we remember that there are hostages still in Gaza. And for us, we remember Roni who will never come back home."" Israel had expected female civilian hostage Arbel Yehud to be included in Saturday's release, and accused Hamas of breaching the terms of the ceasefire to prioritise female civilians. Hamas said Ms Yehud would be released next weekend. Another female civilian who is yet to be released is Shiri Bibas, who was taken hostage with her husband and two young children, Ariel and Kfir."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xqv5rqpyjo,Hamas names next Israeli hostages set to be released,2025-01-24T17:24:02.096Z,Raffi Berg,"Hamas has named four hostages to be released on Saturday under the Gaza ceasefire deal. It says they are soldiers Karina Ariev, Daniella Gilboa, Naama Levy and Liri Albag. They will be freed in exchange for 180 Palestinian prisoners held in Israel. It will be the second such exchange since the ceasefire came into effect last Sunday. Three hostages and 90 prisoners were released in the first swap. The ceasefire halted the war which began when Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023. About 1,200 people were killed and 251 taken back to Gaza as hostages. More than 47,200 Palestinians, the majority civilians, have been killed in Israel's offensive, Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry says. It was originally thought that a female Israeli civilian, Arbel Yehud, would be included in the list of those to be released on Saturday. It is unclear why her name is not on the list, though Israeli media reported that Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), a separate group, is holding her. Hamas is expected to provide information about the remaining 26 hostages due to be released over the next five weeks. This includes the Bibas family - two parents and two children, one of whom, Kfir, was 10 months old when taken captive and is the youngest hostage. It is unclear if this information will include the names or just the number of living or dead hostages. The prisoners who will be released are of a more serious category than those freed in the first exchange. They will include those who have killed, some of whom are serving sentences of more than 15 years. Israel has insisted that no-one who was involved in the 7 October attacks will be freed. Ariev, Gilboa, Levy and Albag were seized at the Nahal Oz military base which was overrun by Hamas gunmen. Footage showed them among a group of women being tied up with their hands behind their backs. They were seen pleading for help while being taunted by their captors. The women were part of a unit which surveilled the Israel-Gaza border. Three weeks ago Hamas released a video of Albag, 19, calling for the Israeli government to reach a deal. The ceasefire was concluded after months of indirect negotiations between Israel and Hamas, led by the US, Qatar and Egypt. It will be implemented in three stages, with the second stage due to begin six weeks into the truce. About 1,900 Palestinian prisoners will be released during the first stage in exchange for 33 hostages. Israeli forces will also begin withdrawing from positions in Gaza and hundreds of thousands of displaced Palestinians will be able to return to areas they had fled or been forced from. The ceasefire is meant to lead to a permanent end to the war in Gaza. Ninety-one hostages taken on 7 October 2023 are still held in Gaza. Fifty-seven of them are assumed by Israel to still be alive. Three others - two of whom are alive - have been held for a decade or more. Three female Israeli hostages have already been released as part of the latest ceasefire and hostage release deal. Romi Gonen, 24, was captured as she tried to escape the Nova music festival when it was targeted by the militant group as part of the 7 October 2023 attack. She has been freed alongside Doron Steinbrecher, 31, a veterinary nurse, and Emily Damari, 28, who holds dual British-Israeli nationality. All three arrived back in Israel on Sunday after being released by Hamas in Gaza, and were reunited with their families."

The UN said that it was actively engaging with senior Houthi officials to try to secure the release of all its detained employees. There has been no official statement from the Houthis as yet. This is not the first time that the group has detained UN workers - a number of staff members were held last year. The Houthis have also detained some 20 Yemeni employees of the US embassy for the past three years. Human rights groups also accuse the movement of having kidnapped, tortured and held in arbitrary detention hundreds of civilians. The Iranian-backed Houthis have been fighting a Saudi-led coalition in Yemen for almost a decade. The conflict, which erupted after the Houthis forced out the then Yemeni government, has largely been at a standstill for the past two years. But the Houthis have drawn renewed international attention with their targeting of ships in the Red Sea and their firing of rockets towards Israel in the past fifteen months, which they say is in support of Hamas and the Palestinians. Their actions have triggered reprisal strikes on Houthi positions in Yemen from the US, Israel and the UK. Since the ceasefire in Gaza began, the Houthis have said they will decrease their attacks on shipping and stop firing at Israel if it continues with the truce. One of President Trump's first acts on taking office has been, however, to order the Houthis to be put back on the US list of foreign terrorist organisations. Despite all this, the group remains in control of large areas of Yemen. The country was the poorest in the Middle East before the war began in 2015. Hundreds of thousands of people have since died in the fighting or from disease and hunger exacerbated by the conflict. UN agencies provide a vital lifeline for millions of Yemenis with their food and medical aid. But they have regularly had problems reaching people in more remote areas outside the major towns and cities, with Houthi officials regularly reported to have obstructed the delivery of humanitarian assistance in the regions they control."
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgrn0nwn0eqo,IDF said bombed apartments were Hezbollah base - but most killed were civilians,2025-01-24T05:30:00.657Z,Nawal al-Maghafi,"Julia Ramadan was terrified - the war between Israel and Hezbollah was escalating and she'd had a nightmare that her family home was being bombed. When she sent her brother a panicked voice note from her apartment in Beirut, he encouraged her to join him in Ain El Delb, a sleepy village in southern Lebanon. ""It's safe here,"" he reassured her. ""Come stay with us until things calm down."" Earlier that month, Israel intensified air campaigns against Hezbollah in Lebanon, in response to escalating rocket attacks by the Iran-backed armed group which had killed civilians, and displaced tens of thousands more from homes in northern Israel. Ashraf was confident their family's apartment block would be a haven, so Julia joined him. But the next day, on 29 September, it was subject to this conflict's deadliest single Israeli attack. Struck by Israeli missiles, the entire six-storey building collapsed, killing 73 people. The Israel Defense Forces (IDF) says the building was targeted because it was a Hezbollah ""terrorist command centre"" and it ""eliminated"" a Hezbollah commander. It added that ""the overwhelming majority"" of those killed in the strike were ""confirmed to be terror operatives"". But a BBC Eye investigation verified the identity of 68 of the 73 people killed in the attack and uncovered evidence suggesting just six were linked to Hezbollah's military wing. None of those we identified appeared to hold a senior rank. The BBC's World Service also found that the other 62 were civilians - 23 of them children. Among the dead were babies only a few months old, like Nouh Kobeissi in apartment -2B. In apartment -1C, school teacher Abeer Hallak was killed alongside her husband and three sons. Three floors above, Amal Hakawati died along with three generations of her family - her husband, children and two granddaughters. Ashraf and Julia had always been close, sharing everything with each other. ""She was like a black box, holding all my secrets,"" he says. On the afternoon of 29 September, the siblings had just returned home from handing out food to families who had fled the fighting. Hundreds of thousands of people in Lebanon had been displaced by the war. Ashraf was in the shower, and Julia was sitting in the living room with their father, helping him upload a video to social media. Their mother, Janan, was in the kitchen, clearing up. Then, without warning, they heard a deafening bang. The entire building shook, and a massive cloud of dust and smoke poured into their apartment. ""I shouted, 'Julia! Julia!,'"" says Ashraf. ""She replied, 'I'm here.' ""I looked at my dad, who was struggling to get up from the sofa because of an existing injury to his leg, and saw my mother running toward the front door."" Julia's nightmare was playing out in real life. ""Julia was hyperventilating, crying so hard on the sofa. I was trying to calm her down and told her we needed to get out. Then, there was another attack."" Video footage of the strike, shared online and verified by the BBC, reveals four Israeli missiles flying through the air towards the building. Seconds later, the block collapses. Ashraf, along with many others, was trapped under the rubble. He began calling out, but the only voice he could hear was that of his father, who told him he could still hear Julia and that she was alive. Neither of them could hear Ashraf's mother. Ashraf sent a voice note to friends in the neighbourhood to alert them. The next few hours were agonising. He could hear rescuers sifting through the debris - and residents wailing as they discovered loved ones dead. ""I just kept thinking, please, God, not Julia. I can't live this life without Julia."" Ashraf was finally pulled from the rubble hours later, with only minor injuries. He discovered his mother had been rescued but died in hospital. Julia had suffocated under the rubble. His father later told him Julia's last words were calls for her brother. In November, a ceasefire deal was agreed between Israel and Hezbollah with the aim of ending the conflict. The deal gives a 60-day deadline for Israeli forces to withdraw from southern Lebanon and for Hezbollah to withdraw its forces and weapons north of the Litani River. As this 26 January deadline approaches, we sought to find out more about the deadliest single Israeli attack on Lebanon in years. In the apartment below Julia and Ashraf's, Hawraa and Ali Fares had been hosting family members displaced by the war. Among them was Hawraa's sister Batoul, who, like Julia, had arrived the previous day - with her husband and two young children. They had fled intense bombardment near the Lebanon-Israel border, in areas where Hezbollah has a strong presence. ""We hesitated about where to go,"" says Batoul. ""And then I told my husband, 'Let's go to Ain El Delb. My sister said their building was safe and that they couldn't hear any bombing nearby.'"" Batoul's husband Mohammed Fares was killed in the Ain El Delb attack. A pillar fell on Batoul and her children. She says no-one responded to her calls for help. She finally managed to lift it alone, but her four-year-old daughter Hawraa had been fatally crushed. Miraculously, her baby Malak survived. Three floors below Batoul lived Denise and Moheyaldeen Al-Baba. That Sunday, Denise had invited her brother Hisham over for lunch. The impact of the strike was brutal, says Hisham. ""The second missile slammed me to the floor… the entire wall fell on top of me."" He spent seven hours under the rubble. ""I heard a voice far away. People talking. Screams and… 'Cover her. Remove her. Lift the stone. He's still alive. It's a child. Lift this child.' I mean… Oh my God. I thought to myself, I'm the last one deep underground. No-one will know about me. I will die here."" When Hisham was finally rescued, he found his niece's fiance waiting to hear if she was alive. He lied to him and told him she was fine. They found her body three days later. Hisham lost four members of his family - his sister, brother-in-law and their two children. He told us he had lost his faith and no longer believes in God. To find out more about who died, we have analysed Lebanese Health Ministry data, videos, social media posts, as well as speaking to survivors of the attack. We particularly wanted to interrogate the IDF's response to media - immediately following the attack - that the apartment block had been a Hezbollah command centre. We asked the IDF multiple times what constituted a command centre, but it did not give clarification. So we began sifting through social media tributes, gravesites, public health records and videos of funerals to determine whether those killed in the attack had any military affiliation with Hezbollah. We could only find evidence that six of the 68 dead we identified were connected to Hezbollah's military wing. Hezbollah memorial photos for the six men use the label ""Mujahid"", meaning ""fighter"". Senior figures, by contrast, are referred to as ""Qaid"", meaning ""commander"" - and we found no such labels used by the group to describe those killed. We asked the IDF whether the six Hezbollah fighters we identified were the intended targets of the strike. It did not respond to this question. One of the Hezbollah fighters we identified was Batoul's husband, Mohammed Fares. Batoul told us that her husband, like many other men in southern Lebanon, was a reservist for the group, though she added that he had never been paid by Hezbollah, held a formal rank, or participated in combat. Israel sees Hezbollah as one of its main threats and the group is designated a terrorist organisation by Israel, many Western governments and Gulf Arab states. But alongside its large, well-armed military wing, Hezbollah is also an influential political party, holding seats in Lebanese parliament. In many parts of the country it is woven into the social fabric, providing a network of social services. In response to our investigation, the IDF stated: ""The IDF's strikes on military targets are subject to relevant provisions of international law, including taking feasible precautions, and are carried out after an assessment that the expected collateral damage and civilian casualties are not excessive in relation to the military advantage expected from the strike."" It had earlier also told the BBC it had executed ""evacuation procedures"" for the strike on Ain El Delb, but everyone we spoke to said they had received no warning. Watch on YouTube if outside the UK UN experts have raised concerns about the proportionality and necessity of Israeli air strikes on residential buildings in densely populated areas in Lebanon. This pattern of targeting entire buildings - resulting in significant civilian casualties - has been a recurring feature of Israel's latest conflict with Hezbollah, which began when the group escalated rocket attacks in response to Israel's war in Gaza. Between October 2023 and November 2024, Lebanese authorities say more than 3,960 people were killed in Lebanon by Israeli forces, many of them civilians. Over the same time period, Israeli authorities say at least 47 civilians were killed by Hezbollah rockets fired from southern Lebanon. At least 80 Israeli soldiers were also killed fighting in southern Lebanon or as a result of rocket attacks on northern Israel. The missile strike in Ain El Delb is the deadliest Israeli attack on a building in Lebanon for at least 18 years. The village remains haunted by its impact. When we visited, more than a month after the strike, a father continued to visit the site every day, hoping for news of his 11-year-old son, whose body had yet to be found. Ashraf Ramadan, too, returns to sift through the rubble, searching for what remains of the memories his family built over the two decades they lived there. He shows me the door of his wardrobe, still adorned with pictures of footballers and pop stars he once admired. Then, he pulls a teddy bear from the debris and tells me it was always on his bed. ""Nothing I find here will make up for the people we lost,"" he says. Additional reporting by Scarlett Barter and Jake Tacchi"
https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cq8k5je1dwvo,Israel's security chief says focus switching to West Bank,2025-01-23T20:42:58.622Z,Lucy Williamson,"Days into the Gaza ceasefire, the head of Israel's Shin Bet security service has signalled that the country's focus is switching to Palestinian armed groups in the occupied West Bank. Ronen Bar said Israel was in the midst of a multi-front campaign, but that ""right now, it's Samaria's [northern West Bank] time"". Israeli forces have been carrying out a major military operation in and around the West Bank city of Jenin since Tuesday. The Israeli army's chief, Lt Gen Herzi Halevi, has talked of bringing Jenin to ""a different place"" through continued military pressure there. Army vehicles are currently controlling the entrance to Jenin's main hospital, and have blocked access to Jenin refugee camp - home to both civilians and armed Palestinian groups. The roads into the camp - some of them torn up by military bulldozers - are guarded by small groups of soldiers, who raised their weapons when we approached. On Thursday, a stream of men, women and children left the camp, picking their way past the military vehicles and over the rubble of the road, to the sound of explosions and gunfire behind them. ""The situation is horrible,"" said Adel, a taxi driver. ""I live on al-Awda Street, and I'm the last one to leave. There's no one there."" Adel said the army had dropped leaflets in the camp, telling people to leave their homes. ""Everyone has to leave before 17:00,"" he told me. ""God knows what they're going to do."" Many of those leaving the camp on Thursday, clutching children, pets and plastic bags full of clothes, told us they had received instructions from the army to leave - either by announcements from drones or trucks, or through the leaflets. The BBC has seen photos of leaflets said to have been dropped inside the camp, and heard recordings believed to be of the Israeli announcements, which appear to corroborate what the residents said. But Israel's government spokesman, David Mencer, told journalists in a briefing that there had been ""no evacuation orders whatsoever"" for the people of Jenin. ""People in Jenin not connected with terrorism are free to leave, to get away from our action,"" he said. But he described reports of evacuation orders as ""fake news, probably spread by supporters of Hamas"". Israel says it aims to destroy the armed groups here - backed by Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad - and stop them carrying out attacks against Israeli targets. It is worried about the West Bank becoming the next focus for Iranian influence and arms. But a show of force here after the ceasefire in Gaza also plays well with those in Israel who not only want to continue the war there, but want to annex the West Bank as well. Twelve Palestinians are reported to have been killed in the operation and dozens injured, including two men suspected of murdering three Israelis in a shooting attack earlier this month. Qutaiba Shalabi and Mohammed Nazzal were killed after a fierce gun battle with Israeli forces on Wednesday night in Burqin, just west of Jenin. Hamas put out a statement claiming them as its fighters. But civilians have also been killed during the operation. Ahmed al-Shayeb owned a mobile phone shop in Jenin - a well-known businessman, not a fighter, locals said. He was shot dead by Israeli forces, as he drove down a road near Jenin's refugee camp, with his 10-year-old son Taym in the car. ""They started shooting, and a bullet hit him,"" Taym told reporters at his father's funeral on Wednesday. ""He said, 'God, God,' then the car hit the pavement. I saw two army vehicles coming toward us. They started to shoot towards the car, but I jumped out and ran away."" Israel's army says the incident is under review. Many people here told us this raid felt different to the many others Israel has carried out since Hamas's 7 October 2023 attack on Israel, which triggered the war in Gaza. ""It's different this time - they're striking everywhere. It's like Gaza,"" one man told me, as he left the camp on Wednesday. Next to him, 52-year-old Kefah Sehwal said she had lost 15 members of her family in the past 15 months. ""After what happened to [Israeli forces] in Gaza, the reaction is here,"" she told me. ""They're taking it out on us."" Israel's Defence Minister, Israel Katz, has talked about a ""shift in strategy"" for this operation, saying the lesson from Gaza is not just to ""eliminate terrorists"", as he put it, but to stop them coming back. That plan didn't work in Gaza. It's not clear it'll work in Jenin."
