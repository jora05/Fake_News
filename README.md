## Project Overview

A project utilizing logistic regression for classifying news articles as reliable or fake typically involves several key steps. It begins with text preprocessing, which includes cleaning the data, tokenization, and vectorization to convert text into numerical format. 
The logistic regression model is then trained on this processed data, and evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are used to assess its performance in detecting misinformation.
